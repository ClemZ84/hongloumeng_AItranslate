  "original": "话说凤姐正与平儿说话，只见有人回说：“瑞大爷来了。”凤姐命：“请进来罢。”贾瑞见请，心中暗喜，见了凤姐，满面陪笑，连连问好。凤姐儿也假意殷勤让坐让茶。贾瑞见凤姐如此打扮，越发酥倒，因饧了眼问道：“二哥哥怎么还不回来？”凤姐道：“不知什么缘故。”贾瑞笑道：“别是路上有人绊住了脚，舍不得回来了罢？”凤姐道：“可知男人家见一个爱一个也是有的。”贾瑞笑道：“嫂子这话错了，我就不是这样人。”凤姐笑道：“象你这样的人能有几个呢，十个里也挑不出一个来。”贾瑞听了，喜的抓耳挠腮，又道：“嫂子天天也闷的很。”凤姐道：“正是呢，只盼个人来说话解解闷儿。”贾瑞笑道：“我倒天天闲着。若天天过来替嫂子解解闷儿可好么？”凤姐笑道：“你哄我呢！你那里肯往我这里来？”贾瑞道：“我在嫂子面前若有一句谎话，天打雷劈！只因素日闻得人说，嫂子是个利害人，在你跟前一点也错不得，所以唬住我了。我如今见嫂子是个有说有笑极疼人的，我怎么不来？死了也情愿。”凤姐笑道：“果然你是个明白人，比蓉儿兄弟两个强远了。我看他那样清秀，只当他们心里明白，谁知竟是两个糊涂虫，一点不知人心。”\n　　贾瑞听这话，越发撞在心坎上，由不得又往前凑一凑，觑着眼看凤姐的荷包，又问：“戴着什么戒指？”凤姐悄悄的道：“放尊重些，别叫丫头们看见了。”贾瑞如听纶音佛语一般，忙往后退。凤姐笑道：“你该去了。”贾瑞道：“我再坐一坐儿，好狠心的嫂子！”凤姐儿又悄俏的道：“大天白日人来人往，你就在这里也不方便。你且去，等到晚上起了更你来，悄悄的在西边穿堂儿等我。”贾瑞听了，如得珍宝，忙问道：“你别哄我。但是那里人过的多，怎么好躲呢？”凤姐道：“你只放心，我把上夜的小厮们都放了假，两边门一关，再没别人了。”贾瑞听了，喜之不尽，忙忙的告辞而去，心内以为得手。\n　　盼到晚上，果然黑地里摸人荣府，趁掩门时钻入穿堂。果见漆黑无一人来往，贾母那边去的门已倒锁了，只有向东的门未关。贾瑞侧耳听着，半日不见人来。忽听咯噔一声，东边的门也关上了。贾瑞急的也不敢则声，只得悄悄出来，将门撼了撼，关得铁捅一般，此时要出去亦不能了，南北俱是大墙，要跳也无攀援。这屋内又是过堂风，空落落的。现是腊月天气，夜又长，朔风凛凛，侵肌裂骨，一夜几乎不曾冻死。好容易盼到早晨，只见一个老婆子先将东门开了进来，去叫西门，贾瑞瞅他背着脸，一溜烟抱了肩跑出来。幸而天气尚早，人都未起，从后门一径跑回家去。  　　原来贾瑞父母早亡，只有他祖父代儒教养。那代儒素日教训最严，不许贾瑞多走一步，生怕他在外吃酒赌钱，有误学业。今忽见他一夜不归，只料定他在外非饮即赌，膘娼宿妓，那里想到这段公案？因此也气了一夜。贾瑞也捻着一把汗，少不得回来撒谎，只说：“往舅舅家去了，天黑了，留我住了一夜。”代儒道：“自来出门非禀我不敢擅出，如何昨日私自去了？据此也该打，何况是撒谎？”因此发狠，按倒打了三四十板，还不许他吃饭，叫他跪在院内读文章，定要补出十天工课来方罢。贾瑞先冻了一夜，又挨了打，又饿着肚子，跪在风地里念文章，其苦万状。此时贾瑞邪心未改，再不想到凤姐捉弄他。过了两日，得了空儿，仍找寻凤姐。凤姐故意抱怨他失信，贾瑞急的起誓。凤姐因他自投罗网，少不的再寻别计令他知改，故又约他道：“今日晚上，你别在那里了，你在我这房后小过道儿里头那间空屋子里等我。可别冒撞了！”贾瑞道：“果真么？”凤姐道：“你不信就别来！”贾瑞道：“必来，必来！死也要来的。”凤姐道：“这会子你先去罢。”贾瑞料定晚间必妥，此时先去了。凤姐在这里便点兵派将，设下圈套。\n　　那贾瑞只盼不到晚，偏偏家里亲戚又来了，吃了晚饭才去，那天已有掌灯时候；又等他祖父安歇，方溜进荣府，往那夹道中屋子里来等着，热锅上蚂蚁一般。只是左等不见人影，右听也没声响，心中害怕，不住猜疑道：“别是不来了，又冻我一夜不成？”正自胡猜，只见黑黝黝的进来一个人。贾瑞便打定是凤姐，不管青红皂白，那人刚到面前，便如饿虎扑食，猫儿捕鼠的一般抱住，叫道：“亲嫂子，等死我了！”说着，抱到屋里炕上就亲嘴扯裤子，满口里“亲爹”“亲娘”的乱叫起来。那人只不做声，贾瑞便扯下自己的裤子来，硬帮帮就想顶入。忽然灯光一闪，只见贾蔷举着个蜡台，照道：“谁在这屋里呢？”只见炕上那人笑道：“瑞大叔要我呢！”\n　　贾瑞不看则已，看了时真羞的无地可入。你道是谁？却是贾蓉。贾瑞回身要跑，被贾蔷一把揪住道：“别走！如今琏二婶子已经告到太太眼前，说你调戏他，他暂时稳住你在这里。太太听见气死过去了，这会子叫我来拿你。快跟我走罢！”贾瑞听了，魂不附体，只说：“好侄儿！你只说没有我，我明日重重的谢你！”贾蔷道：“放你不值什么，只不知你谢我多少？况且口说无凭，写一张文契才算。”贾瑞道：“这怎么落纸呢？”贾蔷道：“这也不妨，写个赌钱输了，借银若干两就完了。”贾瑞道：“这也容易。”贾蔷翻身出来，纸笔现成，拿来叫贾瑞写。他两个做好做歹，只写了五十两银子，画了押，贾蔷收起来。然后撕掳贾蓉。贾蓉先咬定牙不依，只说：“明日告诉族中的人评评理。”贾瑞急的至于磕头。贾蔷做好做歹的，也写了一张五十两欠契才罢。贾蔷又道：“如今要放你，我就担着不是。老太太那边的门早已关了。老爷正在厅上看南京来的东西，那一条路定难过去。如今只好走后门。要这一走，倘或遇见了人，连我也不好。等我先去探探，再来领你。这屋里你还藏不住，少时就来堆东西，等我寻个地方。”说毕，拉着贾瑞，仍息了灯，出至院外，摸着大台阶底下，说道：“这窝儿里好。只蹲着，别哼一声。等我来再走。”说毕，二人去了。\n　　贾瑞此时身不由己，只得蹲在那台阶下。正要盘算，只听头顶上一声响，哗喇喇一净桶尿粪从上面直泼下来，可巧浇了他一身一头。贾瑞掌不住“嗳哟”一声，忙又掩住口，不敢声张，满头满脸皆是尿屎，浑身冰冷打战。只见贾蔷跑来叫：“快走，快走！”贾瑞方得了命，三步两步从后门跑到家中，天已三更，只得叫开了门。家人见他这般光景，问：“是怎么了？”少不得撒谎说：“天黑了，失脚掉在茅厕里了。”一面即到自己房中更衣洗濯。心下方想到凤姐玩他，因此发一回狠。再想想凤姐的模样儿标致，又恨不得一时搂在怀里。胡思乱想，一夜也不曾合眼。自此虽想凤姐，只不敢往荣府去了。\n　　贾蓉等两个常常来要银子，他又怕祖父知道。正是相思尚且难禁，况又添了债务，日间工课又紧，他二十来岁的人，尚末娶亲，想着凤姐不得到手，自不免有些“指头儿告了消乏”，更兼两回冻恼奔波。因此，三五下里夹攻，不觉就得了一病。心内发膨胀，口内无滋味，脚下如绵，眼中似醋，黑夜作烧，白日常倦，下溺遗精，嗽痰带血，诸如此症，不上一年都添全了。于是不能支持，一头躺倒，合上眼还只梦魂颠倒，满口胡话，惊怖异常。百般请医疗治，诸如肉桂、附子、鳖甲、麦冬、玉竹等药吃了有几十斤下去，也不见个动静。\n　　倏又腊尽春回，这病更加沉重。代儒也着了忙，各处请医疗治，皆不见效。因后来吃“独参汤”，代儒如何有这力量，只得往荣府里来寻。王夫人命凤姐秤二两给他。凤姐回说：“前儿新近替老太太配了药，那整的太太又说留着送杨提督的太太配药，偏偏昨儿我已经叫人送了去了。”王夫人道：“就是咱们这边没了，你叫个人往你婆婆那里问问，或是你珍大哥哥那里有，寻些来凑着给人家。吃好了，救人一命，也是你们的好处。”凤姐应了，也不遣人去寻。只将些渣末凑了几钱，命人送去，只说：“太太叫送来的，再也没了。”然后向王夫人说：“都寻了来了，共凑了二两多，送去了。”\n　　那贾瑞此时要命心急，无药不吃，只是白花钱不见效。忽然这日有个跛足道人来化斋，口称专治冤孽之症。贾瑞偏偏在内听见了，直着声叫喊，说：“快去请进那位菩萨来救命！”一面在枕头上磕头。众人只得带进那道士来。贾瑞一把拉住，连叫“菩萨救我！”那道士叹道：“你这病非药可医。我有个宝贝与你，你天天看时，此命可保矣。”说毕，从搭裢中取出个正面反面皆可照人的镜子来，背上錾着“风月宝鉴”四字，递与贾瑞道：“这物出自太虚幻境空灵殿上，警幻仙子所制，专治邪思妄动之症，有济世保生之功。所以带他到世上来，单与那些聪明俊秀、风雅王孙等照看。千万不可照正面，只照背面，要紧，要紧！三日后我来收取，管叫你病好。”说毕，徉长而去。众人苦留不住。\n　　贾瑞接了镜子，想道：“这道士倒有意思，我何不照一照试试？”想毕，拿起那宝鉴来，向反面一照。只见一个骷髅儿，立在里面。贾瑞忙掩了，骂那道士：“混帐，如何吓我！我倒再照照正面是什么？”想着，便将正面一照，只见凤姐站在里面招手儿叫他。贾瑞心中一喜，荡悠悠觉得进了镜子，与凤姐云雨一番，凤姐仍送他出来。到了床上，“嗳哟”了一声，一睁眼，镜子从新又掉过来，仍是反面立着一个骷髅。贾瑞自觉汗津津的，底下已遗了一滩精。心中到底不足，又翻过正面来，只见凤姐还招手叫他，他又进去。如此三四次。到了这次，刚要出镜子来，只见两个人走来，拿铁锁把他套住，拉了就走。贾瑞叫道：“让我拿了镜子再走！”只说这句就再不能说话了。旁边伏侍的人只见他先还拿着镜子照，落下来，仍睁开眼拾在手内，末后镜子掉下来，便不动了。众人上来看时，已经咽了气了，身子底下冰凉精湿，遗下了一大滩精。这才忙着穿衣抬床。代儒夫妇哭的死去活来，大骂道士：“是何妖道！”遂命起火来烧那镜子。只听空中叫道：“谁叫他自己照了正面呢！你们自己以假为真，为何烧我此镜？”忽见那镜从房中飞出。代儒出门看时，却还是那个跛足道人，喊道：“还我的风月宝鉴来！”说着，抢了镜子，眼看着他飘然去了。  　　当下代儒没法，只得料理丧事，各处去报。三日起经，七日发引，寄灵铁槛寺后。一时贾家众人齐来吊问。荣府贾赦赠银二十两，贾政也是二十两，宁府贾珍亦有二十两，其馀族中人贫富不一，或一二两、三四两不等。外又有各同窗家中分资，也凑了二三十两。代儒家道虽然淡薄，得此帮助，倒也丰丰富富完了此事。\n谁知这年冬底，林如海因为身染重疾，写书来特接黛玉回去。贾母听了，未免又加忧闷，只得忙忙的打点黛玉起身。宝玉大不自在，争奈父女之情，也不好拦阻。于是贾母定要贾琏送他去，仍叫带回来。一应土仪盘费，不消絮说，自然要妥帖的。作速择了日期，贾琏同着黛玉辞别了众人，带领仆从，登舟往扬州去了。\n要知端的，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "As Xifeng was talking to Pinger, a maid announced that Master Jia Rui had called and was told to come in. Delighted by this summons, he entered beaming and bowed to Xifeng who made a show of returning his courtesy and urging him to be seated. She served tea herself.\n\nHis heart melted at the sight of her in this charming mood.\n\n“Why hasn’t Master Lian come home yet?” he asked with a sugary smile.\n\n“I’ve no idea.”\n\n“Perhaps he’s been waylaid by some wench and can’t tear himself away.”\n\n“Men are like that,” she sighed. “They’re always falling for other women.”\n\n“You’re wrong there, sister-in-law. I’m not one of that sort.”\n\n“How many men are like you? Not one in ten.”\n\nJia Rui was so flattered he scratched his head and grinned.\n\n“You must often feel lonely, sister-in-law,” he ventured.\n\n“Yes, indeed. I wish someone would drop in for a chat to while the time away.”\n\n“I’m always free. How would it be if I came every day to keep you company?”\n\n“You’re joking. You’d never come.”\n\n“May I be struck by lightning if I tell a lie! I used to think you were such a terror, I didn’t dare put a foot wrong. But now I know how kind you can be and what a delightful talker, nothing would keep me away. I’d come even if it cost me my life.”\n\n“It’s good to know you’re so understanding. You’re far superior to those two brothers Rong. They look so refined, you’d think they had good sense; but they’re utterly stupid and don’t understand the least thing about human feelings.”\n\nThis exactly suited Jia Rui’s book. Edging closer he stared at her purse.\n\n“What ring is that you’re wearing?” he asked.\n\n“Do lower your voice,” she whispered. “The maids might hear.”\n\nHe drew back quickly as if she had issued a divine decree.\n\n“You had better go now,” said Xifeng.\n\n“Do let me stay a little longer. How can you be so cruel?”\n\n“In the daytime, with so many people about, it’s not convenient for you to stay here. Go away now and come back after the first watch. You can wait for me secretly in the western entrance hall.”\n\nAs if he had won a treasure, Jia Rui hurried away quite beside himself with joy.\n\nHe looked forward impatiently to the evening. Sure enough, he slipped into the Rong Mansion under cover of darkness and squeezed into the entrance hall just as the gate was being closed. It was pitch dark and not a soul was about. The gate leading to the Lady Dowager’s quarters was already locked. Only the one on the east was still open. He waited for a long time without hearing anyone coming. Then suddenly with a bang the east gate was closed too.\n\nIn desperation he did not dare make a sound. He stole out and tried the gate. It was locked — as fast as if with iron bolts. Escape was now out of the question, for the walls on both sides were too high to scale without a ladder. Moreover the hall was draughty and bare. As it was the depth of winter with long nights and bitter winds, he was nearly frozen to death by morning.\n\nAt long last an old woman arrived to open the east gate. As she passed through to unlock the west gate, Jia Rui slipped out behind her back with a gasp of relief. Luckily it was still early and no one was about. He made his way home from the back door.\n\nNow Jia Rui’s parents had died young and he had been brought up by his grandfather Jia Dairu, a strict disciplinarian who had never allowed him to step out of line for fear the boy might fritter away his time drinking or gambling to the detriment of his studies. The old man never imagined anything like this could happen. He had passed a sleepless night, frantic at Jia Rui’s failure to return. And Jia Rui, going home now with considerable misgiving, had to invent a story.\n\n“I went to my uncle’s and stayed the night there because it was late,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always insisted on your asking leave before going out,” fumed his grandfather. “How dare you spend a night away from home without permission? For that alone I’d be justified in beating you, to say nothing of your lying.”\n\nThe old man thrashed him so hard with a bamboo cane that he could neither stand nor sit down after-wards. Then he made him go without a meal and kneel in the courtyard to learn by heart passages from the Confucian classics, threatening that he would have to make up for the ten days’ work he had missed.\n\nThus Jia Rui had to kneel in the cold wind, reciting his lessons, after a night of exposure, a beating and an empty stomach. Indeed, he was in a pitiable state.\n\nBut still lust had the upper hand and it never occurred to him that Xifeng was making a fool of him. Two days later, as soon as he had a chance, he went back to see her again. She pretended to be displeased because he had failed to keep his appointment, which made him swear most fervently that he had been prevented from coming.\n\nSeeing him so infatuated, Xifeng felt she must think of some other way to cure him and promised to meet him that same evening in a dark passage-room behind her apartment.\n\n“Don’t get there too early,” she warned. “Hide in the empty room at the back of the lobby and wait for my signal.”\n\n“Really?” he asked.\n\n“If you don’t believe me, don’t come.”\n\n“I’ll come, I’ll come! I’d come if it killed me,” he assured her.\n\n“All right. Now you can go.”\n\nConfident that this time he would succeed, Jia Rui went away. And Xifeng summoned her most trusted assistants and laid her plans.\n\nJia Rui could hardly wait for evening. Unfortunately some relatives of his grandfather called and stayed to supper, by which time the lamps were lit; and only when the old man had gone to bed was Jia Rui able to slip over to the Rong Mansion and hide in the dark room behind the lobby. He was on tenterhooks, as if ants were crawling all over him. He peered to right and left, but there was no sign of anyone. He listened, but not a sound could he hear.\n\n“Perhaps she won’t come after all and I shall be left to freeze here again,” he speculated.\n\nHe was胡思乱想 when a dark figure slipped in. Taking this for Xifeng, without waiting to make sure Jia Rui pounced like a hungry tiger or a swooping kite, hugging the newcomer and exclaiming, “Darling, you’ve kept me waiting!”\n\nHe dragged his victim to the kang, showering kisses on her and fumbling with her clothes, muttering endearments all the while. He was so carried away that the other made no resistance. Then he undid his own trousers and prepared to launch his assault. But all of a sudden a light flashed in his face and Jia Qiang holding a candle cried:\n\n“Who’s in there?”\n\nThen the person on the kang giggled.\n\n“Uncle Rui was trying to rape me.”\n\nJia Rui saw to his horror that it was Jia Rong. He wished the earth would swallow him up. He turned to flee but Jia Qiang caught him.\n\n“Don’t go! Aunt Xifeng has reported you to the mistress for trying to seduce her. She sent us to catch you. Come with me to the mistress.”\n\nAt this Jia Rui nearly died of fright.\n\n“Dear nephew,” he pleaded, “just tell her I wasn’t here and I’ll reward you well tomorrow.”\n\n“I might let you off, but how much will you pay? And how can I be sure you’ll keep your word? You must write an IOU.”\n\n“But how can I put that in writing?”\n\n“No problem. Just write that you lost the money gambling and are borrowing so much silver from me.”\n\n“That’s easy.”\n\nJia Qiang disappeared and came back with paper and brush which he made Jia Rui use. Having written a few words, Jia Rui wanted to put down fifty taels.\n\n“That’s not enough,” objected Jia Qiang. “Make it a hundred.”\n\nJia Rui had to comply.\n\nJia Qiang and Jia Rong then insisted on his writing and signing an IOU for fifty taels of silver. This they pocketed before turning their attention to Jia Rong.\n\nJia Rong at first held out adamantly. “Tomorrow I’ll ask the clan to decide who’s in the right,” he threatened.\n\nJia Rui in desperation fell on his knees and knocked his head on the ground, until Jia Qiang as peacemaker made Jia Rong too write an IOU for fifty taels and let the matter drop.\n\n“If we let you go now we’ll be in for trouble,” Jia Qiang told Jia Rui. “The Lady Dowager’s gate is already closed. The master is in the hall looking at some things that have come from Nanking, so you’ll never get out that way. You’ll have to go by the back. But if we run into anyone on the way, we’ll be in the soup too. I’d better go first to scout round, then come back for you. You can’t hide in this room. They’ll be coming any time now to put things away. Wait while I find a place for you.”\n\nTaking Jia Rui, he put out the lamp and led him into the courtyard. Groping under the large step there, he said, “This hollow will do. Squat down and don’t make a sound.”\n\nThen he left.\n\nJia Rui had to crouch as he was told. He was just thinking when he heard a sound above his head. A bucketful of filthy slops came down with a crash, splashing him all over from head to foot. He gasped but dared not cry out. He was covered from head to foot with excrement and urine, shivering with cold.\n\nThen Jia Qiang ran over crying, “Quick, get away!”\n\nOnly then did Jia Rui take to his heels. He scurried out by the back gate and hurried home. It was the third watch, and he had to knock at the gate. When the servants saw him in such a state, they asked what had happened.\n\n“I fell into the cesspool in the dark,” he lied.\n\nHe went to his own room to change his clothes and wash, reflecting that he had been made a fool of by Xifeng. But though he raged against her, the thought of her loveliness made him long to take her in his arms. So his fancies ran wild all night, and he did not close his eyes. After this, although he still yearned for Xifeng, he did not dare to call at the Rong Mansion again.\n\nJia Rong and Jia Qiang often came to dun him for the money, and he was afraid his grandfather might find out. To the torment of his unrequited love was added the anxiety over these debts. His school work kept him busy all day. And being a young fellow of twenty or so who had not yet been married, he could hardly help indulging in certain practices to relieve his tension. Besides, he had been chilled and frightened on two successive nights. Thus assailed from all sides, he fell ill. He suffered from oppression in the heart, loss of appetite, numb limbs and feverish eyes. He ran a temperature at night and was listless by day. His urine was inhibited and he had frequent emissions, while he coughed up phlegm streaked with blood. In less than a year all these symptoms appeared and he collapsed, his mind wandering, his eyes tight shut as he babbled deliriously in his terror. All the remedies they tried, pounds and pounds of cassia bark, aconite, turtle-shell, lilyturf and Solomon’s seal, had no effect at all.\n\nSoon the end of winter gave way to spring and his illness grew even worse. Dairu in desperation called in more doctors, but none of them could cure him. Later he was given ginseng broth, but the old man could not afford to buy enough ginseng and had to go to the Rong Mansion for help. Lady Wang told Xifeng to weigh out two ounces for him.\n\n“We’ve only just got some the other day to make up medicine for the old lady,” said Xifeng. “Her Ladyship means to keep the whole root to make medicine for the wife of the commander-in-chief, and as it happens I sent it to her yesterday.”\n\n“If we’ve none here, send to your mother-in-law for some, or get some from your Cousin Zhen,” said Lady Wang. “If you give the poor fellow enough to cure him, it will be a good deed.”\n\nXifung assented but instead of sending for any ginseng, she took some worthless rootlets, weighed out less than two ounces and dispatched them with the message.\n\n“Her Ladyship sent this, and there’s no more.” She told Lady Wang, “We’ve searched high and low and this is all we could scrape together — just over two taels. We’ve sent it over.”\n\nJia Rui by now was so frantic to save his life that he was ready to try any medicine, but all the money he spent was simply thrown away. One day a lame Taoist priest came to the door to ask for alms and claimed to have specialized in curing diseases due to retribution for sin. Jia Rui, who happened to hear him, called out loudly:\n\n“Quick, fetch in that saviour who can work miracles!” He knocked his head on the pillow. “Save me, reverend sir!” he cried when the priest was brought in, seizing hold of him.\n\n“Your illness is not one that any medicine can cure,” said the Taoist with a sigh. “I have a precious thing here, however, which you may look at every day and so preserve your life.”\n\nHe produced from his pouch a mirror polished on both sides and engraved with the inscription: Precious Mirror of Love. Handing it to Jia Rui he said:\n\n“This mirror comes from the Hall of the Illusory Spirit in the Land of Great Void. It was fashioned by the Goddess of Disenchantment to cure illnesses resulting from lustful desires or romantic longings. With its power to protect health and prolong life, I have brought it into the world for those intelligent, handsome and high-born young gentlemen to look into. But I must warn you: never look into the front. Only into the back. Remember that! Remember that! I shall come for it again in three days’ time, by when I guarantee you will be cured.” With that he walked away, and though they pleaded with him to stay they could not detain him.\n\nJia Rui reflected, “This Taoist seems to know what he’s about. Why not try his mirror?” He picked it up and looked into the back, as advised. A skeleton was staring out at him. In a flurry he covered it, swearing, “Confound the scoundrel! Fancy trying to scare me like that! Well, now let me look into the other side and see what that shows.”\n\nHe turned the mirror over and looked — and there was Xifeng beckoning to him. In raptures, he felt himself floating lightly into the mirror to join her in her sport. Then she saw him out and back to his bed. With a groan he opened his eyes and the mirror slipped from his hands, showing the back again with that skeleton. All in a sweat, he found that he had had an emission. But still not satisfied, he turned the mirror over again and there was Xifeng beckoning as before....\n\nHe went into the mirror three or four times until this time, just as he was leaving it, two men approached him, clamped an iron chain on him and started dragging him away. He cried, “Wait till I’ve taken the mirror with me!” But that was all he could say.\n\nThe attendants watching him saw the mirror drop from his hands and open-eyed he breathed his last. They hurried over to feel him and found that he was cold and there was no breath. Below the waist all was icy cold and sticky. They lost no time in shifting him to his bed and preparing for the funeral.\n\nHis grandparents were heart-broken and stormed at the Taoist, “What kind of black magic is this?” They ordered the mirror to be burned. But then they heard a cry from mid-air:\n\n“Who told him to look into the front? It is you who have confused the unreal with the real. Why burn my mirror?”\n\nThey saw the lame Taoist approaching to take the mirror.\n\n“I have come to get the Precious Mirror of Love,” he called, then snatched it and floated away.\n\nDai-ru could only see to the funeral. He sent to report the death in various quarters and three days later the funeral started. After seven days the coffin was taken to Iron Threshold Temple for temporary deposit, and all the Jia family came to offer condolences. Jia She of the Rong Mansion contributed twenty taels of silver and Jia Zheng did the same, as did Jia Zhen of the Ning Mansion. Other members of the clan gave from one to four taels according to their means. And the families of his school-fellows raised twenty or thirty taels between them. So although Dai-ru’s means were slender, with this help he was able to make a handsome funeral.\n\nThis matter was soon settled.\n\nBut towards the end of winter that year Lin Juhai fell seriously ill and wrote to beg that his daughter be sent home. The Lady Dowager was most distressed and could not but make haste to prepare for her granddaughter’s departure. Baoyu was very upset, yet he could hardly prevent her going to her own father. So the Lady Dowager decided to send Chia Lien to see her home and fetch her back again. Of the luggage and presents for different relatives on the way we need not speak in detail. Everything was of the best, naturally. A day was quickly chosen for their departure and Chia Lien took leave of the family. Then, attended by pages, he saw Tai-yu aboard a boat and they set sail for Yangchow.\n\nIf you want to know what happened, read the next chapter."
