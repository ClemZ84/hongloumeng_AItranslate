  "original": "话说凤姐听了小丫头的话，又气又急又伤心，不觉吐了一口血，便昏晕过去，坐在地下。平儿急来扶住，忙叫了人来搀扶着，慢慢的送到自己房中，将凤姐轻轻的安放在炕上，立刻叫小红斟上一杯开水送到凤姐唇边。凤姐呷了一口，昏迷仍睡。秋桐过来略瞧了一瞧，便走开了，平儿也不叫他。只见丰儿在旁站着，平儿便说：“快去回明二位太太。”于是丰儿将凤姐吐血不能照应的话回了邢、王二夫人。邢夫人打量凤姐推病藏躲，因这时女亲都在内里，也不好说别的，心里却不全信，只说：“叫他歇着去罢。”众人也并无言语。自然这晚亲友来往不绝，幸得几个内亲照应。家下人等见凤姐不在，也有偷闲歇力的，乱乱吵吵，已闹得七颠八倒，不成事体了。\n　　到二更多天，远客去后，便预备辞灵，孝幕内的女眷，大家哭了一阵。只见鸳鸯已哭的昏晕过去了，大家扶住，捶闹了一阵，才醒过来，便说“老太大疼了一场，要跟了去”的话。众人都打量人到悲哭，俱有这些言语，也不理会。及至辞灵的时候，上上下下也有百十馀人，只不见鸳鸯，众人因为忙乱，却也不曾检点。到琥珀等一干人哭奠之时，才要找鸳鸯，又恐是他哭乏了，暂在别处歇着，也不言语。\n　　辞灵以后，外头贾政叫了贾琏问明送殡的事，便商量着派人看家。贾琏回说：“上人里头，派了芸儿在家照应，不必送殡；下人里头，派了林之孝的一家子照应拆棚等事。但不知里头派谁看家？”贾政道：“听见你母亲说是你媳妇病了，不能去，就叫他在家的。你珍大嫂子又说你媳妇病得利害，还叫四丫头陪着，带领了几个丫头婆子，照看上屋里才好。”贾琏听了，心想：“珍大嫂子与四丫头两个不合，所以撺掇着不叫他去。若是上头就是他照应，也是不中用的。我们那一个又病着，也难照应。”想了一回，回贾政道：“老爷且歇歇儿，等进去商量定了再回。”贾政点了点头，贾琏便进去了。\n　　谁知此时鸳鸯哭了一场，想到：“自己跟着老太太一辈子，身子也没有着落。如今大老爷虽不在家，大太太的这样行为，我也瞧不上。老爷是不管事的人，以后便‘乱世为王’起来了，我们这些人不是要叫他们掇弄了么？谁收在屋子里，谁配小子，我是受不得这样折磨的，倒不如死了干净。但是一时怎么样的个死法呢？”一面想，一面走到老太太的套间屋内。刚跨进门，只见灯光惨淡，隐隐有个女人拿着汗巾子，好似要上吊的样子。鸳鸯也不惊怕，心里想道：“这一个是谁？和我的心事一样，倒比我走在头里了。”便问道：“你是谁？咱们两个人是一样的心，要死一块儿死。”那个人也不答言。鸳鸯走到跟前一看，并不是这屋子的丫头。仔细一看，觉得冷气侵入，一时就不见了。鸳鸯呆了一呆，退出在炕沿上坐下，细细一想，道：“哦！是了，这是东府里的小蓉大奶奶啊！他早死了的了，怎么到这里来？必是来叫我来了。他怎么又上吊呢？”想了一想，道：“是了，必是教给我死的法儿。”鸳鸯这么一想，邪侵入骨，便站起来，一面哭，一面开了妆匣，取出那年铰的一绺头发揣在怀里，就在身上解下一条汗巾，按着秦氏方才比的地方拴上。自己又哭了一回，听见外头人客散去，恐有人进来，急忙关上屋门。然后端了一个脚凳，自己站上，把汗巾拴上扣儿，套在咽喉，便把脚凳蹬开。可怜咽喉气绝，香魂出窍，正无投奔，只见秦氏隐隐在前，鸳鸯的魂魄疾忙赶上，说道：“蓉大奶奶，你等等我。”那个人道：“我并不是什么蓉大奶奶，乃警幻之妹可卿是也。”鸳鸯道：“你明明是蓉大奶奶，怎么说不是呢？”那人道：“这也有个缘故，待我告诉你，你自然明白了。我在警幻宫中，原是个钟情的首坐，管的是风情月债，降临尘世，自当为第一情人，引这些痴情怨女，早早归入情司，所以我该悬梁自尽的。因我看破凡情，超出情海，归入情天，所以太虚幻境‘痴情’一司，竟自无人掌管。今警幻仙子已经将你补入，替我掌管此司，所以命我来引你前去的。”鸳鸯的魂道：“我是个最无情的，怎么算我是个有情的人呢？”那人道：“你还不知道呢。世人都把那淫欲之事当作‘情’字，所以作出伤风败化的事来，还自谓风月多情，无关紧要。不知情之一字，喜怒哀乐未发之时，便是个‘性’；喜怒哀乐已发，便是‘情’了。至于你我这个情，正是未发之情，就如那花的含苞一样。若待发泄出来，这情就不为真情了。”鸳鸯的魂听了，点头会意，便跟了秦氏可卿而去。\n　　这里琥珀辞了灵，听邢、王二夫人分派看家的人，想着去问鸳鸯明日怎样坐车，便在贾母的那间屋里找了一遍。不见，又找到套间里头。刚到门口，见门儿掩着；从门缝里望里看时，只见灯光半明半灭的，影影绰绰。心里害怕，又不听见屋里有什么动静，便走回来说道：“这蹄子跑到那里去了？”劈头见了珍珠，说：“你见鸳鸯姐姐来着没有？”珍珠道：“我也找他，太太们等他说话呢。必在套间里睡着了罢？”琥珀道：“我瞧了，屋里没有。那灯也没人夹蜡花儿，漆黑怪怕的，我没进去。如今咱们一块儿进去，瞧看有没有。”琥珀等进去，正夹蜡花，珍珠说：“谁把脚凳撂在这里，几乎绊我一跌！”说着，往上一瞧，唬的“嗳哟”一声，身子往后一仰，“咕咚”的栽在琥珀身上。琥珀也看见了，便大嚷起来，只是两只脚挪不动。外头的人也都听见了，跑进来一瞧，大家嚷着，报与邢、王二夫人知道。\n　　王夫人、宝钗等听了，都哭着去瞧。邢夫人道：“我不料鸳鸯倒有这样志气！快叫人去告诉老爷。”只有宝玉听见此信，便唬的双眼直竖。袭人等慌忙扶着说道：“你要哭就哭，别憋着气。”宝玉死命的才哭出来了。心想：“鸳鸯这样一个人，偏又这样死法！”又想：“实在天地间的灵气，独钟在这些女子身上了。他算得了死所。我们究竟是一件浊物，还是老太太的儿孙，谁能赶得上他？”复又喜欢起来。那时，宝钗听见宝玉大哭了出来了，及到跟前，见他又笑。袭人等忙说：“不好了，又要疯了。”宝钗道：“不妨事，他有他的意思。”宝玉听了，更喜欢宝钗的话，“到底他还知道我的心，别人那里知道。”正在胡思乱想，贾政等进来，着实的嗟叹着说道：“好孩子，不枉老太太疼他一场！”即命贾琏：“出去吩咐人连夜买棺盛殓，明日便跟着老太太的殡送出，也停在老太太棺后，全了他的心志。”贾琏答应出去，这里命人将鸳鸯放下，停放里间屋内。\n　　平儿也知道了，过来同袭人、莺儿等一干人都哭的哀哀欲绝。内中紫鹃也想起自己终身，无着落，恨不跟了林姑娘去，又全了主仆的恩义，又得了死所。如今空悬在宝玉屋内，虽说宝玉仍是柔情密意，究竟算不得什么，于是更哭得哀切。\n　　王夫人即传了鸳鸯的嫂子进来，叫他看着入殓，遂与邢夫人商量了，在老太太项内赏了他嫂子一百两银子，还说等闲了将鸳鸯所有的东西俱赏他们。他嫂子磕了头出去，反喜欢说：“真真的我们姑娘是个有志气的有造化的！又得了好名声，又得了好发送。”傍边一个婆子说道：“罢呀嫂子，这会子你把一个活姑娘卖了一百银便这么喜欢了，那时候儿给了大老爷，你还不知得多少银钱呢，你该更得意了。”一句话戳了他嫂子的心，便红了脸走开了。刚走到二门上，见林之孝带了人抬进棺材来了，他只得也跟进去，帮着盛殓，假意哭嚎了几声。\n　　贾政因他为贾母而死，要了香来，上了三炷，作了个揖，说：“他是殉葬的人，不可作丫头论，你们小一辈的都该行个礼儿。”宝玉听了，喜不自胜，走来恭恭敬敬磕了几个头。贾琏想他素日的好处，也要上来行礼，被邢夫人说道：“有了一个爷们就是了，别折受的他不得超生。”贾琏就不便过来了。宝钗听着这话，好不自在，便说道：“我原不该给他行礼，但只老太太去世，咱们都有未了之事，不敢胡为。他肯替咱们尽孝，咱们也该托托他。好好的替咱们伏侍老太太西去，也少尽一点子心哪。”说着，扶了莺儿走到灵前，一面奠酒，那眼泪早扑簌簌流下来了。奠毕，拜了几拜，狠狠的哭了他一场。众人也有说宝玉的两口子都是傻子，也有说他两个心肠儿好的，也有说他知礼的，贾政反倒合了意。一面商量定了看家的，仍是凤姐、惜春，馀者都遣去伴灵。一夜谁敢安眠。一到五更，听见外面齐人。到了辰初发引，贾政居长，衰麻哭泣，极尽孝子之礼。灵柩出了门，便有各家的路祭，一路上的风光，不必细述。走了半日，来至铁槛寺安灵，所有孝男等俱应在庙伴宿，不提。\n　　且说家中林之孝带领拆了棚，将门窗上好，打扫净了院子，派了巡更的人，到晚打更上夜。只是荣府规例，一交二更，三门掩上，男人就进不去了，里头只有女人们查夜。凤姐虽隔了一夜，渐渐的神气清爽了些，只是那里动得。只有平儿同着惜春各处走了一走，吩咐了上夜的人，也便各自归房。\n　　却说周瑞的干儿子何三，去年贾珍管事之时，因他和鲍二打架，被贾珍打了一顿，撵在外头，终日在赌场过日。近知贾母死了，必有些事情领办，岂知探了几天的信，一些也没有想头，便嗳声叹气的回到堵场中，闷闷的坐下。那些人便说道：“老三，你怎么不下来捞本儿了吗？”何三道：“倒想要捞一捞呢，就只没有钱么。”那些人道：“你到你们周大太爷那里去了几日，府里的钱，你也不知弄了多少来，又来和我们装穷儿了。”何三道：“你们还说呢。他们的金银不知有几百万，只藏着不用。明儿留着，不是火烧了，就是贼偷了，他们才死心呢。”那些人道：“你又撒谎。\n他家抄了家，还有多少金银？”何三道：“你们还不知道呢。抄的是撂不了的。如今老太太死后，还留了好些金银，他们一个也不使，都在老太太屋里搁着，等送了殡回来才分呢。”内中有一个人听在心里，掷了几骰，便说：“我输了几个钱也不翻本儿了，睡去了。”说着，便走出来，拉了何三道：“老三，我和你说句话。”何三跟他出来。那人道：“你这么个伶俐人，这么穷，我替你不服这口气。”何三道：“我命里穷，可有什么法儿呢？”那人道：“你才说荣府的银子这么多，为什么不去拿些使唤使唤？”何三道：“我的哥哥，他家的金银虽多，你我去白要一二钱，他们给咱们吗？”那人笑道：“他不给咱们，咱们就不会拿吗？”\n　　 何三听了这话里有话，忙问道：“依你说，怎么样拿呢？”那人道：“我说你没有本事，若是我，早拿了来了。”何三道：“你有什么本事？”那人便轻轻的说道：“你若要发财，你就引个头儿。我有好些朋友，都是通天的本事。别说他们送殡去了，家里只剩下几个女人，就让有多少男人也不怕。只怕你没这么大胆子罢咧。”何三道：“什么敢不敢，你打量我怕那个干老子吗！我是瞧着干妈的情儿上头，才认他做干老子罢咧，他又算了人了。你刚才的话，就只怕弄不来，倒招了饥荒。他们那个衙门不熟？别说拿不来，倘或拿了来，也要闹出来的。”那人道：“这么说，你的运气来了。我的朋友还有海边上的呢，现今都在这里。看个风头，等个门路，若到了手，你我在这里也无益，不如大家下海去受用，不好么？你若撂不下你干妈，咱们索性把你干妈也带了去，大家伙儿乐一乐，好不好？”何三道：“老大，你别是醉了罢？这些话混说的是什么。”说着，拉了那人走到个僻静地方，两个人商量了一回，各人分头而去，暂且不提。\n　　且说包勇自被贾政吆喝，派去看园，贾母的事出来，也忙了，不曾派他差使。他也不理会，总是自做自吃，闷来睡一觉，醒时便在园里耍刀弄棍，倒也无拘无束。那日贾母一早出殡，他虽知道，因没有派他差使，他任意闲游。只见一个女尼带了一个道婆，来到园内腰门那里扣门。包勇走来，说道：“女师父那里去？”道婆道：“今日听得老太太的事完了，不见四姑娘送殡，想必是在家看家。恐他寂寞，我们师父来瞧他一瞧。”包勇道：“主子都不在家，园门是我看的，请你们回去罢。要来呢，等主子们回来了再来。”婆子道：“你是那里来的个黑炭头，也要管起我们的走动来了。”包勇道：“我嫌你们这些人，我不叫你们来，你们有什么法儿？”婆子生了气，嚷道：“这都是反了天的事了，连老太太在日还不能拦我们的来往走动呢。你是那里的这么个横强盗，这样没法没天的？我偏要打这里走！”说着，便把手在门环上狠狠的打了几下。妙玉已气的不言语，正要回身便走，不料里头看二门的婆子听见有人拌嘴，连忙开门一看，见是妙玉，已经回身走去，明知必是包勇得罪了走了。近日婆子们都知道，上头太太们、四姑娘都和他亲近，恐他日后说出门上不放进他来，那时如何耽得住，赶忙走来，说：“不知师父来，我们开门迟了。我们四姑娘在家里，还正想师父呢。快请回来。看园的小子是个新来的，他不知咱们的事。回来回了太太，打他一顿，撵出去就完了。”妙玉虽是听见，总不理他。那禁得看腰门的婆子赶上，再四央求，后来才说出怕自己担不是，几乎急的跪下。妙玉无奈，只得随着那婆子过来。包勇见这般光景，自然不好再拦，气得瞪眼叹气而回。\n　　这里妙玉带了道婆走到惜春那里，道了恼，叙些闲话。惜春说起：“在家看家，只好熬个几夜，但是二奶奶病着，一个人又闷又害怕，能有一个人在这里我就放心，如今里头一个男人也没有。今儿你既光降，肯伴我一宵，咱们下棋说话儿，可使得么？”妙玉本来不肯，见惜春可怜，又提起下棋，一时高兴应了。打发道婆回去取了他的茶具衣褥，命侍儿送了过来，大家坐谈一夜。惜春欣幸异常，便命彩屏去开上年蠲的雨水，预备好茶。那妙玉自有茶具。道婆去了不多一时，又来了一个侍者，送下妙玉日用之物。惜春亲自烹茶。两人言语投机，说了半天。那时天有初更时候，彩屏放下棋枰，两人对弈。惜春连输两盘，妙玉又让了四个子儿，惜春方赢了半子。不觉已到四更，正是天空地阔，万籁无声。妙玉道：“我到五更须得打坐，我自有人伏侍，你自去歇息。”惜春犹是不舍，见妙玉要自己养神，不便扭他。\n　　刚要歇去，猛听得东边上屋内上夜的人一片声喊起。惜春那里的老婆子们也接着声嚷道：“了不得了！有了人了！”唬得惜春、彩屏等心胆俱裂，听见外头上夜的男人便声喊起来。妙玉道：“不好了，必是这里有了贼了。”说着赶忙的关上屋门。便掩了灯光，在窗户眼内往外一瞧，只见几个男人站在院内。唬得不敢作声，回身摆着手，轻轻的爬下来，说：“了不得！外头有几个大汉站着。”说犹未了，又听得房上响声不绝，便有外头上夜的人进来吆喝拿贼。一个人说道：“上屋里的东西都丢了，并不见人。东边有人去了，咱们到西边去。”惜春的老婆子听见有自己的人，便在外间屋里说道：“这里有好些人上了房了。”上夜的都道：“你瞧，这可不是吗！”大家一齐嚷起来。只听房上飞下好些瓦来，众人都不敢上前。\n　　正在没法，只听园里腰门一声大响，打进门来。见一个梢长大汉，手执木棍，众人唬得藏躲不及。听得那人喊说道：“不要跑了他们一个！你们都跟我来！”这些家人听了这话，越发唬得骨软筋酥，连跑也跑不动了。只见这人站在当地，只管乱喊。家人中有一个眼尖些的看出来了，你道是谁，正是甄家荐来的包勇。这些家人不觉胆壮起来，便颤巍巍的说道：“有一个走了，有的在房上呢。”包勇便向地下一扑，耸身上房，追赶那贼。这些贼人明知贾家无人，先在院内偷看惜春房内，见有个绝色尼姑，便顿起淫心。又欺上屋俱是女人，且又畏惧，正要踹进门去，因听外面有人进来追赶，所以贼众上房。见人不多，还想抵挡，猛见一人上房赶来，那些贼见是一人，越发不理论了，便用短兵抵住。那经得包勇用力一棍打去，将贼打下房来。那些贼飞奔而逃，从园墙过去。包勇也在房上追捕。岂知园内早藏下了几个在那里接赃，已经接过好些。见贼伙跑回，大家举械保护。见追的只有一人，明欺寡不敌众，反倒迎上来。包勇一见生气，道：“这些毛贼，敢来和我斗斗！”那伙贼便说：“我们有一个伙计被他们打倒了，不知死活，咱们索性抢了他出来。”这里包勇闻声即打。那伙贼便轮起器械，四五个人围住包勇，乱打起来。外头上夜的人也都仗着胆子只顾赶了来。众贼见斗他不过，只得跑了。包勇还要赶时，被一个箱子一绊，立定看时，心想东西未丢，众贼远逃，也不追赶，便叫众人将灯照看。地下只有几个空箱，叫人收拾，他便欲跑回上房。因路径不熟，走到凤姐那边，见里面灯烛辉煌，便问：“这里有贼没有？”里头的平儿战兢兢的说道：“这里也没开门，只听上屋叫喊，说有贼呢，你到那里去罢。”包勇正摸不着路头，遥见上夜的人过来，才跟着一齐寻到上屋。见是门开户启，那些上夜的在那里啼哭。\n　　一时贾芸林之孝都进来了，见是失盗，大家着急。进内查点，老太太的房门大开，将灯一照，锁头拧折。进内一瞧，箱柜已开。便骂那些上夜女人道：“你们都是死人么？贼人进来，你们都不知道么？”那些上夜的人啼哭着说道：“我们几个人轮更上夜，是管二三更的。我们都没有住脚，前后走的。他们是四更五更。我们才下班儿，只听见他们喊起来，并不见一个人。赶着照看，不知什么时候把东西早已丢了。求爷们问管四更五更的。”林之孝道：“你们个个要死！回来再说，咱们先到各处看去。”上夜的男人领着走到尤氏那边，门儿关紧。有几个接音说：“唬死我们了！”林之孝问道：“这里没有丢东西呀？”里头的人方开了门，道：“这里没丢东西。”林之孝带着人走到惜春院内，只听得里面说道：“了不得，唬死了姑娘了。醒醒儿罢！”林之孝便叫人开门，问是怎么了。里头婆子开门，说：“贼在这里打仗，把姑娘都唬坏了。亏得妙师父和彩屏才将姑娘救醒。东西是没失。”林之孝道：“贼人怎么打仗？”上夜的男人说：“幸亏包大爷上了房把贼打跑了去了，还听见打倒了一个人呢。”包勇道：“在园门那里呢，你们快瞧去罢。”贾芸等走到那边，果然看见一个人躺在地下死了，细细的一瞧，好象是周瑞的干儿子。众人见了诧异，派了一个人看守着，又派了两个人照看前后门。走到门前看时，那门俱仍旧关锁着。林之孝便叫人开了门，报了营官。立刻到来查勘贼踪，是从后夹道子上了房的，到了西院房上，见那瓦片破碎不堪，一直过了后园去了。众上夜的人齐声说道：“这不是贼，是强盗。”营官着急道：“并非明火执仗，怎么便算是强盗呢？”上夜的道：“我们赶贼，他在房上撇瓦，我们不能到他跟前，幸亏我们家的姓包的上房打退。赶到园里，还有好几个贼竟和姓包的打起仗来，打不过姓包的，才都跑了。”营官道：“可又来，若是强盗，难道倒打不过你们的人么？不用说了，你们快查清了东西，递了失单，我们报就是了。”贾芸等又到了上屋里，已见凤姐扶病过来，惜春也来了。贾芸请了凤姐的安，问了惜春的好，大家查看失物。因鸳鸯已死，琥珀等又送灵去了，那些东西都是老太太的，并没见过数儿，只用封锁，如今打从那里查起？众人都说：“箱柜东西不少，如今一空，偷的时候儿自然不小了。那些上夜的人管做什么的？况且打死的贼是周瑞的干儿子，必是他们通同一气的。”凤姐听了，气的眼睛直瞪瞪的，便说：“把那些上夜的女人都拴起来，交给营里去审问！”众人叫苦连天，跪地哀求。\n不知怎生发放，并失去的物件有无着落，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After hearing the young maid’s report, Xifeng was overcome by rage, chagrin and grief. She spat out a mouthful of blood and fainted, collapsing to the ground. Pinger hurried over to support her and summoned help to carry her slowly back to her own room. They laid her gently on the kang, and Pinger told Xiaohong to pour a cup of boiled water and hold it to her lips. Xifeng sipped a little, then lost consciousness again and dozed off.\n\nWhen Qiutong came to have a look at her, Pinger did not ask her to stay; and after a brief glance Qiutong went away. Fenger was standing by, and Pinger told her, “Go and report this at once to Their Ladyships.” So Fenger informed Lady Xing and Lady Wang that Xifeng had brought up blood and was unable to carry on.\n\nLady Xing suspected that Xifeng was feigning illness to get out of her duties. However, as there were women relatives present she could not voice her doubts and simply said, “Tell her to rest.” No one else made any comment. Naturally, the stream of relatives and friends calling that evening was endless, and luckily there were some female relatives to help entertain them. The servants, because Xifeng was not there to supervise them, slacked and made such a commotion that everything was at sixes and sevens.\n\nAfter the second watch, when the more distant relatives had left, they prepared to bid farewell to the dead. The women in the mourning tent all wept together, Yuanyang crying until she fainted. The others supported her and pummelled her until she came round. She said that the old lady had been so good to her she wanted to follow her to the grave. The rest, assuming that she was simply distraught, paid no attention. When the time came for the ceremony of leave-taking, more than a hundred people — high and low — were present but no one noticed Yuanyang’s absence, as all was bustle and confusion. Not until Hu-po and the other maids came to mourn did they look for her. They thought she must have tired herself out by weeping and be resting somewhere, so they said nothing.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Jia Zheng outside sent for Jia Lian to ask about the funeral procession and discuss whom to leave in charge of the house.\n\nJia Lian replied, “Of the masters, I’ve assigned Yun to look after things here — he needn’t join the procession. Of the servants, I’ve put Lin Zhixiao and his wife in charge of taking down the marquees and so on. But I don’t know who’s to be in charge inside.”\n\n“I heard from your mother that your wife is ill and can’t go, so she’ll be staying at home,” said Jia Zheng. “But your sister-in-law Zhen says she’s seriously ill, and suggests that Xichun should keep her company with some maids and nurses to look after the inner apartments.”\n\nJia Lian thought, “Xichun and Xifeng don’t get on; that’s why she’s proposing that Xichun should stay. But even if Xichun’s put in charge, she’s no use. And my wife’s too ill to manage anything either.” After reflection he answered, “Don’t worry, sir. Let me go in and discuss it, then report back.”\n\nJia Zheng nodded and Jia Lian withdrew.\n\nNow Yuanyang, after weeping, had reflected, “I’ve served the old lady all my life, but now I’ve no one to depend on. Though the Elder Master isn’t at home, the way the Elder Mistress is carrying on disgusts me. The master takes no charge of household affairs, and now that we’re in this ‘time of troubles’ we shall be at the mercy of these people. Whichever of them takes me into his household and gives me to one of his boys, I won’t be able to stand such torment. Better kill myself and have done with it. But how should I do it?”\n\nAs she was thinking she entered the old lady’s inner room. The lamplight was flickering there, and she seemed to see a woman with a scarf in her hand, as if about to hang herself. Yuanyang was not afraid but thought, “Who is she? She has the same idea as me, and has got here first!”\n\n“Who are you?” she asked. “If we’re of the same mind, let’s die together.”\n\nShe made no reply. Yuanyang went closer and saw that it was not one of their maids. Looking more carefully, she felt a sudden chill and the figure vanished. In bewilderment she withdrew and sat down on the edge of the kang to think.\n\n“Oh, I know!” she exclaimed. “It was Madam Rong of the East Mansion. But she died long ago, so how could she come here? She must have come to fetch me. Why was she hanging from a beam?” She thought a little longer. “Of course! She was showing me how to hang myself.”\n\nThis macabre fancy preyed on her mind. She stood up and, weeping, opened her dressing-case. She took out the lock of hair which she had cut off that year and tucked it inside her clothes. Then she untied her girdle and fastened it to a beam in the same place where Keqing had indicated. After weeping a while again, hearing that the visitors outside had left and afraid that someone might come in, she hastily closed the door. Then she placed a foot-stool under the beam, stood on it, fastened the noose around her neck and kicked the stool away.\n\nAlas! The breath was strangled out of her and her fragrant soul fled. But, having nowhere to go, it saw Keqing dimly in front and hurried after her.\n\n“Wait for me, Madam Rong!” it called.\n\n“I am not Madam Rong but the sister of the Goddess of Disenchantment, Keqing,” was the answer.\n\n“But you look exactly like Madam Rong. Why do you deny it?”\n\n“There is a reason for that. When I tell you, you will understand. In the palace of the Goddess of Disenchantment I was in charge of romantic affairs, and when I descended to the world of men I was bound to be the foremost ‘romantic’ to lead all lovelorn maidens at an early date back to the Department of Romance. That was why I had to hang myself. Because I saw through worldly romance, rose above the sea of love and returned to the paradise of love, the Department of Fond Infatuation in the Illusory Land of Great Void has been left unheaded. Now the goddess has chosen you to take my place there as the controller of that department, and that is why I was sent to fetch you.”\n\n“But I’m the most unromantic of all,” protested Yuanyang’s spirit. “How can you call me a romantic?”\n\n“You don’t understand,” was the reply. “All mortals mistaken lust for love. That is why they behave so immorally, yet consider themselves romantics and think that is of no consequence. They don’t realize that love in its undeveloped state is simply nature, whereas when developed it becomes emotion. As for the love which you and I have, this is undeveloped love — like a flower in bud. Once it blossoms, it is no longer true love.”\n\nYuanyang’s spirit nodded in comprehension and followed Keqing.\n\nMeanwhile, after leaving the sacrificial ceremony, Hu-po was told by Lady Xing and Lady Wang to see which of the maids were keeping watch. She thought she would ask Yuanyang how the carriages were to be arranged the next day, and looked for her first in the Lady Dowager’s room. Not finding her there, she went to the inner room. The door was closed but, peeping through the crack, she saw that the lamp was flickering and the room rather dark. She was afraid and, hearing no sound, turned back.\n\n“Where has that wench gone?” she wondered.\n\nShe ran into Pearl who asked, “Have you seen Sister Yuanyang? Their Ladyships want her.”\n\n“I’ve been looking for her too. Maybe she’s fallen asleep in the inner room.”\n\n“I looked, but she’s not there. And the lamp is so dim it’s scary, so I didn’t go in. Let’s go together to see if she’s there.”\n\nThey went in and were trimming the lamp when Pearl exclaimed, “Who put this foot-stool here? I nearly tripped over it!” She looked up and let out a cry of dismay.\n\nShe threw her head back and collapsed on top of Hu-po, who had seen it too and now set up a great cry, though she was too paralysed to move. The other maids outside heard her and came running in. When they saw what had happened, they too began calling out and ran to tell Lady Xing and Lady Wang.\n\nLady Wang and Bao-chai went at once to see for themselves and broke into loud lamentation.\n\n‘I never thought Faithful had it in her!’ exclaimed Lady Xing. ‘Tell Sir Zheng immediately.’\n\nWhen Bao-yu heard the news, he stared ahead of him in horror. Aroma and the others hurried to his side and supported him.\n\n‘Cry if you want to,’ said Aroma. ‘Don’t keep it all pent up inside.’\n\nAfter a tremendous effort, Bao-yu finally burst into tears.\n\n‘That Faithful of all people should have to die like this!’ he thought to himself. Then he continued his train of thought: ‘It is true then: the pure essence of humanity is a gift bestowed by Heaven on the female of the species. She has achieved a noble death. We males are a breed befouled, and Grandmother’s own sons and grandsons not excepted. None of us is worthy to compare with her.’\n\nThis reflection actually gave him a certain pleasure. When Bao-chai heard Bao-yu’s loud weeping and came over to him, she saw a smile on his face.\n\n‘Oh no!’ cried Aroma. ‘He’s going crazy again!’\n\n‘It’s all right,’ said Bao-chai. ‘He has his own reasons.’\n\nBao-yu was even more pleased to hear her say this.\n\n‘She at least understands me. No one else does.’\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Jia Zheng and the other men, who came in and expressed their profound admiration:\n\n‘What a noble child! She was worthy of Lady Jia’s love.’\n\nJia Zheng instructed Jia Lian: ‘See that a coffin is purchased this very night and that she is laid in it. Tomorrow her coffin will follow Lady Jia’s in the procession, and will be placed behind Hers, in fulfilment of her wish.’\n\nJia Lian assented and went to carry out his instructions. Some of the servants were told to lift Faithful down and lay her in one of the inner rooms.\n\nPatience heard the news and came over. She, Aroma and Oriole wept heartbrokenly. Nightingale was also among the mourners, and the event set her thinking of her own future, which was still so uncertain. She wished she could have followed her mistress; that would have been a worthy death, a true fulfilment of the bond between mistress and maid. As it was, she was living on with Bao-yu, and although he was as kind and loving as ever, she could see no purpose in her life, and wept more bitterly than any of them.\n\nLady Wang sent for Faithful’s sister-in-law and told her to supervise the laying- out. She and Lady Xing agreed that, as Faithful had been one of Lady Jia’s maids, they would give her sister-in-law a hundred taels from Lady Jia’s funds; and they promised that later on they would give her all Faithful’s possessions as well. The woman kowtowed and left, quite elated by this turn of events.\n\n‘That’s my sister-in-law for you! A girl of spirit, and born under a lucky star! She’s won herself a fine reputation, and a fine send-off into the bargain!’\n\n‘Huh!’ one of the older servants commented drily. ‘You sold a live sister-in-law for a hundred taels, and you’re happy enough with that. If you’d sold her to the Master, you’d have had a great deal more. You should be feeling pleased with yourself!’\n\nThis sarcastic remark touched the sister-in-law on the raw and she went off in some embarrassment. She had just reached the inner gate when she saw Lin Zhi-xiao coming in with some servants carrying the coffin. She had to go back with them and help with the laying-out, putting on a show of wailing and weeping for the occasion.\n\nJia Zheng reflected that Faithful had demonstrated her loyalty to Lady Jia by taking her own life. He lit three sticks of incense and made a bow before her, saying:\n\n‘As she has proved her devotion in this manner, she should not be thought of as a mere maid. All you younger members of the family should pay your respects to her.’\n\nBao-yu had been longing for just such a gesture. He came forward promptly and kowtowed several times, most reverently. Jia Lian, remembering what a good servant Faithful had always been, also came forward to make his bow, but Lady Xing intervened:\n\n‘As one of the gentlemen has already paid his respects, that should suffice. We don’t want to burden her with excessive honour and impede her progress in the after world.’\n\nJia Lian desisted. Bao-chai found this reasoning most distasteful.\n\n‘Although strictly speaking I should not be paying my respects to her,’ she thought to herself, ‘with Grandmother dead there are still matters awaiting our attention, and we must not act rashly. But as she has been brave enough to do this for us, the least we can do is show our respect...’\n\n\"You must ask him to do his best for us in looking after the Lady Dowager on her journey to the west, to show his own good heart.\" With that she helped Yinger to the bier and poured a libation, tears streaming down her cheeks. After this she bowed several times and wept bitterly.\n\nSome people commented that Baoyu and his wife were a foolish couple, others that they were good-hearted, others that they knew the proprieties. Jia Zheng for his part was pleased by their action.\n\nIt was decided that Xifeng and Xichun should stay behind to look after the house, while all the other ladies went to accompany the coffin. None of them dared sleep that night. At the fifth watch they heard the men mustering outside, and an hour later the funeral procession started, Jia Zheng as the chief mourner in hempen clothes walking behind the coffin and weeping, comporting himself like a perfect son. Once the coffin was carried out, different families along the way had set up sacrificial offerings, but there is no need to describe all the pomp of the procession. At noon they reached the Iron Threshold Temple where the coffin was deposited, and all the men in mourning were to keep vigil in the temple. But no more of this.\n\nBack in the Rong Mansion, Lin Zhixiao had the mourning sheds dismantled, the doors and windows fixed in place, the courtyard swept clean, and watchmen appointed to sound the watches during the night. According to the rules of the Rong Mansion, after the second watch the inner gate was closed and no man was allowed inside, only women making their rounds. Though Xifeng after a night's rest felt slightly better, she was still unable to move about. So Pinger and Xichun made a tour of inspection, warned the women on night duty to be careful, and then went back to their own rooms.\n\nNow He San, the adopted son of Zhou Rui, had the year before when Jia Zhen was in charge of the household been given a beating by him for fighting with Bao Er and driven out. Since then he had spent all his time in gambling dens. Having recently heard of the Lady Dowager's death, he was sure there would be some jobs going and waited for several days to be sent for, but no message came. Sighing, he went back to the gambling den and sat down dejectedly.\n\nThe others there asked, \"Well, Third Brother, aren't you going to try to win back your losses?\"\n\n\"I'd like to, but I've no money,\" he said.\n\n\"You were with your worthy adopted father Mr. Zhou for several days. The mansion's money must have passed through your hands — don't tell us you didn't keep some for yourself. Why pretend to be hard up?\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me about them!\" he snorted. \"They have I don't know how many millions of taels of gold and silver, but they keep it under wraps instead of spending it. They won't be content till it's burned or stolen!\"\n\n\"You're lying again. After their property was confiscated, how much can they have left?\"\n\n\"You don't know,\" he retorted. \"They couldn't confiscate everything. And now that the old lady's dead, she's left piles of gold and silver — they're not using any of it, but have stored it all in her place and won't share it out till after the funeral.\"\n\nOne of the men, hearing this, after throwing the dice a few more times said, \"I've lost a few cash, but I'm not going to try to win them back. I'm turning in.\" With that he went out, pulling He San after him. \"I want a word with you, Third Brother,\" he said.\n\nHe San followed him out.\n\n\"A smart fellow like you, so hard up — it makes me mad,\" said the other.\n\n\"It's my fate to be poor. What can I do about it?\"\n\n\"You just said the Rong Mansion has so much silver, why don't you help yourself to some?\"\n\n\"Brother, even if they have plenty of gold and silver, if you or I asked for an ounce or two, would they give it to us?\"\n\n\"If they won't give it, can't we take it?\"\n\nHe San caught his meaning and asked quickly, \"How would you set about it?\"\n\n\"You've no guts, that's your trouble. If I had, I'd have got it long ago.\"\n\n\"How would you go about it?\"\n\nThen the other said softly, \"If you want to make a fortune\n\nThen you make a start. I’ve plenty of friends with tremendous influence. Don’t talk of their having just a few women at home now that the men have gone to the funeral; I’m not afraid even if there are scores of men there. The only thing is, you may not have the nerve.”\n\n“What do you mean, nerve?” retorted He San. “Do you think I’m scared of that godfather of mine? It was only for my godmother’s sake that I acknowledged him — he doesn’t count as a man. But the way you talk, I’m afraid if we bungle the job we’ll land ourselves in trouble. They’re hand in glove with every yamen. Even if we pull it off, word may get out.”\n\n“In that case, this is your lucky day. Some of my friends are from the coast, and they’re all here now. We’ll watch for a chance and find some way to get it. Once it comes off, there’s no point in our staying on here; we may as well go off to the coast to enjoy ourselves. What do you say? If you can’t bear to part with your godmother, we’ll take her along too for some fun. How about that?”\n\n“Brother, you must be drunk, shooting off your mouth like that,” said He San.\n\nTaking the other aside to a quiet spot, they put their heads together for a while before going their different ways. But no more of this.\n\nSince Jia Zheng had ordered Bao Yong to look after the Garden, the old lady’s death had kept everyone so busy that he had been given no assignments. However, this did not worry him. He just fended for himself, sleeping when he felt bored and practising with sword or staff in the Garden when he woke, a free and easy life. The day of the Lady Dowager’s funeral, knowing that no duties had been assigned to him, he strolled about at random. He saw a nun and an old abbess knocking at the side gate of the Garden.\n\nBao Yong went over to ask, “Where are you from, reverend sisters?”\n\n“Today we heard that the old lady’s funeral was over,” said the abbess. “We didn’t see the fourth young lady at it, so assumed she must be keeping house and thought she might be lonely. That’s why my mistress has come to see her.”\n\n“None of the masters are at home,” said Bao Yong. “I’m in charge of the Garden gate, so I must ask you to go back. You can come again when the masters return.”\n\n“Who do you think you are, you black ruffian?” the abbess snapped. “How dare you stop us coming and going?”\n\n“I don’t like the look of you,” he retorted. “If I say you can’t come in, what can you do about it?”\n\nFurious, she cried, “This is rebellion! Even when the old lady was alive, no one stopped us coming and going. Who are you, you lawless bandit? I’m going in this way all the same!” She pounded hard several times on the knocker.\n\nMiaoyu, too angry to speak, was turning to leave when the old woman in charge of the inner gate, hearing the commotion, hurriedly opened the gate. Seeing that it was Miaoyu who was walking away, she knew that Bao Yong must have offended her. Recently all the servants had learned that the ladies of the house and Xichun were on good terms with her, and this woman was afraid that if Miaoyu complained that she had been refused admittance, she would be held responsible. She ran after her crying:\n\n“We didn’t know you were here, reverend sister. We were slow opening the gate. Our fourth young lady’s at home and was just thinking of you. Please come back! That new fellow who looks after the Garden doesn’t know the rules. When we report this to the mistress, he’ll be given a good beating and thrown out.”\n\nMiaoyu, though she heard, paid no attention and walked on until the old woman from the side gate caught up with her and pleaded hard with her, finally explaining that she was afraid of being blamed and nearly kneeling down to beg. Then Miaoyu had to go back with her. At sight of this, Bao Yong could not very well stop them again, but he stood staring after them indignantly and sighing.\n\nMiaoyu, followed by the abbess, went in. . . .\n\nThe old nun went to see Xichun, commiserated with her, and they chatted for a while.\n\n“I’m house-sitting,” said Xichun, “so of course I have to stay up for a few nights. But with Mrs. Lian ill, I feel both depressed and scared all alone here. I’d be fine if there was just one other person. But there isn’t a single man in the inner apartments. Since you’ve come, will you keep me company for the night? We can play draughts and chat.”\n\nMiaoyu would normally have refused, but she felt sorry for Xichun, and the mention of draughts tempted her to agree. She sent the old nun back to fetch her tea-things and bedding, telling a maid to bring them over. Then the two girls sat talking. Xichun, overjoyed, told Caiping to make good tea with the rain-water saved from the previous year. Miaoyu had her own tea-things. Soon after the old nun left, another serving-woman brought Miaoyu’s daily necessities. Xichun made tea herself. The two girls found each other so congenial that they chatted for a long time. At the first watch, Caiping set out the draught-board and they started to play. Xichun lost two games running; then after Miaoyu gave her a handicap of four pieces, she won by half a piece. Before they knew it, the fourth watch had sounded. The night was still, not a sound could be heard.\n\n“I have to sit in meditation at the fifth watch,” said Miaoyu. “My maid will help me. You can go to bed.”\n\nXichun was reluctant to leave her, but not wanting to disturb her meditation she was on the point of retiring when suddenly they heard cries from the night-watch in the eastern courtyard. The old women with Xichun took up the cry.\n\n“Help! There are thieves!”\n\nXichun and Caiping were scared out of their wits. They heard the men on night-duty outside shouting.\n\n“This is bad! There must be thieves here,” said Miaoyu.\n\nShe hastily closed the door, turned down the lamp and peeped through the window. Seeing several men in the courtyard, too frightened to make a sound she turned and signalled to the others, then softly climbed down.\n\n“There are big fellows out there,” she whispered.\n\nEven as she spoke, they heard a continuous tramping on the roof and the night-watch outside shouting to catch the thieves.\n\nOne man said, “The things in the main rooms are gone, but there’s no one there. Some have gone east. Let’s go west.”\n\nWhen Xichun’s old women heard that their own men were there, they called from the outer room, “Many men have climbed on our roof.”\n\nThe watchmen answered, “See? There they are!”\n\nAll started yelling together then. They heard many tiles fly down from the roof, but no one dared go forward.\n\nAt this juncture, with a great crash the side gate burst open and a tall stout fellow charged in brandishing a staff. The servants were too paralysed with fear to hide. They heard him bellow:\n\n“Don’t let a single one of them get away! Follow me!”\n\nThis made the servants shake in their shoes, too limp to run away. The man stood there bellowing, till one of the servants with sharp eyes recognized him. Who was it? Bao Yong, recommended by the Zhen family. At sight of him they took courage and quavered, “One thief has got away; the others are on the roof.”\n\nBao Yong plunged to the ground and bounded on to the roof to go after the thieves. These men, knowing that there were no men in the Jia mansion, had sneaked into the courtyard to peep into Xichun’s room. And the sight of this young nun so ravished them that they were bent on rape. Assuming that all the women in the other rooms would be easy to intimidate, they were on the point of breaking in when they heard men outside coming to catch them, and swarmed on to the roof. Seeing that there were not many men, they thought of putting up a fight; but at the sight of one man bounding after them they took him lightly and tried to fend him off with their short arms. However, Bao Yong lunged at them so fiercely with his staff that he\n\nThe thieves, scrambling down from the roof, fled helter-skelter by way of the garden wall, with Bao Yong in hot pursuit. They were met by several of their band who had been waiting in the garden to receive the stolen goods, and had already taken charge of several packages. Seeing their comrades in flight, they raised their cudgels to protect them and, as the pursuer was single-handed, thinking this gave them the advantage they charged him. This enraged Bao Yong.\n\n“You scoundrels!” he swore. “Just you try to fight me!”\n\n“One of our mates has been knocked down and we don’t know whether he’s dead or alive,” the thieves retorted. “We mean to rescue him.”\n\nAt that Bao Yong charged them. Four or five of them surrounded him and started laying on wildly. By now the watchmen outside had plucked up courage to join in the chase. The thieves, no match for them, took to their heels. When Bao Yong stumbled over a chest and stopped to look around, he decided that since nothing had been stolen and the thieves had fled he would not pursue them. He told the servants to bring a light and look around. A few empty chests were lying on the ground. Having ordered these to be put away, he headed back for the main house.\n\nNot knowing his way well, he went to Xifeng’s apartments. Seeing lights on inside, he called, “Are there any thieves in there?”\n\nPinger answered tremulously from inside, “We haven’t opened the door. We heard shouts from the main house that there were thieves. You’d better go there.”\n\nBao Yong, not knowing the way, saw some watchmen approaching in the distance and went with them to the main house. There the gate was wide open and the watchmen were sobbing.\n\nPresently Jia Yun and Lin Zhixiao arrived. Horrified to find that there had been a robbery, they went in to check up. The door of the Lady Dowager’s room was open, and when they shone a light on the lock they saw it had been forced. Inside, the chests and cupboards stood open.\n\n“Are you people dead?” they fumed at the women watchmen. “Couldn’t you hear the thieves breaking in?”\n\nThe women sobbed, “There were several of us on duty in turn, in charge from the second to the third watch; we never stopped patrolling the whole time. The watch from the fourth to the fifth had just taken over when we heard them shouting. But by the time we got a light and looked, the things had gone — we’ve no idea when. Please question the watch for the fourth and fifth periods, sir.”\n\n“You deserve to die, all of you!” swore Lin Zhixiao. “We’ll go into that later. First let’s make a check of the whole house.”\n\nThe men watchmen led the way to Madam You’s compound. The gate was closed, and voices from inside called, “We were scared to death!”\n\n“Was anything stolen here?” Lin Zhixiao asked.\n\nThen the gate was opened and they said, “Nothing was stolen.”\n\nLin Zhixiao and the others went on to Xichun’s court. They heard exclamations inside: “Help! The young lady’s scared to death. Do wake up!”\n\nLin Zhixiao ordered the gate opened and asked what had happened.\n\nAn old woman opened it and said, “The thieves had a fight here and scared our young lady out of her wits. Luckily, Sister Miao and Caiping brought her round. Nothing was stolen.”\n\n“How did the thieves come to fight?”\n\n“Luckily Mr. Bao went up on the roof and drove them away,” the watchmen answered. “We heard them knock down one man too.”\n\n“He’s there by the garden gate,” said Bao Yong. “Go and have a look, quick!”\n\nJia Yun and the rest went there and saw a man lying dead on the ground. A closer look showed that he appeared to be Zhou Rui’s adopted son. In surprise they detailed one man to keep watch there and two others to guard the front and back gates. Going to the main gate they found it still locked, so Lin Zhixiao had it opened and reported the robbery to the officer of the Peace Preservation Bureau, who came at once to investigate. They traced the thieves’ tracks to the back alley, from which they had climbed onto the roof. On the roof of the western court they found the tiles broken.\n\nThey went then to the back garden, and the night watchmen told them, “These weren’t ordinary thieves but bandits.”\n\n“They weren’t armed and didn’t put up a fight,” protested the officer. “How can you call them bandits?”\n\n“When we went after the thieves they threw tiles at us from the roof, so that we couldn’t get near them. Luckily one of your household, a man with the surname Bao, climbed up and drove them off. When they took to the garden, several of them fought him but were no match for him and ran away.”\n\n“There you are!” said the officer. “If they were bandits, how could they be no match for one of your men? That’s enough. Check what’s missing, make out a list of the stolen goods, and we’ll report it.”\n\nJia Yun and the others went to the main apartment, where Xifeng, ill as she was, had come with Xichun. Jia Yun paid his respects to Xifeng and inquired after Xichun. Then they checked the losses. Since Yuanyang had died and Hupo and the others had accompanied the old lady’s coffin, none of them knew the number of her things which had been kept under lock and key; so where were they to start?\n\n“There were a good many cases and chests,” they said, “and now they’re all empty. The thieves must have been at work for some time. What were the night watchmen up to? And one of the thieves killed was Zhou Rui’s godson — they must have been in league.”\n\nXifeng was so enraged by this, her eyes nearly started from her head.\n\n“Tie all the women on night duty up!” she fumed. “Hand them over to the yamen to be cross-examined!”\n\nThe servants in desperation pleaded piteously, kneeling down.\n\nTo know what action was taken and whether the stolen property was recovered or not, read the following chapter."
