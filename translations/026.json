  "original": "话说宝玉养过了三十三天之后，不但身体强壮，亦且连脸上疮痕平复，仍回大观园去。这也不在话下。\n　　且说近日宝玉病的时节，贾芸带着家下小厮坐更看守，尽夜在这里，那小红同众丫环也在这里守着宝玉。彼此相见日多，渐渐的混熟了。小红见贾芸手里拿着块绢子，倒象是自己从前掉的，待要问他，又不好问。不料那和尚道士来过，用不着一切男人，贾芸仍种树去了。这件事待放下又放不下，待要问去又怕人猜疑。正是犹豫不决、神魂不定之际，忽听窗外问道：“姐姐在屋里没有？”小红闻听，在窗眼内望外一看，原来是本院的个小丫头佳蕙，因答说：“在家里呢，你进来罢。”佳蕙听了跑进来，就坐在床上，笑道：“我好造化！才在院子里洗东西，宝玉叫往林姑娘那里送茶叶，花大姐姐交给我送去。可巧老太太给林姑娘送钱来，正分给他们的丫头们呢，见我去了，林姑娘就抓了两把给我。也不知是多少，你替我收着。”便把手绢子打开，把钱倒出来交给小红。小红就替他一五一十的数了收起。\n　　佳惠道：“你这两日心里到底觉着怎么样，依我说，你竟家去住两日，请一个大夫来瞧瞧，吃两剂药，就好了。”小红道：“那里的话？好好儿的，家去做什么？”佳蕙道：“我想起来了，林姑娘生的弱，时常他吃药，你就和他要些来吃，也是一样。”小红道：“胡说，药也是混吃的？”佳蕙道：“你这也不是个长法儿，又懒吃懒喝的，终久怎么样？”小红道：“怕什么，还不如早些死了倒于净。”佳蕙道：“好好儿的，怎么说这些话？”小红道：“你那里知道我心里的事！”佳蕙点头，想了一会道：“可也怨不得你。这个地方。本也难站。就象昨儿老太太因宝玉病了这些日子，说伏侍的人都辛苦了，如今身上好了，各处还香了愿，叫把跟着的人都按着等儿赏他们。我们算年纪小，上不去，我也不抱怨；象你怎么也不算在里头？我心里就不服。袭人那怕他得十分儿，也不恼他，原该的。说句良心话，谁还能比他呢？别说他素日殷勤小心，就是不殷勤小心，也拼不得。只可气睛雯、绮霞他们这几个都算在上等里去，仗着宝玉疼他们，众人就都捧着他们。你说可气不可气？”小红道：“也犯不着气他们。俗语说的：‘千里搭长棚，没有个不散的筵席。’谁守一辈子呢？不过三年五载，各人干各人的去了，那时谁还管谁呢！”这两句话不觉感动了佳蕙心肠，由不得眼圈儿红了，又不好意思无端的哭，只得勉强笑道：“你这话说的是。昨儿宝玉还说：明儿怎么收拾房子，怎么做衣裳。倒象有几百年熬煎似的。”\n　　小红听了，冷笑两声，方要说话，只见一个未留头的小丫头走进来，手里拿看些花样子并两张纸，说道：“这两个花样子叫你描出来呢。”说着，向小红撂下，回转身就跑了。小红向外问道：“到底是谁的？也等不的说完就跑。‘谁蒸下馒头等着你，怕冷了不成？’”那小丫头在窗外只说得一声：“是绮大姐姐的。”抬起脚来，咕咚咕咚又跑了。小红便赌气把那样子撂在一边，向抽屉内找笔。找了半天，都是秃的，因说道：“前儿一枝新笔放在那里了？怎么想不起来？”一面说，一面出神，想了一回，方笑道：“是了，前儿晚上莺儿拿了去了。”因向佳蕙道：“你替我取了来。”佳蕙道：“花大姐姐还等着我替他拿箱子，你自己取去罢。”小红道：“他等着你，你还坐着闲磕牙儿，我不叫你取去，他也不‘等’你了。坏透了的小蹄子！”\n　　说着自己便出房来。出了恰红院，一径往宝钗院内来，刚至沁芳亭畔，只见宝玉的奶娘李嬷嬷从那边来。小红立住，笑问道：“李奶奶，你老人家那里去了，怎么打这里来？”李嬷嬷站住，将手一拍，道：“你说，好好儿的，又看上了那个什么云哥儿雨哥儿的，这会子逼着我叫了他来。明儿叫上屋里听见，可又是不好。”小红笑道：“你老人家当真的就信着他去叫么？”李嬷嬷道：“可怎么样呢？”小红笑道：“那一个要是知好歹，就不进来才是。”李嬷嬷道：“他又不傻，为什么不进来？”小红道：“既是进来，你老人家该别和他一块儿来，回来叫他一个人混碰，看他怎么样！”李嬷嬷道：“我有那样大工夫和他走！不过告诉了他，回来打发个小丫头子或是老婆子，带进他来就完了。”说着拄着拐，一径去了。\n　　小红听说，便站着出神，且不去取笔。不多时，只见一个小丫头跑来，见小红站在那里，便问道：“红姐姐，你在这里作什么呢？”小红抬头见是小丫头子坠儿，小红道：“那里去？”坠儿道：“叫我带进芸二爷来。”说着，一径跑了。这里小红刚走至蜂腰桥门前，只见那边坠儿引着贾芸来了。那贾芸一面走，一面拿眼把小红一溜；那小红只装着和坠儿说话，也把眼去一溜贾芸：四目恰好相对。小红不觉把脸一红，一扭身往蘅芜院去了。不在活下。\n　　这里贾芸随着坠儿逶迤来至怡红院中，坠儿先进去回明了，然后方领贾芸进去。贾芸看时，只见院内略略有几点山石，种着芭蕉，那边有两只仙鹤，在松树下剔翎。一溜回廊上吊着各色笼子，笼着仙禽异鸟。上面小小五间抱厦，一色雕镂新鲜花样镉扇，上面悬着一个匾，四个大字，题道是：“怡红快绿”。贾芸想道：“怪道叫‘怡红院’，原来匾上是这四个字。”正想着，只听里面隔着纱窗子笑说道：“快进来罢，我怎么就忘了你两三个月！”贾芸听见是宝玉的声音，连忙进入房内，抬头一看，只见金碧辉煌，文章闪烁，却看不见宝玉在那里。一回头，只见左边立着一架大穿衣镜，从镜后转出两个一对儿十五六岁的丫头来，说：“请二爷里头屋里坐。”贾芸连正眼也不敢看，连忙答应了。\n　　又进一道碧纱厨，只见小小一张填漆床上，悬着大销金撤花帐子，宝玉穿着家常衣服，着鞋，倚在床上，拿着本书。看见他进来，将书掷下，早带笑立起身来。贾芸忙上前请了安，宝玉让坐，便在下面一张椅子上坐了。宝笑道：“只从那个月见了你，我叫你往书房里来，谁知接接连连许多事情，就把你忘了。”贾芸笑道：“总是我没造化，偏又遇着叔叔欠安。叔叔如今可大安了？”宝玉道：“大好了。我倒听见说你辛苦了好几天。”贾芸道：“辛苦也是该当的。叔叔大安了，也是我们一家子的造化。”说着，只见有个丫环端了茶来与他。那贾芸嘴里和宝玉说话，眼睛却瞅那丫环，细挑身子，容长脸儿，穿着银红袄儿，青缎子坎肩，白绫细褶儿裙子。那贾芸自从宝玉病了，他在里头混了两天，都把有名人口记了一半，他看见这丫环，知道是袭人。他在宝玉房中比别人不同，如今端了茶来，宝玉又在旁边坐着，便忙站起来笑道：“姐姐怎么给我倒起茶来？我来到叔叔这里，又不是客，等我自己倒罢了。”宝玉道：“你只管坐着罢。丫头们跟前也是这么着。”贾芸笑道：“虽那么说，叔叔屋里的姐姐们，我怎么敢放肆呢。”一面说，一面坐下吃茶。\n　　那宝玉便和他说些没要紧的散话，又说道谁家的戏子好，谁家的花园好，又告诉他谁家的丫头标致，谁家的酒席丰盛，又是谁家有奇货，又是谁家有异物。那贾芸口里只得顺着他说。说了一回，见宝玉有些懒懒的了，便起身告辞。宝玉也不甚留，只说：“你明儿闲了只管来。”仍命小丫头子坠儿送出去了。\n　　贾芸出了怡红院，见四顾无人，便慢慢的停着些走，口里一长一短和坠儿说话。先问他：“几岁了？名字叫什么？你父母在那行上？在宝叔屋里几年了？一个月多少钱？共总宝叔屋内有几个女孩子？”那坠儿见问，便一桩桩的都告诉他了。贾芸又道：“刚才那个和你说话的，他可是叫小红？”坠儿笑道：“他就叫小红。你问他作什么？”贾芸道：“方才他问你什么绢子，我倒拣了一块。”坠儿听了笑道：“他问了我好几遍，可有看见他的绢子的。我那里那么大工夫管这些事？今儿他又问我，他说我替他找着了还谢我呢。才在蘅芜院门口说的，二爷也听见了，不是我撤谎。好二爷，你既拣了，给我罢，我看他拿什么谢我。”原来上月贾芸进来种树之时，便拣了一块罗帕，知是这园内的人失落的，但不知是那一个人，故不敢造次。今听见小红问坠儿，知是他的，心内不胜喜幸。又见坠儿追索，心中早得了主意，便向袖内将自己的一块取出来，向坠儿笑道：“我给是给你，你要得了他的谢礼，可不许瞒着我。”坠儿满口里答应了，接了绢子，送出贾芸，回来找小红，不在话下。\n　　如今且说宝玉打发贾芸去后，意思懒懒的，歪在床上，似有朦胧之态。袭人便走上来，坐在床沿上推他，说道：“怎么又要睡觉？你闷的很，出去逛逛不好？”宝玉见说，携着他的手笑道：“我要去，只是舍不得你。”袭人笑道：“你没别的说了！”一面说，一面拉起他来。宝玉道：“可往那里去呢？怪腻腻烦烦的。”袭人道：“你出去了就好了，只管这么委琐，越发心里腻烦了。”宝玉无精打彩，只得依他。晃出了房门，在回廊上调弄了一回雀儿，出至院外，顺着沁芳溪，看了一回金鱼。只见那边山坡上两只小鹿儿箭也似的跑来。宝玉不解何意，正自纳闷，只见贾兰在后面，拿着一张小弓儿赶来。一见宝玉在前，便站住了，笑道：“二叔叔在家里呢，我只当出门去了呢。”宝玉道：“你又淘气了。好好儿的，射他做什么？”贾兰笑道：“这会子不念书，闲着做什么？所以演习演习骑射。”宝玉道：“磕了牙，那时候儿才不演呢。”\n　　说着，便顺脚一径来至一个院门前，看那凤尾森森，龙吟细细，正是潇湘馆。宝玉信步走人，只见湘帘垂地，悄无人声。走至窗前，觉得一缕幽香从碧纱窗中暗暗透出，宝玉便将脸贴在纱窗上看时，耳内忽听得细细的长叹了一声，道：“每日家情思睡昏昏！”宝玉听了，不觉心内痒将起来。再看时，只见黛玉在床上伸懒腰。宝玉在窗外笑道：“为什么‘每日家情思睡昏昏’的？”一面说，一面掀帘子进来了。黛玉自觉忘情，不觉红了脸，拿袖子遮了脸，翻身向里装睡着了。宝玉才走上来，要扳他的身子，只见黛玉的奶娘并两个婆子却跟进来了，说：“妹妹睡觉呢，等醒来再请罢。”刚说着，黛玉便翻身坐起来，笑道：“谁睡觉呢？”那两三个婆子见黛玉起来，便笑道：“我们只当姑娘睡着了。”说着，便叫紫鹃说：“姑娘醒了，进来伺候。”一面说，一面都去了。\n　　黛玉坐在床上，一面抬手整理鬓发，一面笑问宝玉道：“人家睡觉，你进来做什么？”宝玉见他星眼微饧，香腮带赤，不觉神魂早荡，一歪身坐在椅子上，笑道：“你才说什么？”黛玉道：“我没说什么。”宝玉笑道：“给你个榧子吃呢！我都听见了。”二人正说话，只见紫鹃进来，宝玉笑道：“紫鹃，把你们的好茶沏碗我喝。”紫鹃道：“我们那里有好的？要好的只好等袭人来。”黛玉道：“别理他。你先给我舀水去罢。”紫鹃道：“他是客，自然先沏了茶来再舀水去。”说着，倒茶去了。宝玉笑道：“好丫头！‘若共你多情小姐同鸳帐，怎舍得叫你叠被铺床？”黛玉登时急了，撂下脸来说道：“你说什么？”宝玉笑道：“我何尝说什么？”黛玉便哭道：“如今新兴的，外头听了村话来，也说给我听，看了混账书，也拿我取笑儿。我成了替爷们解闷儿的了。”一面哭，一面下床来，往外就走。宝玉心下慌了，忙赶上来说：“好妹妹，我一时该死．你好歹别告诉去！我再敢说这话，嘴上长个疔，烂了舌头。“\n　　正说着，只见袭人走来，说道：“快回去穿衣裳去罢，老爷叫你呢。”宝玉听了，不觉打了个焦雷一般，也顾不得别的，疾忙回来穿衣服。出园来，只见焙茗在二门前等着。宝玉问道：“你可知道老爷叫我是为什么？”焙茗道：“爷快出来罢，横竖是见去的，到那里就知道了。”一面说，一面催着宝玉。转过大厅，宝玉心里还自狐疑，只听墙角边一阵呵呵大笑，回头见薛蟠拍着手跳出来，笑道：“要不说姨夫叫你，你那里肯出来的这么快！”焙茗也笑着跪下了。宝玉怔了半天，方想过来是薛蟠哄出他来。薛蟠连忙打恭作揖赔不是，又求：“别难为了小子，都是我央及他去的。”宝玉也无法了，只好笑问道：“你哄我也罢了，怎么说是老爷呢？我告诉姨娘去，评评这个理，可使得么？”薛蟠忙道：“好兄弟，我原为求你快些出来，就忘了忌讳这句话，改日你要哄我，也说我父亲就完了。”宝玉道：“嗳哟，越发的该死了。”又向焙茗道：“反叛杂种，还跪着做什么？”焙茗连忙叩头起来。薛蟠道：“要不是，我也不敢惊动：只因明儿五月初三日，是我的生日，谁知老胡和老程他们，不知那里寻了来的，这么粗这么长粉脆的鲜藕，这么大的西瓜，这么长这么大的暹罗国进贡的灵柏香熏的暹罗猪、鱼。你说这四样礼物，可难得不难得？那鱼、猪不过贵而难得，这藕和瓜亏他怎么种出来的。我先孝敬了母亲，赶着就给你们老太太、姨母送了些去。如今留了些，我要自己吃恐怕折福，左思右想除我之外惟你还配吃，所以特请你来。可巧唱曲儿的一个小子又来了，我和你乐一天何如？”\n　　一面说，一面来到他书房里，只见詹光、程日兴、胡斯来、单聘仁等并唱曲儿的小子都在这里。见他进来，请安的，问好的，都彼此见过了。吃了茶，薛播即命人：“摆酒来。”话犹未了，众小厮七手八脚摆了半天，方才停当归坐。宝玉果见瓜藕新异，因笑道：“我的寿礼还没送来，倒先扰了。”薛蟠道：“可是呢，你明儿来拜寿，打算送什么新鲜物儿？”宝玉道：“我没有什么送的。若论银钱吃穿等类的东西，究竟还不是我的；惟有写一张字，或画一张画，这才是我的。”薛蟠笑道：“你提画儿，我才想起来了。昨儿我看见人家一本春宫儿，画的很好。上头还有许多的字，我也没细看，只看落的款，原来是什么‘庚黄’的。真好的了不得。”宝玉听说，心下猜疑道：“古今字画也都见过些，那里有个‘庚黄’？”想了半天，不觉笑将起来，命人取过笔来，在手心里写了两个字，又问薛蟠道：“你看真了是‘庚黄’么？”薛蟠道：“怎么没看真？”宝玉将手一撒给他看道：“可是这两个字罢？其实和‘庚黄’相去不远。”众人都看时，原来是“唐寅”两个字，都笑道：“想必是这两个字，大爷一时眼花了，也未可知。”薛蟠自觉没趣，笑道：“谁知他是‘糖银’是‘果银’的！”\n　　正说着，小厮来回：“冯大爷来了。”宝玉便知是神武将军冯唐之子冯紫英来了。薛蟠等一齐都叫“快请”。说犹未了，只见冯紫英一路说笑已进来了，众人忙起席让坐。冯紫英笑道：“好啊，也不出门了，在家里高乐罢。”宝玉、薛蟠都笑道：“一向少会。老世伯身上安好？”紫英答道：“家父倒也托庇康健。但近来家母偶着了些风寒，不好了两天。”薛蟠见他面上有些青伤，便笑道：“这脸上又和谁挥拳来，挂了幌子了？”冯紫英笑道：“从那一遭把仇都尉的儿子打伤了，我记了，再不怄气，如何又挥拳？这脸上是前日打围，在铁网山叫兔鹘梢了一翅膀。”宝玉道：“几时的话？”紫英道：“三月二十八日去的，前儿也就回来了。”宝玉道：“怪道前儿初三四儿我在沈世兄家赴席不见你呢！我要问，不知怎么忘了。单你去了，还是老世怕也去了？”紫英道：“可不是，家父去我没法儿，去罢了。难道我闲疯了，咱们几个人吃酒听唱的不乐，寻那个苦恼去？这一次，大不幸之中却有大幸。”\n　　薛蟠众人见他吃完了茶．都说道：“且入席，有话慢慢的说。”冯紫英听说，便立起身来说道：“论理，我该陪饮几杯才是，只是今儿有一件要紧的事，回去还要见家父面回，实不敢领。”薛蟠、宝玉众人那里肯依，死拉着不放。冯紫英笑道：“这又奇了。你我这些年，那一回有这个道理的？实在不能遵命。若必定叫我喝，拿大杯来，我领两杯就是了。”众人听说，只得罢了，薛蟠执壶，宝玉把盏，斟了两大海。那冯紫英站着，一气而尽。宝玉道：“你到底把这个‘不幸之幸’说完了再走。”冯紫英笑道：“今儿说的也不尽兴，我为这个，还要特治一个东儿，请你们去细谈一谈，二则还有奉恳之处。”说着撒手就走。薛蟠道：“越发说的人热刺刺的扔不下，多早晚才请我们？告诉了也省了人打闷雷。”冯紫英道：“多则十日，少则八天。”一面说，一面出门上马去了。众人回来，依席又饮了一回方散。\n　　宝玉回至园中，袭人正惦记他去见贾政，不知是祸是福，只见宝玉醉醺醺回来，因问其原故，宝玉一一向地说了。袭人道：“人家牵肠挂肚的等着，你且高乐去，也到底打发个人来给个信儿！”宝玉道：“我何尝不要送信儿，因冯世兄来了，就混忘了。”正说着，只见宝钗走进来，笑道：“偏了我们新鲜东西了。”宝玉笑道：“姐姐家的东西，自然先偏了我们了。”宝钗摇头笑道：“昨儿哥哥倒特特的请我吃，我不吃，我叫他留着送给别人罢。我知道我的命小福薄，不配吃那个。”说着，丫环倒了茶来，吃茶说闲话儿，不在话下。\n　　却说那黛玉听见贾政叫了宝玉去了，一日不回来，心中也替他忧虑。至晚饭后，闻得宝玉来了，心里要找他问问是怎么样了，一步步行来。见宝钗进宝玉的园内去了，自己也随后走了来。刚到了沁芳桥，只见各色水禽尽都在池中浴水，也认不出名色来，但见一个个文彩闪灼，好看异常，因而站住，看了一回。再往怡红院来，门已关了，黛玉即便叩门。谁知晴雯和碧痕二人正拌了嘴，没好气，忽见宝钗来了，那晴雯正把气移在宝钗身上，偷着在院内抱怨说：“有事没事跑了来坐着，叫我们三更半夜的不得睡觉！”忽听又有人叫门，晴雯越发动了气，也并不问是谁，便说道：“都睡下了，明儿再来罢！”\n　　黛玉素知丫头们的性情，他们彼此玩耍惯了，恐怕院内的丫头没听见是他的声音，只当别的丫头们了，所以不开门；因而又高声说道：“是我，还不开门么？”晴雯偏偏还没听见，便使性子说道：“凭你是谁，二爷吩咐的，一概不许放进人来呢！”黛玉听了这话，不觉气怔在门外。待要高声问他，逗起气来，自己又回思一番：“虽说是舅母家如同自己家一样，到底是客边。如今父母双亡，无依无靠，现在他家依栖，若是认真怄气，也觉没趣。”一面想，一面又滚下泪珠来了。真是回去不是，站着不是。正没主意，只听里面一阵笑语之声，细听一听，竟是宝玉、宝钗二人。黛玉心中越发动了气，左思右想，忽然想起早起的事来：“必意是宝玉恼我告他的原故。但只我何尝告你去了。你也不打听打听，就恼我到这步田地！你今儿不叫我进来，难道明儿就不见面了？”越想越觉伤感，便也不顾苍苔露冷，花径风寒，独立墙角边花阴之下，悲悲切切，呜咽起来。原来这黛玉秉绝代之姿容，具稀世之俊美，不期这一哭，把那些附近的柳枝花朵上宿鸟栖鸦，一闻此声，俱忒楞楞飞起远避，不忍再听。正是：\n　　花魂点点无情绪，鸟梦痴痴何处惊。\n　　因又有一首诗道：\n　　颦儿才貌世应稀，独抱幽芳出绣闺。\n　　呜咽一声犹未了，落花满地鸟惊飞。\n那黛玉正自啼哭，忽听吱喽喽一声，院门开处，不知是那一个出来。\n要知端的，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After thirty-three days of convalescence Baoyu, now strong and healthy again with all the sores on his face healed, went back to live in Grand View Garden. Of this no more need be said.\n\nDuring his illness Jia Yun had kept watch with pages and serving-men, taking it in turns to sit up at night. And Xiaohong together with some of the maids had also nursed him. As they saw each other every day, they gradually became better acquainted. Noticing that the handkerchief in Jia Yun’s hand looked like the one she had lost, Xiaohong wanted to ask him about it but felt embarrassed. Then the arrival of the monks and Taoists had made the presence of all men superfluous, and Jia Yun had gone back to his tree-planting. She could not get this matter out of her mind, yet was afraid of arousing suspicion if she questioned him. While she was still hesitating, someone called from outside the window:\n\n“Are you in, sister?”\n\nPeeping out, Xiaohong saw it was Jiahui, a young maid from the compound.\n\n“Yes, come in,” she answered.\n\nJiahui ran in and sat down on the bed.\n\n“My luck’s in!” she cried. “I was washing things in the courtyard just now and Baoyu told Sister Xiren to give me some tea to take to Miss Lin. It so happened that the old lady had sent Miss Lin some money which she was distributing to her maids, and when I arrived she gave me two handfuls. I’ve no idea how much it is. Will you keep it for me?”\n\nShe opened her handkerchief and poured out the cash for Xiaohong, who counted it before putting it away.\n\n“How are you feeling these days?” asked Jiahui. “If you ask me, you should go home for a couple of days and call in a doctor to prescribe some medicine. That would soon set you right.”\n\n“What an idea! I’m all right. Why should I go home?”\n\n“I’ve just thought of something. Miss Lin’s often poorly and has to take medicine. Why not ask her for some?”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense! Medicine isn’t something you can take at random.”\n\n“But you can’t go on like this, not eating or drinking properly. How will you manage?”\n\n“What does it matter? The sooner I die the better.”\n\n“What a thing to say when you’re all right!”\n\n“You’ve no idea what’s on my mind.”\n\nJiahui nodded and thought for a moment.\n\n“Well, I don’t blame you,” she said. “This isn’t an easy place to work in. For instance, because Baoyu has been ill so long the old lady said yesterday that all who’d been nursing him deserved a reward, and now that he’s better and she’s offered incense and redeemed her vows everywhere, she’s going to give them presents according to grade. I’m not complaining that I’m too young to be put on the list; but why should you be left out? I think that’s unfair. I don’t grudge Xiren the highest reward — she deserves it. Honestly, who can compare with her? Quite apart from the fact that she’s so conscientious and helpful, even if she weren’t we couldn’t do without her. What makes me mad is that Qingwen and Yixia should be put on the highest grade. Just because Baoyu’s fond of them, everybody makes much of them. Don’t you think that’s outrageous?”\n\n“There’s no call to be angry. As the proverb says, ‘Even the longest feast must break up at last.’ Who’s going to stay here all her life? In another three or five years we’ll all be going our different ways, and then it won’t matter what becomes of any of us.”\n\nThis touched Jiahui to the heart. Her eyes reddened and, not wanting to cry for no reason, she forced a smile.\n\n“You’re right. But yesterday Baoyu was talking about the rooms to be done up and the clothes to be made, as if we had hundreds of years ahead of us.”\n\nXiaohong gave a scornful laugh.\n\nShe was interrupted by a young maid with unplucked eyebrows who ran in, holding some embroidery patterns and two sheets of paper.\n\n“You’re to copy these patterns,” said the child. She tossed them to Xiaohong and darted away.\n\n“Who for?” Xiaohong called after her. “Can’t you wait to finish what you’re saying? Who’s keeping steamed buns warm for you, afraid they may get cold?”\n\n“For Sister Xiren,” answered the little maid from the courtyard. Then pitter-patter, pitter-patter, she ran off.\n\nIn high dudgeon Xiaohong tossed the patterns aside and started hunting in the drawer for a paintbrush. But after some search all she found were a few worn-out ones.\n\n“Where’s that new brush I had the other day?” she grumbled. “How stupid of me to forget.” After thinking hard she suddenly smiled. “I remember. Ying’er took it the other evening.” She turned to Jiahui. “Fetch it for me, will you?”\n\n“Sister Xiren’s waiting for me to fetch her box. Get it yourself.”\n\n“If she’s waiting, why are you sitting here gossiping? If I don’t make you go, she won’t get her box, you little slut.”\n\nSo Xiaohong went out herself. She had just passed Seeping Fragrance Pavilion on her way to Bacchai’s compound when she saw Nanny Li, Baoyu’s old wet-nurse, approaching.\n\n“Where are you going, nanny?” she asked with a smile. “How come you’re coming from that direction?”\n\nThe old woman stopped and slapped one hand.\n\n“Just look at that now,” she cried. “He’s taken a fancy to some Yun or other and he’s making me go to fetch him. If Their Ladyships get to hear of this, there’ll be trouble.”\n\n“Are you really going to fetch him, nanny?”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“If he has any sense, he won’t come.”\n\n“Of course he’ll come. Why shouldn’t he?”\n\n“If he does, you shouldn’t bring him in yourself but let him find his own way here and see what happens.”\n\n“Haven’t I enough to do, trailing round with him? I shall just tell him and send a maid or old nurse to bring him in.” Leaning on her cane, the old woman went on her way.\n\nXiaohong stood there lost in thought, forgetting to fetch the brush. Presently another young maid came running up.\n\n“What are you doing here, sister?” she asked when she saw Xiaohong.\n\nXiaohong looked up and saw it was Zhuier.\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“I’ve to take Master Yun in.” With that she ran on.\n\nXiaohong had just reached the gate at the bridge when Zhuier appeared with Jia Yun. As he walked along, Jia Yun shot a glance at the girl, who deliberately chatted with Zhuier as she stole a look at him. Their eyes met. Xiaohong blushed and turned away to go to Alpinia Park. But no more of this.\n\nJia Yun followed Zhuier then to Happy Red Court. She went in first to announce him and then ushered him in. He saw some miniature rocks and plantains, with two storks under a pine preening their feathers. The covered corridors were hung with cages containing different kinds of rare birds. Above the five-sectioned lodging with its tastefully carved and painted partitions hung a board inscribed with the words: Happy Red and Delightful Green.\n\n“No wonder it’s called Happy Red Court,” thought Jia Yun.\n\nOn the tablet were these four words. He was still musing when a voice called from the other side of the gauze window, “Come on in. How is it I’ve forgotten you all these months?”\n\nRecognizing Baoyu’s voice, Jia Yun entered. Looking up, he was dazzled by a blaze of gold and splendour but could not see where Baoyu was. Then turning his head he caught sight of a large mirror let into the partition on the left, and out from behind this came two girls of fifteen or sixteen, who announced:\n\n“Master Bao asks you to take a seat in the inner room.”\n\nNot venturing to look at them directly, Jia Yun assented and followed them through a second partition of green gauze into a small room hung with a flowered curtain of red silk from which gold patterns had been rubbed. Baoyu, in informal dress, was sitting on the edge of the bed, a book in his hand. When he saw his visitor he tossed the book aside and stood up with a smile. Jia Yun stepped forward to pay his respects and Baoyu made him take a seat on a chair below the bed.\n\n“Since I saw you that month and told you to come and see me in my study,” said Baoyu, “one thing after another cropped up and I clean forgot you.”\n\n“It was my bad luck,” rejoined Jia Yun, “falling ill just when you were unwell, uncle. Are you quite better now?”\n\n“Yes, quite. I hear you were hard at work for several days.”\n\n“I was glad to do what I could. Your recovery means good fortune for our whole family.”\n\nAs he was speaking a maid brought in tea. While talking to Baoyu, Jia Yun was eyeing this slender, oval-faced girl in a pink silk jacket, blue satin sleeveless jacket and white silk figured satin skirt. Since his attendance during Baoyu’s illness he had learned by heart the names of half the inmates of the mansion. He knew that this was Xiren, who had a higher position than the other maids in Baoyu’s apartments. And now that she had brought him tea with Baoyu sitting right there, he rose quickly to his feet with a smile.\n\n“Sister, how can I trouble you to wait on me?” he protested. “When I call on uncle I’m not a guest. I could have poured my own tea.”\n\n“Just sit down,” said Baoyu. “That’s how they’re trained to serve.”\n\n“I know, uncle, but how dare I take liberties in front of the young ladies in your room?”\n\nAs he said this he sat down again to drink his tea, while Baoyu chatted about one thing and nothing — which family had the best actors, which the best garden; whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the best feasts; who had unusual curios, who had rare goods. Jia Yun had to humour him, and after a while, seeing that Baoyu was rather tired, he rose to take his leave. Baoyu did not press him to stay.\n\n“Come again when you’re free tomorrow,” was all he said, and he told a young maid to see the visitor out.\n\nOnce outside Happy Red Court, Jia Yun looked round. When he saw that there was no one about he slackened his pace and started chatting with Zhui’er, asking how old she was, what her name was, what her parents did, how many years she had been with Baoyu, how much she made a month, and how many girls there were altogether in his apartments. Zhui’er answered all his questions.\n\nThen he asked, “Is the one who was talking to you just now called Xiaohong?”\n\n“Yes, she is,” said Zhui’er with a smile. “Why do you ask?”\n\n“She was asking you about some handkerchief, and it so happens I’ve found one.”\n\nAt that Zhui’er exclaimed, “She’s asked me several times if I’ve seen it. But I’ve no time to bother about such things. She said today if I found it for her she’d reward me. Now just back in Alpinia Park....”\n\nYou heard what was said at the gate, sir, so you know I’m not lying. Now that you’ve found it, sir, please give it to me. I want to see how she rewards me.”\n\nNow the previous month, when Jia Yun came in to plant trees, he had picked up a handkerchief. Knowing that it must belong to someone in the Garden but not to whom, he had not ventured to do anything about it. Now that he heard Hongyu questioning Zhuier, he knew it must be hers and was overjoyed. When Zhuier asked for it back, he had an idea. He took his own handkerchief from his sleeve.\n\n“I’ll give you this,” he said. “But mind you don’t keep her reward all to yourself.”\n\nZhuier assented readily and took the handkerchief. Then she saw him out and went back to find Hongyu. But no more of this.\n\nAfter Baoyu had sent Jia Yun away he felt so listless that he lay down on his bed and dozed off. Xiren came and sat on the edge of the bed to shake him.\n\n“How can you sleep again?” she asked. “If you’re feeling bored, why not go for a stroll outside?”\n\nHe took her hand and replied with a smile, “I’d like to, but I can’t bear to leave you.”\n\n“Get up!” She smiled and pulled him up.\n\n“Where can I go? I’m sick of everything.”\n\n“Once you’re out you’ll be all right. Moping like this will only make you more depressed.”\n\nSo listlessly Baoyu let himself be persuaded to go out. He amused himself for a while with the birds on the verandah, then strolled out of the court to look at the goldfish in Seeping Fragrance Stream. He saw two fawns dart like arrows down the opposite hillside, and was wondering what had startled them when Jia Lan appeared in pursuit, a small bow in his hand. At sight of Baoyu the boy halted.\n\n“So you’re at home, uncle,” he said. “I thought you’d gone out.”\n\n“What mischief are you up to now?” asked Baoyu. “Why shoot at those poor little things?”\n\n“I’ve no school today and I’ve nothing to do,” Jia Lan explained. “I was just practising archery and horsemanship.”\n\n“Wait till you chip your teeth, then you’ll stop.”\n\nBaoyu walked on then until he reached a courtyard gate. He saw the dense green of massed phoenix tails and heard the faint rustle of dragon beards. This was Bamboo Lodge. Strolling in, he found the bamboo screen hanging low and all quiet within. When he reached the window he caught a whiff of subtle fragrance through the green gauze. Pressing his face to the gauze he heard a long, faint sigh and the words:\n\n“Each day in a drowsy dream of love.”\n\nHis heart started to beat faster. Looking in he saw Daiyu stretching herself on her bed.\n\n“Why ‘each day in a drowsy dream of love’?” he asked with a grin, lifting the portiere and stepping inside.\n\nDaiyu, ashamed to have been overheard, hid her face in her sleeves and turned towards the wall pretending to be asleep.\n\n“I won’t let you sleep!” he cried, starting to turn her over.\n\nBut before he could do so two old nurses hurried in.\n\n“She’s asleep, sir. Please come back after she’s woken up.”\n\nAs they spoke Daiyu sat up with a laugh.\n\n“Who’s asleep?” she asked.\n\n“We thought you were asleep, miss.” The nurses chuckled and called for Zijuan. “Your young lady’s awake. Come in and keep her company.”\n\nWith that they left.\n\nDaiyu sat up, smoothing her hair, and smiled at Baoyu.\n\n“Why come in when people are asleep?”\n\nAs he saw her starry eyes slightly veiled and her fragrant cheeks flushed, he could not help being enchanted. He flopped down on a chair and asked with a smile:\n\n“What was that you were saying just now?”\n\n\"I didn’t say anything.\" Dai-yu denied it.\n\nHe laughed. \"I’ll give you a betel-nut to crack. I heard you all right.\"\n\nAs they were talking Zijuan came in.\n\n\"Zijuan,\" said Baoyu with a smile, \"make me a cup of your best tea, will you?\"\n\n\"We’ve none of the best here,\" she retorted. \"If you want the best you’ll have to wait for Xiren.\"\n\n\"Don’t take any notice of him,\" Dai-yu told her. \"First go and fetch me some water.\"\n\n\"He’s a guest, so of course I must make him tea before I fetch water.\" With that she went out to brew tea.\n\n\"What a good girl!\" exclaimed Baoyu. \"If I shared the love-bird curtain with your sweet mistress, would I let you make the bed and put out the pillows?\"\n\nDai-yu burst into tears at once.\n\n\"How disgusting!\" she cried. \"You’ve picked up some vulgar talk outside and come here to insult me. I’ll report you to uncle and aunt.\" She ran off weeping towards the inner room.\n\nBaoyu stopped her in alarm. \"I deserve to die for saying such a thing,\" he pleaded. \"Don’t tell on me, there’s a dear! If ever I talk that way again, may a boil grow on my tongue and may it rot away!\"\n\nJust then Xiren came in. \"You’re wanted quick,\" she announced. \"You must go and change.\"\n\nThis news shook Baoyu like a thunder-clap. Forgetting everything else he hurried back to change. As he left the Garden he saw Beiming waiting for him by the inner gate.\n\n\"Why does my father want me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just come along quick, sir. You’ll find out when you get there.\" The boy urged him on.\n\nThey had rounded the large hall when Baoyu, still very uneasy, heard a loud guffaw from behind the corner of the wall. Xue Pan clapped his hands as he jumped out.\n\n\"If I hadn’t said the old man wanted you, you wouldn’t have come out so fast.\" Beiming chuckled and dropped to his knees.\n\nBaoyu stood gaping, too taken aback to collect his wits, until Xue Pan bowed and apologized.\n\n\"Don’t blame the lad,\" he begged. \"I put him up to it.\"\n\nBaoyu could not help laughing.\n\n\"You can fool me if you like, but why say my father wanted me? I’ve a good mind to tell aunt and see what she thinks of such a joke.\"\n\n\"I only wanted you out quickly, good brother, and forgot to watch my tongue. Next time you play a trick on me, just say my father wants me, and we’ll be quits.\"\n\n\"For goodness sake!\" cried Baoyu. \"You deserve to die even more than I did just now.\" He turned to Beiming. \"What are you kneeling for, you young scoundrel?\" The boy kowtowed and stood up.\n\nXue Pan then explained, \"I wouldn’t have disturbed you for nothing, but tomorrow, the third, is my birthday, and old Cheng and old Hu — goodness knows where they found them — have given me such rare presents: a fresh lotus-root as thick as that and so long, a melon as big as that, a huge pig and a big Siamese fish smoked with spirit cypress, tribute offerings from Siam. What do you say to such gifts? The fish and pork may be expensive and hard to come by, but the melon and lotus-root — how on earth did they grow them? I gave some first to my mother, then sent some quickly to your mother and Aunt Xue. But I’ve kept some to celebrate with. It would be too selfish to enjoy them alone, and thinking it over I decided you’re the only one besides me who deserves such dainties. That’s why I specially asked you over. And I’ve a young singer here too. Suppose we make a day of it?\"\n\nAs he was speaking they reached his study, where Zhan Guang, Cheng Rixing, Hu Silai and Shan Renren were gathered with the young actor. At sight of Baoyu they paid their respects and asked after his health.\n\n\"Good, now you've all met.\" After tea Xue Pan ordered a servant to bring wine. Before he had finished speaking the pages set to and in no time, the table was laid. Baoyu was impressed by the novel fruit -- melons and lotus-roots.\n\n\"I haven't brought my birthday present yet, but here I am putting you to expense,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"That's right,\" answered Xue Pan. \"What novel gift are you thinking of bringing tomorrow?\"\n\n\"I've nothing worth giving,\" said Baoyu. \"As for money, food or clothes, those aren't really mine to give. The only thing I can call my own is to write something or paint a picture.\"\n\n\"That reminds me,\" cried Xue Pan. \"I saw some amorous pictures yesterday which were not at all bad. There were inscriptions too, but I didn't look carefully -- just noticed the signature, which was Geng Huang. They were really fine.\"\n\nBaoyu could not help suspecting that this must be a mistake. He had seen a good many old and modern paintings but had never come across an artist called Geng Huang. After thinking it over for a while, he burst out laughing and called for a brush. He wrote two characters on the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Are you sure it was Geng Huang?\" he asked Xue Pan.\n\n\"Of course I'm sure.\"\n\nBaoyu opened his hand to show him. \"Are you sure it wasn't these two characters? They're not unlike Geng Huang.\" The others saw that the two characters were Tang Yin. \"Of course,\" they cried laughingly. \"It must have been Tang Yin. Perhaps the gentleman's eyes were dazzled.\"\n\nXue Pan was most embarrassed. \"Who cares whether it's 'sugar silver' or 'fruit silver'?\" he spluttered.\n\nJust then a servant announced, \"Master Feng is here.\" Baoyu knew that this must be Feng Ziying, the son of General Feng Tang of the Divine Might. Xue Pan and the rest called out, \"Ask him in quickly.\" Even as they spoke in came Feng Ziying, laughing and talking. They all rose to offer him a seat.\n\n\"Well!\" he cried. \"So you're feasting at home instead of going out.\"\n\n\"It's a long time since we saw you last,\" said Baoyu and Xue Pan. \"We hope the old gentleman is well.\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you. My mother caught a chill the other day, though, and she's been poorly for a couple of days.\"\n\nXue Pan noticed a bruise on Feng Ziying's face. \"Who have you been fighting with again?\" he asked. \"You've been hanging up a sign.\"\n\n\"Since that time I beat up the son of Commandant Chou, I've learned my lesson and never lose my temper. So how could I get into a fight? This bruise on my face I got the other day falconing on Iron-Net Mountain when my goshawk gave me a flap with his wing.\"\n\n\"When was that?\" asked Baoyu.\n\n\"We set out on the twenty-eighth of the third month and came back only the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"No wonder I didn't see you the other day at Brother Shen's place when I went to his party. I meant to ask why, but it slipped my mind. Did you go alone or with the old gentleman?\"\n\n\"I went with my father. I couldn't get out of it. Am I crazy? Why should I pass up good times with you, drinking and listening to music, to go looking for trouble? Still, although this trip was a bore I had a stroke of luck.\"\n\nWhen they saw that Feng Ziying had finished his tea, the others urged, \"Do take a seat now. You can tell us your story later.\"\n\nAt that he rose to his feet. \"I really ought to keep you company, but I have something important to see my father about today. I hope you'll excuse me.\"\n\nXue Pan, Baoyu and the rest would not hear of this and tried to detain him by force.\n\n\"This is strange,\" protested Feng Ziying. \"In all these years, have you ever known me to stand on ceremony? I really can't stay. If you insist, then fetch me a big cup and I'll drink two cups with you.\"\n\nThis they had to agree to....\n\nIn the end Xue Pan poured the wine and Baoyu, holding the wine-pot, filled two large cups. Feng Ziying standing up tossed off one cup at a draught.\n\n“Do at least tell us what you meant by ‘a lucky misfortune’ before you go,” begged Baoyu.\n\n“I haven’t enjoyed myself enough today,” replied Feng Ziying. “I mean to invite you all to a special feast one day for a good, long talk, and also to ask a favour of you.” With that he walked off.\n\n“The fellow’s left us all on tenterhooks,” cried Xue Pan. “When is this feast to be? Do let us know to save us fretting.”\n\n“Any time within the next ten days.” Feng Ziying waved goodbye and mounted his horse to ride away.\n\nThe others went back to their seats and drank for a while longer before dispersing.\n\nWhen Baoyu got back to the Garden, Xiren, who had been worrying all this time about his summons from his father, was waiting anxiously to know whether it boded good or ill. She was greeted by the sight of her young master returning dead drunk. When she asked what had happened, he told her the whole story.\n\n“I’ve been on tenterhooks all this time,” she scolded, “and you went off to enjoy yourself without so much as sending word to set my mind at rest.”\n\n“I meant to send a message, but then Brother Feng turned up and it slipped my mind.”\n\nJust then Baochai came in.\n\n“So you’ve been feasting on all the delicacies without me,” she said with a smile.\n\n“If it was your family’s food, of course we had first taste,” countered Baoyu.\n\nBaochai shook her head.\n\n“I’m afraid I’m not fated to enjoy such dainties. Yesterday when my brother made a point of inviting me to join you, I told him to keep the things for others.”\n\nA maid served tea then and they chatted for a while. But no more of this.\n\nLet us return to Daiyu. Having heard that Jia Zheng had sent for Baoyu, who had not come back all day, she was worried too. After dinner she heard that he had returned and decided to go and ask what had happened. She walked slowly towards Happy Red Court. Seeing Baochai go into the courtyard just ahead of her, she followed. But when she reached Drenched Blossoms Bridge she was so fascinated by the waterfowl of all descriptions bathing in the pool — she could not tell their names but they had gorgeous, variegated plumage — that she stopped to watch them for a while. By the time she reached Happy Red Court the gate was closed. She knocked.\n\nNow Qingwen and Bihen had been quarrelling and were in a bad temper. And the sight of Baochai, whom Qingwen unfairly held responsible for her annoyance, had provoked her to complain sotto voce in the courtyard:\n\n“She’s always dropping in for a sit-down, keeping us up till the third watch and not letting us get to sleep.”\n\nHearing now another knock at the gate, she called out crossly without even asking who it was:\n\n“They’ve all gone to bed. Come back tomorrow.”\n\nDaiyu knew the ways of these maids and was afraid the girl, accustomed to their joking, had failed to recognize her voice and taken her for another maid. So she called more loudly:\n\n“It’s me. Aren’t you going to open the gate?”\n\nQingwen, however, still did not recognize her.\n\n“I don’t care who you are,” she retorted. “Master Bao’s given orders that no one’s to be admitted.”\n\nThis left Daiyu speechless with anger. She was on the point of crying out and reproaching the maid, but then it occurred to her:\n\n“Although my uncle’s house is like my own, now that both my parents are dead I’m dependent on others. If I make a scene I shall only make myself look ridiculous....”\n\nAt this thought tears rolled down her cheeks. She was turning back, not knowing where to go, when she heard sounds of laughter and talking inside. She listened carefully and identified the voices of Baoyu and Baochai. This made her even more angry, and she thought back over the morning’s happenings.\n\n“I suppose Baoyu is angry with me for telling on him,” she reflected.\n\n\"Since when have I ever told on you? You might at least have found out before flying into such a rage. Even if you won't let me in today, are you never going to see me again?\" The more she thought the more she felt her heart ache.\n\nQuite regardless of the cold dew on the green moss and the chill wind on the path, she lingered by the corner of the wall under the blossom. And the sound of her sobbing there made the birds fly away from their nests in the boughs and trees nearby, unable to bear the sadness of it. Truly:\n\nFlower spirits in their sadness faint away;\n\nFrom sweet dreams birds are startled in affright.\n\nAs another poem testifies:\n\nNone in the world with Frowner can compare;\n\nAlone she leaves the inner room, forlorn.\n\nHardly has she sobbed out her broken prayer\n\nWhen birds take flight and falling flowers mourn.\n\nDai-yu was still weeping when the gate creaked open. But who came out is told in the following chapter."
