  "original": "却说黛玉叫进宝钗家的女人来，问了好，呈上书子，黛玉叫他去喝茶，便将宝钗来书打开看时，只见上面写着：\n　　妹生辰不偶，家运多艰，姊妹伶仃，萱亲衰迈。兼之声狺语，日暮无休；更道惨祸飞灾，不啻惊风密雨。夜深辗侧，愁绪何堪。属在同心，能不为之愍恻乎？回忆海棠结社，序属清秋，对菊持螯，同盟欢洽。犹记“孤标傲世偕谁隐，一样开花为底迟”之句，未尝不叹冷节馀芳，如吾两人也！感怀触绪，聊赋四章。匪曰无故呻吟，亦长歌当哭之意耳。\n　　悲时序之递嬗兮，又属清秋。感遭家之不造兮，独处离愁。北堂有萱兮，何以忘优？无以解忧兮，我心咻咻。\n　　云凭凭今秋风酸，步中庭兮霜叶干。何去何从兮失我故欢，静言思之兮恻肺肝。\n　　惟鲔有潭兮，惟鹤有梁。鳞早潜伏兮，羽毛何长！搔首问兮茫茫，高天厚地兮，谁知余之永伤？\n　　银河耿耿兮寒气侵，月色横斜兮玉漏沉。忧心炳炳兮我哀吟。吟复吟兮寄我知音。\n　　黛玉看了，不胜伤感。又想：“宝姐姐不寄与别人，单寄与我，也是‘惺惺惜惺惺’的意思。”正在沉吟，只听见外面有人说道：“林姐姐在家里呢么？”黛玉一面把宝钗的书叠起，口内便答应道：“是谁？”正问着，早见几个人进来，却是探春、湘云、李纹、李绮。彼此问了好，雪雁倒上茶来，大家喝了，说些闲话。因想起前年的“菊花诗”来，黛玉便道：“宝姐姐自从挪出去，来了两遭，如今索性有事也不来了，真真奇怪。我看他终久还来我们这里不来！”探春微笑道：“怎么不来？横竖要来的。如今是他们尊嫂有些脾气，姨妈上了年纪的人，又兼有薛大哥的事，自然得宝姐姐照料一切。那里还比得先前有工夫呢？”\n　　正说着，忽听得唿喇喇一片风声，吹了好些落叶打在窗纸上。停了一回儿，又透过一阵清香来。众人闻着，都说道：“这是何处来的香风？这象什么香？”黛玉道：“好象木樨香。”探春笑道：“林姐姐终不脱南边人的话。这大九月里的，那里还有桂花呢？”黛玉笑道：“原是啊，不然，怎么不竟说‘是’桂花香，只说似乎‘象’呢。”湘云道：“三姐姐，你也别说。你可记得‘十里荷花，三秋桂子’？在南边正是晚桂开的时候了，你只没有见过罢了。等你明日到南边去的时候，你自然也就知道了。”探春笑道：“我有什么事到南边去？况且这个也是我早知道的，不用你们说嘴。”李纹、李绮只抿着嘴儿笑。黛玉道：“妹妹，这可说不齐。俗语说：‘人是地行仙。’今日在这里，明日就不知在那里。譬如我原是南边人，怎么到了这里呢？”湘云拍着手笑道：“今儿三姐姐可叫林姐姐问住了。不但林姐姐是南边人到这里，就是我们这几个人就不同：也有本来是北边的；也有根子是南边，生长在北边；也有生长在南边，到这北边的。今儿大家都凑在一处，可见人总有一个定数。大凡地和人，总是各自有缘分的。”众人听了都点头，探春也只是笑。又说了一会子闲话儿，大家散出。黛玉送至门口，大家都说：“你身上才好些，别出来了，看着了风。”\n　　于是黛玉一面说着话儿，一面站在门口，又与四人殷勤了几句，便看着他们出院去了。进来坐着，看看已是林鸟归山，夕阳西坠。因史湘云说起南边的话，便想着：“父母若在，南边的景致，春花秋月，水秀山明，二十四桥，六朝遗迹。不少下人伏侍，诸事可以任意，言语亦可不避。香车画舫，红杏青帘，惟我独尊。今日寄人篱下，纵有许多照应，自己无处不要留心。不知前生作了什么罪孽，今生这样孤凄！真是李后主说的，‘此间日中只以眼泪洗面’矣！”一面思想，不知不觉神往那里去了。\n　　紫鹃走来，看见这样光景，想着必是因刚才说起南边北边的话来，一时触着黛玉的心事了。便问道：“姑娘们来说了半天话，想来姑娘又劳了神了。刚才我叫雪雁告诉厨房里，给姑娘作了一碗火肉白菜汤，加了一点儿虾米儿，配了点青笋紫菜，姑娘想着好么？”黛玉道：“也罢了。”紫鹃道：“还熬了一点江米粥。”黛玉点点头儿，又说道：“那粥得你们两个自己熬了，不用他们厨房里熬才是。”紫鹃道：“我也怕厨房里弄的不干净，我们自己熬呢。就是那汤，我也告诉雪雁合柳嫂儿说了，要弄干净着。柳嫂儿说了：他打点妥当，拿到他屋里，叫他们五儿瞅着炖呢。”黛玉道：“我倒不是嫌人家腌。只是病了好些日子，不周不备，都是人家，这会子又汤儿粥儿的调度，未免惹人厌烦。”说着，眼圈儿又红了。紫鹃道：“姑娘这话也是多想。姑娘是老太太外孙女儿，又是老太太心坎儿上的。别人求其在姑娘跟前讨好儿还不能呢，那里有抱怨的？”黛玉点点头儿。因又问道：“你才说的五儿，不是那日合宝二爷那边的芳官在一处的那个女孩儿？”紫鹃道：“就是他。”黛玉道：“不听见说要进来么？”紫鹃道：“可不是，因为病了一场。后来好了，才要进来，正是晴雯他们闹出事来的时候，也就耽搁住了。”黛玉道：“我看那丫头倒也还头脸儿干净。”说着，外头婆子送了汤来。雪雁出来接时，那婆子说道：“柳嫂儿叫回姑娘，这是他们五儿作的，没敢在大厨房里作，怕姑娘嫌腌。”雪雁答应着，接了进来。黛玉在屋里，已听见，吩咐雪雁：“告诉那老婆子回去说，叫他费心。”雪雁出来说了，老婆子自去。这里雪雁将黛玉的碗箸安放在小几儿上，因问黛玉道：“还有咱们南来的五香大头菜，拌些麻油、醋，可好么？”黛玉道：“也使得，只不必累坠了。”一面盛上粥来。黛玉吃了半碗，用羹匙舀了两口汤喝，就搁下了。两个丫鬟撤下来了，拭净了小几，端下去，又换上一张常放的小几。黛玉漱了口，盥了手，便道：“紫鹃，添了香了没有？”紫鹃道：“就添去。”黛玉道：“你们就把汤合粥吃了罢，味儿还好，且是干净。待我自己添香罢。”两个人答应了，在外间自吃去了。\n　　这里黛玉添了香，自己坐着，才要拿本书看，只听得园内的风自西边直透到东边，穿过树枝，都在那里唏哗喇不住的响。一会儿，檐下的铁马也只管叮叮当当的乱敲起来。一时雪雁先吃完了，进来伺候。黛玉便问道：“天气冷了，我前日叫你们把那小毛儿衣裳晾晾，可曾晾过没有？”雪雁道：“都晾过了。”黛玉道：“你拿一件来我披披。”雪雁走去，将一包小毛衣裳抱来，打开毡包，给黛玉自拣。只见内中夹着个绢包儿。黛玉伸手拿起，打开看时，却是宝玉病时送来的旧绢子，自己题的诗，上面泪痕犹在。里头却包着那剪破了的香囊、扇袋并宝玉通灵玉上的穗子。原来晾衣裳时从箱中捡出，紫鹃恐怕遗失了，遂夹在毡包里的。这黛玉不看则已，看了时，也不说穿那一件衣裳，手里只拿着那两方手帕，呆呆的看那旧诗。看了一回，不觉得簌簌泪下。\n　　紫鹃刚从外间进来，只见雪雁正捧着一毡包衣裳，在旁边呆立，小几上却搁着剪破了的香囊和两三截儿扇袋并那铰拆了的穗子。黛玉手中却拿着两方旧帕子，上边写着字迹，在那里对着滴泪呢。正是：失意人逢失意事，新啼痕间旧啼痕。紫鹃见了这样，知是他触物伤情，感怀旧事，料道劝也无益，只得笑着道：“姑娘，还看那些东西作什么？那都是那几年宝二爷和姑娘小时，一时好了，一时恼了，闹出来的笑话儿。要象如今这样厮抬厮敬的，那里能把这些东西白遭塌了呢。”紫鹃这话原给黛玉开心，不料这几句话更提起黛玉初来时和宝玉的旧事来，一发珠泪连绵起来。紫鹃又劝道：“雪雁这里等着呢，姑娘披上一件罢。”那黛玉才把手帕撂下。紫鹃连忙拾起，将香袋等物包起拿开。这黛玉方披了一件皮衣，自己闷闷的走到外间来坐下。回头看见案上宝钗的诗启尚未收好，又拿出来瞧了两遍，叹道：“境遇不同，伤心则一。不免也赋四章，翻入琴谱，可弹可歌，明日写出来寄去，以当和作。”便叫雪雁将外边桌上笔砚拿来，濡墨挥毫，赋成四叠。又将琴谱翻出，借他《猗兰》《思贤》两操，合成音韵，与自己做的配齐了，然后写出，以备送与宝钗。又即叫雪雁向箱中将自己带来的短琴拿出，调上弦，又操演了指法。黛玉本是个绝顶聪明人，又在南边学过几时，虽是手生，到底一理就熟。抚了一番，夜已深了，便叫紫鹃收拾睡觉，不提。\n　　却说宝玉这日起来，梳洗了，带着焙茗正往书房中来，只见墨雨笑嘻嘻的跑来，迎头说道：“二爷今日便宜了。太爷不在书房里，都放了学了。”宝玉道：“当真的么？”墨雨道：“二爷不信，那不是三爷和兰哥来了？”宝玉看时，只见贾环、贾兰跟着小厮们，两个笑嘻嘻的，嘴里咭咭呱呱不知说些什么，迎头来了。见了宝玉，都垂手站住。宝玉问道：“你们两个怎么就回来了？”贾环道：“今日太爷有事，说是放一天学，明儿再去呢。”宝玉听了，方回身到贾母、贾政处去禀明了，然后回到怡红院中。袭人问道：“怎么又回来了？”宝玉告诉了他。只坐了一坐儿，便往外走，袭人道：“往那里去，这样忙法？就放了学，依我说，也该养养神儿了。”宝玉站住脚，低了头，说道：“你的话也是，但是好容易放一天学，还不散散去。你也该可怜我些儿了。”袭人见说的可怜，笑道：“由爷去罢。”正说着，端了饭来，宝玉也没法儿，只得且吃饭。三口两口忙忙的吃完，漱了口，一溜烟往黛玉房中去了。\n　　走到门口，只见雪雁在院中晾绢子呢。宝玉因问：“姑娘吃了饭了么？”雪雁道：“早起喝了半碗粥，懒怠吃饭，这时候打盹儿呢。二爷且到别处走走，回来再来罢。”宝玉只得回来。无处可去，忽然想起惜春有好几天没见，便信步走到蓼风轩来。刚到窗下．只见静悄悄一无人声，宝玉打量他也睡午觉，不便进去。才要走时，只听屋里微微一响，不知何声；宝玉站往再听，半日，又“拍”的一响。宝玉还未听出，只见一个人道：“你在这里下了一个子儿，那里你不应么？”宝玉方知是下棋呢。但只急切听不出这个人的语音是谁。底下方听见惜春道：“怕什么？你这么一吃我，我这么一应，你又这么吃，我又这么应，还缓着一着儿呢，终久连的上。”那一个又道：“我要这么一吃呢？”惜春道：“阿嘎，还有一着反扑在里头呢，我倒没防备。”宝玉听了听那一个声音很熟，却不是他们姊妹，料着惜春屋里也没外人，轻轻的掀帘进去。看时不是别人，却是那栊翠庵的槛外人妙玉。这宝玉见是妙玉，不敢惊动。妙玉和惜春正在凝思之际，也没理会。宝玉却站在旁边，看他两个的手段。只见妙玉低着头，问惜春道：“你这个畸角儿不要了么？”惜春道：“怎么不要？你那里头都是死子儿，我怕什么？”妙玉道：“且别说满话，试试看。”惜春道：“我便打了起来，看你怎么着。”妙玉却微微笑着，把边上子一接，却搭转一吃，把惜春的一个角儿都打起来了，笑着说道：“这叫做‘倒脱靴势’。＂\n　　惜春尚未答言，宝玉在旁情不自禁，哈哈一笑，把两个人都唬了一大跳。惜春道：“你这是怎么说？进来也不言语。这么使促狭唬人！你多早晚进来的？”宝玉道：“我头里就进来了，看着你们两个争这个畸角儿。”说着，一面与妙玉施礼，一面又笑问道：“妙公轻易不出禅关，今日何缘下凡一走？”妙玉听了，忽然把脸一红，也不答言，低了头自看那棋。宝玉自觉造次，连忙陪笑道：“倒是出家人比不得我们在家的俗人。头一件，心是静的。静则灵，灵则慧。”宝玉尚未说完，只见妙玉微微的把眼一抬，看了宝玉一眼，复又低下头去，那脸上的颜色渐渐的红晕起来。宝玉见他不理，只得讪讪的旁边坐了。惜春还要下子，妙玉半日说道：“再下罢。”便起身理理衣裳，重新坐下，痴痴的问着宝玉道：“你从何处来？”宝玉巴不得这一声，好解释前头的话，忽又想道：“或是妙玉的机锋？”转红了脸，答应不出来。妙玉微微一笑，自笑惜春说话。惜春也笑追：“二哥哥，这什么难答的？你没有听见人家常说的，‘从来处来’么？这也值得把脸红了，见了生人的似的。”妙玉听了这话，想起自家，心上一动，脸上一热，必然也是红的，倒觉不好意思起来。因站起来说道：“我来得久了，要回用里去了。”惜春知妙玉为人，也不深留，送出门口。妙玉笑道：“久已不来，这里弯弯曲曲的，回去的路头都要迷住了。”宝玉道：“这倒要我来指引指，何如？”妙玉道：“不敢，二爷前请。”于是二人别了惜春，离了蓼风轩，弯弯曲曲，走近潇湘馆，忽听得叮咚之声。妙玉道：“那里的琴声？”宝玉道：“想必是林妹妹那里抚琴呢。”妙玉道：“原来他也会这个吗？怎么素日不听见提起？”宝玉悉把黛玉的事说了一遍，因说：“咱们去看他。”妙玉道：“从古只有听琴，再没有看琴的。”宝玉笑道：“我原说我是个俗人。”说着，二人走至潇湘馆外，在山子石上坐着静听，甚觉音调清切。只听得低吟道：\n　　风萧潇兮秋气深，美人千里兮独沉中。望故乡今何处？倚栏杆兮涕沾襟。\n　　歇了一回，听得又吟道：\n　　山迢迢兮水长，照轩窗兮明月光。耿耿不寐兮银河渺茫，罗衫怯怯兮风露凉。\n　　又歇了一歇。妙玉道：“刚才‘侵’字韵是第一叠，如今‘阳’字韵是第二叠了。咱们再听。”里边又吟道：\n　　子之遭兮不自由，予之遇兮多烦忧。之子与我兮心焉相投，思古人兮俾无尤。\n　　妙玉道：“这又是一拍。何忧思之深也！”宝玉道：“我虽不懂得，但听他声音，也觉得过悲了。”里头又调了一回弦。妙玉道：“君弦太高了，与无射律只怕不配呢。”里边又吟道：\n　　人生斯世兮如轻尘，天上人间兮感夙因。感夙因兮不可，素心如何天上月！\n　　妙玉听了，呀然失色道：“如何忽作变徵之声？音韵可裂金石矣！只是太过。”宝玉道：“太过便怎么？”妙玉道：“恐不能持久。”正议论时，听得君弦“蹦”的一声断了。妙玉站起来，连忙就走。宝玉道：“怎么样？”妙玉道：“日后自知，你也不必多说。”竟自走了。弄得宝玉满肚疑团，没精打采的，归至怡红院中，不表。\n　　且说妙玉归去，早有道婆接着，掩了庵门，坐了一回，把《禅门日诵》念了一遍。吃了晚饭，点上香，拜了菩萨，命道婆子自去歇着。自己的禅床靠背俱已整齐，屏息垂帘，跏跌坐下，断除妄想，趁向真如。坐到三更以后，听得房上一片响声，妙玉恐有贼来，下了禅床，出到前轩，但见云影横空，月华如水。那时天气尚不很凉，独自一个凭栏站了一回，忽听房上两个猫儿一递一声厮叫。那妙玉忽想起日间宝玉之言，不觉一阵心跳耳热，自己连忙收摄心神，走进掸房，仍到禅床上坐了。怎奈神不守舍，一时如万马奔驰，觉得禅床便恍荡起来，身子已不在庵中。便有许多王孙公子，要来娶他；又有些媒婆扯扯拽拽扶他上车，自己不肯去。一回儿，又有盗贼劫他，持刀执棍的逼勒，只得哭喊求救。\n　　早惊醒了用中女尼道婆等，都拿火来照看，只见妙玉两手撒开，口中流沫。急叫醒时，只见眼睛直竖，两颧鲜红，骂道：“我是有菩萨保佑，你们这些强徒敢要怎么样？”众人都唬的没了主意，都说道：“我们在这里呢，快醒转来罢！”妙玉道：“我要回家去！你们有什么好人，送我回去罢。”道婆道：“这里就是你住的房子。”说着，又叫别的女尼忙向观音前祷告。求了签，翻开签书看时，是触犯了西南角上的阴人。就有一个说：“是了，大观园中西南角上本来没有人住，阴气是有的。”一面弄汤弄水的在那里忙乱。那女尼原是自南边带来的，伏侍妙玉自然比别人尽心，围着妙玉坐在禅床上。妙玉回头道：“你是谁？”女尼道：“是我。”妙玉仔细瞧了一瞧道：“原来是你！”便抱住那女尼，呜呜咽咽的哭起来，说道：“你是我的妈呀，你不救我，我不得活了！”那女尼一面唤醒他，一面给他揉着。道婆倒上茶来喝了，直到天明才睡了。\n　　女尼便打发人去请大夫来看脉。也有说是思虑伤脾的，也有说是热入血室的，也有说是邪崇触犯的，也有说是内外感冒的，终无定论。后请得一个大夫来看了，问：“曾打坐过没有？”道婆说道：“向来打坐的。”大夫道：“这病可是昨夜忽然来的么？”道婆道：“是。”大夫道：“这是走魔入火的原故。”众人问：“有碍没有？”大夫道：“幸亏打坐不久，魔还入得浅，可以有救。”写了降伏心火的药，吃了一剂，稍稍平复些。外面那些游头浪子听见了，便造作许多谣言，说：“这么年纪，那里忍得住？况且又是很风流的人品，很乖觉的性灵，以后不知飞在谁手里，便宜谁去呢。”过了几日，妙玉病虽略好了些，神思未复，终有些恍惚。\n　　一日，惜春正坐着，彩屏忽然进来，回道：“姑娘知道妙玉师父的事吗？”惜春道：“他有什么事？”彩屏道：“我昨日听见邢姑娘和大奶奶在那里说呢，他自从那日合姑娘，下棋回去，夜间忽然中了邪，嘴里乱嚷，说强盗来抢他来了。到如今还没好呢。姑娘，你说这不是奇事吗？”惜春听了，默默无语。因想：“妙玉虽然洁净，毕竟尘缘未断。可惜我生在这种人家，不便出家，我若出了家时，那有邪魔缠扰？一念不生，万缘俱寂。”想到这里，蓦与神会，若有所得，便口占一偈云：\n　　大造本无方，云何是应住？\n　　既从空中来，应向空中去。\n占毕，即命丫头焚香。自己静坐了一回，又翻开那棋谱来，把孔融、王积薪等所著看了几篇。内中“茂叶包蟹势”、“黄莺搏兔势”，都不出奇；“三十六局杀角势”，一时也难会难记，独看到“十龙走马”，觉得甚有意思。正在那里作想，只听见外面一个人走进院来，连叫彩屏。\n未知是谁，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Daiyu invited the woman in and asked after her mistress. When the servant presented the letter, Daiyu told her to go and have some tea while she opened it. This is what she read:\n\n“Since my childhood I have been ill-starred, and now that our family is in decline my lot is even harder. With my young brother dead and my mother failing fast, while malicious gossip makes it impossible for me to live at home — to cap which, fresh disasters have befallen us — I feel as frantic as if I were beset by wind and rain in the dark of night. As I toss and turn sleeplessly, weighed down by anxiety, I wonder that one like yourself who knows my heart does not commiserate with me. I recall how in clear autumn weather, the Crab-Flower Club was formed and we feasted on crabs while enjoying the chrysanthemums. How well I remember your lines:\n\n‘Who shares with you your pride\nIn your recluse’s bower?\nWhy don’t you bloom, like other flowers, in your own hour?’\n\nI cannot help sighing over the fate of fragrant flowers which bloom untimely, like you and me! Moved by the feelings the season evokes in me, I have written four poems. Don’t think this is just empty lamentation, but take it rather as my long-drawn-out cry of grief.\n\nSad that the season should swing round again to clear autumn!\nMy heart is weighed down by my family’s misfortunes and my own sorrow.\nHow can the plant of forgetfulness make me forget my care?\nNo way to banish grief — my heart is harrowed with despair.\n\nThe scudding clouds and acrid wind make autumn more biting cold;\nDry frost-drenched leaves by the steps are swept up in heaps.\nWhere are the friends now from whom I am parted?\nSilent, I ponder, and agony tears my heart.\n\nThe sturgeon has its deep pool, the crane its nest,\nBut scaled creatures dive deep, long-feathered birds have to rest.\nHeaven is high, earth wide, but I lift my head in vain:\nWho knows the unending grief which my heart doth pain?\n\nThe Milky Way shines coldly, the night is still;\nThe moon slants, the jade clepsydra has congealed.\nMy heart is burning, I croon a dirge apart,\nCroon on and on to express my grieving heart.”\n\nThis letter reduced Daiyu to tears. “She didn’t write to anyone else, only to me — isn’t that ‘like sympathizing with like’?” she thought.\n\nShe was plunged in thought when someone outside called, “Is Cousin Lin at home?”\n\nFolding the letter, she answered, “Who is it?”\n\nEven as she spoke, Tanchun, Xiangyun, Li Wen and Li Qi entered. After they had greeted each other and Xueyan had served tea, they chatted for a while. This reminded them of the chrysanthemum poem competition the year before last.\n\n“Since Cousin Chai moved out, she’s only been back twice,” remarked Daiyu. “Now she doesn’t come even when there’s something doing. It’s very strange. I wonder if she’ll ever come back again.”\n\n“Of course she will,” said Tanchun with a smile. “She’s bound to. It’s just that now her sister-in-law is difficult and her mother’s getting on, and then there’s all this trouble over her brother — naturally she has to stay there to look after things. She hasn’t as much time as before, that’s all.”\n\nJust then they heard a rustling outside as the wind blew a shower of dead leaves against the window paper. After a while, a whiff of subtle fragrance wafted in.\n\n“Where does this scent come from?” they exclaimed. “What kind of perfume is it?”\n\n“It smells like cassia,” said Daiyu.\n\n“Cousin Lin is still so southern,” teased Tanchun. “It’s late September now. Where would we get cassia blossom?”\n\n“Right,” retorted Daiyu. “If it weren’t so, why would I say it seems like it instead of stating that it is?”\n\n“You remember the lines,” Xiangyun put in, “‘For ten li the lotus blooms in the breeze, and the cassia fragrance at mid-autumn fills the air.’ At this time of year in the south, the late cassia is in bloom, and you’ve never seen it. When you go south one day, you’ll find out.”\n\nTanchun laughed.\n\n“What reason would I have to go south? Besides, I knew that long ago without your telling me.”\n\nLi Wen and Li Qi simply smiled faintly.\n\n“In this world, one can never tell,” said Daiyu. “As the proverb says, ‘Men are like travelling immortals.’ Today you’re here; tomorrow, goodness knows where. Take my case. I’m a southerner, yet here I am in the North.”\n\nXiangyun clapped her hands.\n\n“Cousin Xifeng really got the better of Third Sister today,” remarked one of the others. “Not only is Cousin Lin a southerner who’s come up here; we’re all different too. Some of us are northerners by birth, some southerners by origin who were born in the north, and others born in the south who’ve come up north. The fact that today we’ve all foregathered shows that everything is predestined. It seems to me that places and people are fated to come together.”\n\nThe rest agreed. Tanchun simply smiled.\n\nAfter some further conversation they took their leave. Daiyu saw them to the gate.\n\n“You’ve only just started getting better,” they warned her. “You mustn’t see us out or you may catch cold.”\n\nSo she stood at the gate chatting with them for a while, then urged the four girls in a friendly way to come again another time. Not until they had left the courtyard did she go back indoors and sit down again. She saw that the birds in the wood had flown back to their nests and the sun was sinking behind the hills.\n\nXiangyun’s mention of the south had set her thinking, “If my parents were still alive and I were at home, I could enjoy the southern scenery in spring and autumn with its beautiful lakes and hills — the Twenty-four Bridges, the relics of the Six Dynasties. I’d have no lack of maids to wait on me and could do as I pleased, with no need to watch my tongue. I could ride in a scented carriage or painted boat, the queen of all I surveyed. But now I’m dependent on others. Though they look after me so well, I have to be careful in every way. What sin have I committed in some past life to be so wretched in this one? As Li Houzhu of the Tang Dynasty said, ‘I’ve washed my face with tears all day....’”\n\nSo her thoughts ran on until she was lost in reverie.\n\nZijuan, coming in and seeing her in this mood, knew that it must have been induced by the talk of south and north.\n\n“The young ladies have been chatting so long, you must be tired out, miss,” she said. “I’ve just told Xueyan to tell the kitchen to prepare you a bowl of ham and cabbage soup with a little dried shrimp and some bamboo-shoots and laver. Will that be all right?”\n\n“Yes,” was the brief answer.\n\n“I’ve also prepared some congee.”\n\nDaiyu nodded, then said, “You must cook that congee yourselves, not let the kitchen do it.”\n\n“I was afraid the kitchen wouldn’t clean it properly, so I’m making it myself. And I told Xueyan to ask Mrs. Liu to see that the soup is cleanly made. She says she’ll prepare it in her own room and get Wu’er to keep an eye on it while it’s stewing.”\n\n“I’m not really fussy,” said Daiyu. “But during my illness I had to put up with all sorts of shortages and have to depend on other people for everything. Now I’m asking for soup and congee, I’m probably getting on their nerves.” Her eyes reddened again.\n\n“That’s you imagining things, miss. You’re the old lady’s granddaughter, her favourite. The others would give anything to have a chance to please you; who’d complain?”\n\nDaiyu nodded. Then she asked, “Didn’t you say Wu’er? Isn’t she the girl I saw the other day with Fangguan from Bao-yu’s place?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“I heard she was going to be sent here. Why hasn’t she come?”\n\n“Yes, she was going to be. But then she fell ill, and after she got better it was just when Qingwen and the others were in trouble, so that held things up.”\n\n“She looked to me a clean-looking girl,” remarked Daiyu.\n\nJust then an old woman brought in the soup. Xueyan went out to take it.\n\n“Mrs. Liu told me to tell you, miss, that Wu’er prepared this,” said the woman. “She didn’t dare do it in the big kitchen for fear you might think it dirty.”\n\nXueyan assented and brought the soup in. Daiyu, who had overheard, told her to...\n\nXueyan went out to tell the old woman this, and the latter left. Then Xueyan set Daiyu’s bowl and chopsticks on a small table and asked, “We’ve still got some spiced salted turnip that we brought from the south. Would you like some of that, miss, with sesame oil and vinegar?”\n\n“Very well, but don’t take too much trouble,” said Daiyu.\n\nXueyan brought in the gruel and Daiyu ate half a bowl, then with a spoon she sipped two mouthfuls of soup before putting it down. Her two maids cleared the small table, wiped it clean and carried it out, bringing back another small table which was usually there. After Daiyu had rinsed her mouth and washed her hands she asked Zijuan, “Have you put more incense in the burner?”\n\n“I’ll do it now.”\n\n“You two had better finish that soup and gruel. It’s quite tasty and clean. I’ll put the incense in myself.”\n\nThey assented and went to the outer room to eat.\n\nDaiyu, having replenished the incense, sat down. She was thinking of reading when she heard the wind in the garden sweeping from west to east through the trees, setting all their branches soughing. Presently the wind-bells under the eaves started tinkling. Soon Xueyan, who had finished her meal, came in to wait on her.\n\n“It’s turned cold,” said Daiyu. “Did you air my fur clothes the other day as I told you?”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“Bring me one to put round my shoulders.”\n\nXueyan went to fetch a bundle of clothes. She undid the felt wrapper and invited Daiyu to choose one. Inside was a silk package which Daiyu picked up and opened. It contained the old handkerchiefs Baoyu had sent her when he was ill, on which she had written poems; and the tear-stains on them were still visible. Wrapped in them were the scented pouch she had cut up, the sachet and the tassel from Baoyu’s Jade of Spiritual Understanding. When airing the clothes, Zijuan had found these in the case and afraid they might get lost had wrapped them in felt and put them in this bundle.\n\nAt sight of them, forgetting all about the clothes, Daiyu picked up the two handkerchiefs and stared blankly at the poems she had written. Without her knowing it, tears coursed down her cheeks.\n\nJust then Zijuan came in and saw Xueyan standing blankly by, holding the bundle of clothes. On the small table were the cut-up scented pouch, the sachet in two or three pieces, and the broken tassel. Daiyu was holding two old handkerchiefs with writing on them, weeping as she looked at them.\n\nTruly:\n\nThe unfortunate meet with fresh misfortune;\n\nNew tears mingle with the old.\n\nRealizing that these keepsakes had stirred Daiyu’s emotions and reminded her of the past, Zijuan knew that it would be no use trying to comfort her.\n\n“Why look at those things, miss?” she asked with a smile. “They’re just reminders of the times when you and Master Bao were children and kept falling out — that’s how these things got spoilt. If you were on as good terms now as you used to be then, these things wouldn’t have been treated so badly.”\n\nShe had meant to cheer Daiyu up, but this reference to her first days here and her tiffs with Baoyu only reduced her to a fresh flood of tears.\n\nSeeing Xueyan still waiting there, Zijuan urged, “Do put on a fur, miss.”\n\nThen at last Daiyu put down the handkerchiefs. Zijuan promptly picked them up and wrapped up the scented pouch and other things to put them away. Only then did Daiyu put on a fur and go listlessly to sit in the outer room. She turned and saw that Baochai’s letter and poems were still on the desk. Taking them out to read again, she sighed.\n\n“Our circumstances are different, but we share the same grief,” she mused. “I must write four poems myself to set to music, so that they can be sung to the lute. I’ll write them out tomorrow and send them to her by way of reply.”\n\nShe told Xueyan to bring her the inkstone and brush from the outer room, then moistened the ink and started writing, producing four poems.\n\nShe folded it up then and got out her manuals of lute music. Selecting two melodies, “The Orchid” and “Longing for a Worthy Man,” she blended them into a melody to match her own composition, then wrote this down to give to Baochai. She told Xueyan to fetch from her case the short lute she had brought with her from the South and, having tuned it, she practised her fingering. A very gifted girl, Daiyu had taken some lessons in her southern home; and though out of practice she soon mastered it again. She played for a time until it was late, then told Zijuan to put away the lute and they went to bed.\n\nLet us return now to Baoyu. He rose and, having washed and combed his hair, was on his way to school with Beiming when Moyu came running towards him, grinning.\n\n“You’re in luck today, Master Bao,” he announced. “The master’s not at school, so it’s a holiday.”\n\n“Is that true?”\n\n“If you don’t believe me, look! Aren’t those Master Huan and Master Lan coming?”\n\nBaoyu saw his brother and nephew approaching, laughing and chatting together, each attended by a page. When they caught sight of Baoyu they halted respectfully.\n\n“Why are you back so soon?” he asked.\n\n“The master has business and has given us a holiday,” Jia Huan told him. “He told us not to go back till the day after tomorrow.”\n\nOnly then did Baoyu turn back to report this to the Lady Dowager and his father, after which he returned to Happy Red Court.\n\n“Why are you back again?” Xiren asked, and he explained.\n\nHe sat down for a little, then started out again.\n\n“Where are you off to in such a hurry?” asked Xiren. “Even if school’s closed, you should take a rest now, in my opinion.”\n\nBaoyu halted and lowered his head.\n\n“You’re right,” he answered. “But I don’t often get a holiday. Can’t I relax for a change? Do have a little pity on me.”\n\nThe plea in his voice made her smile.\n\n“All right,” she said. “Go where you please.”\n\nJust then his meal was served and, much as he disliked the idea, he had to sit down to eat. He bolted it down, rinsed his mouth, and slipped away to Daiyu’s rooms.\n\nAt the gate he saw Xueyan hanging out handkerchiefs in the courtyard.\n\n“Has your young lady had her meal yet?” he asked.\n\n“She had half a bowl of congee first thing,” was the answer. “She didn’t want any proper breakfast and she’s dozing now. You’d better come back later, Master Bao.”\n\nSo he had to leave. With nowhere else to go, he suddenly remembered that he had not seen Xichun for several days and strolled to Alpinia Park. Under her window all was quiet. Assuming that she was having a nap, he was about to leave when he heard a slight sound from inside. Not sure what it was, he halted to listen. After a pause there came another faint sound. Before he could make it out, someone spoke.\n\n“You put a piece there, but aren’t you going to answer me over here?”\n\nThen he knew it was a game of go. The next voice, which he could not identify at once, was Xichun’s.\n\n“What are you afraid of? You take one of my pieces, I counter; you take another, I counter again. I’m still a move ahead and can soon join up my pieces.”\n\n“If I take like this?” asked the other.\n\n“Oh dear! There’s a snap-back. I didn’t guard against that.”\n\nThe other’s voice now sounded familiar, but it was not that of any of the girls. Who could be playing with Xichun? He gently raised the portiere and went in. To his surprise he saw Miaoyu, that nun from Green Lattice Convent. Not wanting to disturb them as they were concentrating on the game, he stood watching. Miaoyu, her head lowered, was studying the board.\n\n“What about this corner?” she asked. “Haven’t you lost it?”\n\n“Of course I do,” retorted Xichun. “But all your stones are dead. What have I to fear?”\n\n“Don’t boast,” warned Miaoyu. “Just wait and see.”\n\n“I’ll make a move and see what you can do.”\n\nSmiling, Miaoyu linked up the stones on one side and by a feint captured one of Xichun’s corners.\n\n“This is called ‘pulling off the boot backwards’!” she chuckled.\n\nBefore Xichun could answer, Baoyu burst out laughing so loudly that both girls started.\n\n“What do you mean by this?” Xichun scolded. “Coming in without a word, and scaring us like that! When did you arrive?”\n\n“Some time ago. I was watching you fighting over this corner.”\n\nHe greeted Miaoyu then asked with a smile, “Why has the reverend sister left her seclusion to descend to the world of men today?”\n\nMiaoyu flushed and lowered her head to study the board without answering. Baoyu, conscious of having been too forward, hastened to apologize.\n\n“Of course, those in holy orders are different from us laymen,” he said. “Their hearts are at peace, and this brings them spiritual understanding and wisdom....”\n\nBefore he could finish, Miaoyu glanced up at him then lowered her head again, a deep blush slowly suffusing her face. As she was ignoring him, he sat down sheepishly at one side.\n\nXichun was about to play when Miaoyu after a long silence said, “Let’s stop.” She rose to her feet, smoothed her clothes, then sat down again and asked Baoyu dreamily, “Where do you come from?”\n\nBaoyu, eager to make up for his blunder, was about to reply when it struck him that this might be a Zen question. He blushed and could not answer.\n\nMiaoyu smiled and turned back to the game, while Xichun teased, “What’s so hard about that, cousin? Haven’t you heard the saying ‘From the place of origin’? There’s no call to blush like that, as if she were a stranger.”\n\nThis reminded Miaoyu of her own situation and set her heart beating faster. She felt her cheeks burning, knew that she must be blushing too, and was most put out. She rose to her feet.\n\n“I’ve been here too long,” she said. “I must be getting back to my nunnery.”\n\nKnowing her ways, Xichun did not press her to stay but saw her to the gate.\n\n“It’s so long since I came here, this place is a regular maze,” said Miaoyu. “I may lose my way going back.”\n\n“Let me show you the way,” offered Baoyu.\n\n“No, thank you. Please lead the way, sir.”\n\nThey left Xichun then and, winding their way past Smartweed Breeze Cot, approached Bamboo Lodge. Suddenly they heard the strains of a lute.\n\n“Where is that music?” asked Miaoyu.\n\n“I suppose Cousin Lin is playing the zither.”\n\n“So she can play too? How is it I’ve never heard this mentioned before?”\n\nBaoyu told her then about Daiyu, and proposed, “Suppose we go to listen.”\n\n“The ancients only listened to lute-playing; they never went to watch it,” she demurred.\n\n“So I really am a vulgarian,” he conceded.\n\nThey sat down on a rock by Bamboo Lodge to listen quietly. The music was clear and pure. They heard a low voice singing:\n\n“The soughing wind and deep autumn days\n\nFind the fair one far away in a sad maze.\n\nWhere is her native land?\n\nLeaning on balustrade, her sleeves with tears are stained.”\n\nAfter a pause, the voice sang again:\n\n“The hills stretch away, the river is long.\n\nThrough the casement shines the bright moon.\n\nSleepless, I gaze at the Milky Way\n\nIn my light robe which feels the wind and dew chill.”\n\nAnother pause.\n\nMiaoyu remarked, “The first stanza was in the ‘invasion’ rhyme, the second in the ‘yang’ rhyme....”\n\nThey listened again. From inside came the words:\n\nYour fate, alas! is not in your hands;\nMy lot is vexed with many a care.\nBut you and I have understanding hearts;\nFor the ancients we need not despair.\n\n“This is another stanza,” remarked Miaoyu. “How melancholy!”\n“Although I don’t understand it, it sounds too pathetic to me too,” said Baoyu.\nThe zither was tuned again inside.\n“The first string is too high,” said Miaoyu. “It doesn’t match the note of wuyi.”\nThen from inside came the lines:\n\nIn this world life is fleeting as light dust;\nHeaven and earth by fate are overspread.\nFate is immutable, heaven’s secret must\nRemain unknown; how can the pure in heart\nBe like the moon that shines in heaven overhead?\n\nMiaoyu turned pale with dismay at this.\n“Why has she suddenly switched to the mournful bianzhi key?” she exclaimed. “It’s so moving, it could melt metal and split stone; but it’s too effusive.”\n“What if it is?” asked Baoyu.\n“I’m afraid this can’t last.”\nAs they were speaking the first string snapped with a twang. Miaoyu rose quickly to her feet and started away.\n“What is it?” he asked.\n“You’ll find out later. There’s no need to ask.” She walked off then and there, leaving Baoyu thoroughly mystified. Feeling very let down he went back in low spirits to Happy Red Court.\n\nAs for Miaoyu, when she reached the Bamboo Lodge an old nun who had been waiting for her closed the gate. She sat down for a while and chanted the Buddhist canon, then after her supper lit some incense and worshipped the Bodhisattva. Having told the old nun to rest, she saw that the cushions on her meditation couch were ready. She closed the door, let down the curtains, adjusted her clothes and sat down cross-legged to compose her mind and concentrate on reaching the truth. But after the third watch she heard a crash on the roof, and fearing that thieves had come she got off the couch and went out to the front corridor. She saw the clouds scudding across the sky and the moonlight clear as water. It was not too cold. Standing there alone by the balustrade, she was startled by the sound of two cats miaowing in turn on the roof. Suddenly she remembered Baoyu’s visit that day, and her face burned, her heart started beating faster. Hastily suppressing her wanton thoughts, she went back to her room and sat on the couch. But she could not compose herself, and her mind was in a turmoil. She felt the couch rock as if she were no longer in the nunnery. Many young noblemen came to ask for her hand, while matchmakers dragged her by main force to a carriage; and when she refused to go, brigands seized her and threatened her at sword-point with death unless she consented.\n\nShe had already alarmed the other nuns in the convent. They brought a lamp and found her with outflung arms, frothing at the mouth. They woke her in haste, but her eyes were glazed and her cheeks bright red. She pushed them away crying:\n“I want to go home! The Bodhisattva will protect me. How dare you brigands kidnap me?”\nThe frightened nuns could not pacify her. They assured her, “We are here. Do wake up!”\n“I want to go back to my parents,” she insisted. “Which of you good people will take me home?”\n“This is where you live,” the old nun told her.\nShe called on the other nuns to pray to the Bodhisattva Guanyin. When they drew a lot from the canister and looked up the answer in the divination book, they read that she had been assailed by an evil spirit from the south-west.\n“That’s it,” said one. “In the south-west corner of the Garden there’s no one living, so it must be haunted.”\nThey bustled about preparing hot water and soup for her.\nThe young nun who had accompanied Miaoyu from the south naturally served her more conscientiously than the rest. She sat on the couch holding her. Miaoyu asked:\n“Who are you?”\n“It’s me.”\nAfter peering at her for a while Miaoyu cried, “So it’s you!” and flung her arms around her sobbing, “You’re my mother! If you don’t save me I’m done for!”\nThe young nun tried to calm her and massaged her, while the old nun brought her some tea. But she pushed it away and started raving again.\n\nShe did not get to sleep until dawn.\n\nThe nuns sent to fetch a doctor to take her pulse. Some diagnosed that anxiety had impaired her spleen; some that heat had entered the blood chamber; some that she was possessed by an evil spirit; others that she had caught a chill. But no two opinions tallied. Later they called in a doctor who asked, “Was she practising yoga?”\n\n“Yes, she always did,” the old serving-woman told him.\n\n“Did this illness come on suddenly last night?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It was because while in a trance she was possessed by a fiend.” When asked if it was serious, he said, “Luckily she has not been long at yoga and the fiend’s possession is not too deep, so she can still be cured.” He prescribed some medicine to reduce the heart-fire, and one dose made her slightly better.\n\nThe profligates outside, hearing of this, made up a rumour: “At her age how can she remain chaste? And she’s such a coquette too, so arch and knowing. We wonder whose hands she’ll fall into and who’ll have the luck.” After a few days, though Miaoyu was slightly better she had not yet recovered her wits and was still rather deranged.\n\nOne day Xichun was sitting at home when Caiping suddenly came in and announced, “Have you heard the news, miss, about the nun Miaoyu?”\n\n“What about her?”\n\n“Yesterday I heard Miss Xing and Madam Zhu talking. They said that after she’d been playing chess with you that day and went back, that night the evil eye struck her. She started raving that robbers had come to carry her off. She’s still not right. Isn’t that strange?”\n\nXichun said nothing but thought, “Although Miaoyu is so pure she can’t escape earthly troubles. It’s too bad I was born into a family like ours, which makes it awkward for me to become a nun. If I were, no evil spirit could overpower me, for then I would be free of all carnal thoughts and all worldly cares.” This led her to feel that she had gained insight. She chanted a Buddhist gatha:\n\nThe Creator has no fixed form,\n\nSo why should we seek a abode?\n\nSince we come from the void,\n\nTo the void we should return.\n\nHaving chanted this, she told her maid to light some incense. She sat quietly for a while, then opened a manual of chess and read several games played by Kong Rong and Wang Jixin. She found “The Crab Hidden by Lush Leaves” and “The Oriole Seizes the Hare” unremarkable; “Thirty-Six Strategies to Corner the Enemy” was too hard to understand or remember. But “Ten Dragons on the March” struck her as interesting. She was still pondering it when someone walked into the courtyard calling for Caiping.\n\nIf you want to know who it was, read the next chapter."
