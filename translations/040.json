  "original": "话说宝玉听了，忙进来看时，只见琥珀站在屏风跟前，说：“快去罢，立等你说话呢。”宝玉来至上房，只见贾母正和王夫人众姐妹商议给史湘云还席。宝玉因说：“我有个主意：既没有外客，吃的东西也别定了样数，谁素日爱吃的，拣样儿做几样。也不必按桌席，每人跟前摆一张高几，各人爱吃的东西一两样，再一个十锦攒心盒子，自斟壶，岂不别致？”贾母听了，说：“很是。”即命人传与厨房：“明日就拣我们爱吃的东西做了，按着人数，再装了盒子来。早饭也摆在园里吃。”商议之间，早又掌灯，一夕无话。\n　　次日清早起来，可喜这日天气清朗。李纨清晨起来，看着老婆子丫头们扫那些落叶，并擦抹桌椅，预备茶酒器皿。只见丰儿带了刘老老板儿进来，说：“大奶奶倒忙的很。”李纨笑道：“我说你昨儿去不成，只忙着要去。”刘老老笑道：“老太太留下我，叫我也热闹一天去。”丰儿拿了几把大小钥匙，说道：“我们奶奶说了，外头的高几儿怕不够使，不如开了楼，把那收的拿下来使一天罢。奶奶原该亲自来，因和太太说话呢，请大奶奶开了，带着人搬罢。”李氏便命素云接了钥匙。又命婆子出去，把二门上小厮叫几个来。李氏站在大观楼下往上看着，命人上去开了缀锦阁，一张一张的往下抬。小厮、老婆子、丫头一齐动手，抬了二十多张下来。李纨道：“好生着，别慌慌张张鬼赶着似的，仔细碰了牙子！”又回头向刘老老笑道：“老老也上去瞧瞧。”刘老老听说，巴不得一声儿，拉了板儿登梯上去。进里面只见乌压压的堆着些围屏桌椅、大小花灯之类，虽不大认得，只见五彩闪灼，各有奇妙，念了几声佛便下来了。然后锁上门，一齐下来。李纨道：“恐怕老太太高兴，越发把船上划子、篙、桨、遮阳幔子，都搬下来预备着。”众人答应，又复开了门，色色的搬下来。命小厮传驾娘们，到船坞里撑两只船来。\n　　正乱着，只见贾母已带了一群人进来了，李纨忙迎上去，笑道：“老太太高兴，倒进来了，我只当还没梳头呢，才掐了菊花要送去。”一面说，一面碧月早已捧过一个大荷叶式的翡翠盘子来，里面养着各色折枝菊花。贾母便拣了一朵大红的簪在鬓上，因回头看见了刘老老，忙笑道：“过来带花儿。”一语末完，凤姐儿便拉过刘老老来，笑道：“让我打扮你。”说着，把一盘子花，横三竖四的插了一头。贾母和众人笑的了不得。刘老老也笑道：“我这头也不知修了什么福，今儿这样体面起来。”众人笑道：“你还不拔下来摔到他脸上呢，把你打扮的成了老妖精了。”刘老老笑道：“我虽老了，年轻时也风流，爱个花儿粉儿的，今儿索性作个老风流！”\n　　说话间，已来到沁芳亭上，丫鬟们抱了个大锦褥子来，铺在栏杆榻板上。贾母倚栏坐下，命刘老老也坐在旁边，因问他：“这园子好不好？”刘老老念佛说道：“我们乡下人，到了年下，都上城来买画儿贴。闲了的时候儿大家都说：‘怎么得到画儿上逛逛！’想着画儿也不过是假的，那里有这个真地方儿？谁知今儿进这园里一瞧，竟比画儿还强十倍！怎么得有人也照着这个园子画一张，我带了家去给他们见见，死了也得好处。”贾母听说，指着惜春笑道：“你瞧我这个小孙女儿，他就会画，等明儿叫他画一张如何？”刘老老听了，喜的忙跑过来拉着惜春，说道：“我的姑娘，你这么大年纪儿，又这么个好模样儿，还有这个能干，别是个神仙托生的罢？”贾母众人都笑了。\n　　歇了歇，又领着刘老老都见识见识。先到了潇湘馆。一进门，只见两边翠竹夹路，土地下苍苔布满。中间羊肠一条石子漫的甬路，刘老老让出来与贾母众人走，自己却走土地。琥珀拉他道：“老老你上来走，看青苔滑倒了。”刘老老道：“不相干，我们走熟了，姑娘们只管走罢。可惜你们的那鞋，别沾了泥。”他只顾上头和人说话，不防脚底下果踩滑了，“咕咚”一交跌倒，众人都拍手呵呵的大笑。贾母笑骂道：“小蹄子们，还不搀起来，只站着笑！”说话时，刘老老已爬起来了，自己也笑了，说道：“才说嘴，就打了嘴了。”贾母问他：“可扭了腰了没有？叫丫头们捶捶。”刘老老道：“那里说的我这么娇嫩了？那一天不跌两下子？都要捶起来，还了得呢。”\n紫鹃早打起湘帘，贾母等进来坐下。黛玉亲自用小茶盘儿捧了一盖碗茶来奉与贾母。王夫人道：“我们不吃茶，姑娘不用倒了。”黛玉听说，便命丫头把自己窗下常坐的一张椅子挪到下手，请王夫人坐了。刘老老因见窗下案上设着笔砚，又见书架上放着满满的书，刘老老道：“这必定是那一位哥儿的书房了？”贾母笑指黛玉道：“这是我这外孙女儿的屋子。”刘老老留神打量了黛玉一番，方笑道：“这那里象个小姐的绣房？竟比那上等的书房还好呢。”贾母因问：“宝玉怎么不见？”众丫头们答说：“在池子里船上呢。”贾母道：“谁又预备下船了？”李纨忙回说：“才开楼拿的。我恐怕老太太高兴，就预备下了。”贾母听了，方欲说话时，有人回说：“姨太太来了。”贾母等刚站起来，只见薛姨妈早进来了，一面归坐，笑道：“今儿老太太高兴，这早晚就来了。”贾母笑道：“我才说，来迟了的要罚他，不想姨太太就来迟了。”说笑一回。贾母因见窗上纱颜色旧了，便和王夫人说道：“这个纱新糊上好看，过了后儿就不翠了。这院子里头又没有个桃杏树，这竹子已是绿的，再拿绿纱糊上，反倒不配。我记得咱们先有四五样颜色糊窗的纱呢。明儿给他把这窗上的换了。”凤姐儿忙道：“昨儿我开库房，看见大板箱里还有好几匹银红蝉翼纱，也有各样折枝花样的，也有‘流云蝙蝠’花样的，也有‘百蝶穿花’花样的，颜色又鲜，纱又轻软，我竟没见这个样的，拿了两匹出来，做两床绵纱被，想来一定是好的。”\n    贾母听了笑道：“呸，人人都说你没有没经过没见过的，连这个纱还不能认得，明儿还说嘴。”薛姨妈等都笑说：“凭他怎么经过见过，怎么敢比老太太呢！老太太何不教导了他，连我们也听听。”凤姐儿也笑说：“好祖宗，教给我罢。”贾母笑向薛姨妈众人道：“那个纱，比你们的年纪还大呢，怪不得他认做蝉翼纱，原也有些象。不知道的都认做蝉翼纱。正经名字叫‘软烟罗’。”凤姐儿道：“这个名儿也好听，只是我这么大了，纱罗也见过几百样，从没听见过这个名色。”贾母笑道：“你能活了多大，见过几样东西，就说嘴来了。那个软烟罗只有四样颜色：一样雨过天青，一样秋香色，一样松绿的，一样就是银红的。要是做了帐子，糊了窗屉，远远的看着就和烟雾一样，所以叫做‘软烟罗’。那银红的又叫做‘霞影纱’。如今上用的府纱也没有这样软厚轻密的了。”\n薛姨妈笑道：“别说凤丫头没见，连我也没听见过。”凤姐儿一面说话，早命人取了一匹来了，贾母说：“可不是这个！先时原不过是糊窗屉，后来我们拿这做被做帐子试试，也竟好。明日就找出几匹来，拿银红的替他糊窗户。”凤姐答应着。众人看了，都称赞不已。刘老老也觑着眼看，口里不住的念佛，说道：“我们想做衣裳也不能，拿着糊窗子，岂不可惜？”贾母道：“倒是做衣裳不好看。”凤姐忙把自己身上穿的一件大红棉纱袄的襟子拉出来，向贾母薛姨妈道：“看我的这袄儿。”贾母、薛姨妈都说：“这也是上好的了，这是如今上用内造的，竟比不上这个。”凤姐儿道：“这个薄片子还说是内造上用呢，竟连这个官用的也比不上啊。”贾母道：“再找一找，只怕还有，要有就都拿出来，送这刘亲家两匹。有雨过天青的，我做一个帐子挂上。剩的配上里子，做些个夹坎肩儿给丫头们穿，白收着霉坏了。”凤姐儿忙答应了，仍命人送去。\n　　贾母便笑道：“这屋里窄，再往别处逛去罢。”刘老老笑道：“人人都说：‘大家子住大房。’昨儿见了老太太正房，配上大箱、大柜、大桌子、大床，果然威武。那柜子比我们一间房子还大还高。怪道后院子里有个梯子，我想又不上房晒东西，预备这梯子做什么？后来我想起来，一定是为开顶柜取东西，离了那梯子怎么上得去呢？如今又见了这小屋子，更比大的越发齐整了。满屋里东西都只好看，可不知叫什么。我越看越舍不得离了这里了！”凤姐道：“还有好的呢，我都带你去瞧瞧。”\n　　说着，一径离了潇湘馆，远远望见池中一群人在那里撑船。贾母道：“他们既备下船，咱们就坐一回。”说着，向紫菱洲蓼溆一带走来。未至池前，只见几个婆子手里都捧着一色摄丝戗俄金五彩大盒子走来，凤姐忙问王夫人：“早饭在那里摆？”王夫人道：“问老太太在那里就在那里罢了。”贾母听说，便回头说：“你三妹妹那里好，你就带了人摆去，我们从这里坐了船去。”凤姐儿听说，便回身和李纨、探春、鸳鸯、琥珀带着端饭的人等，抄着近路到了秋爽斋，就在晓翠堂上调开桌案。鸳鸯笑道：“天天咱们说外头老爷们吃酒吃饭，都有个凑趣儿的，拿他取笑儿。咱们今儿也得了个女清客了。”李纨是个厚道人，倒不理会；凤姐儿却听着是说刘老老，便笑道：“咱们今儿就拿他取个笑儿。”二人便如此这般商议。李纨笑劝道：“你们一点好事儿不做。又不是个小孩儿，还这么淘气，仔细老太太说！”鸳鸯笑道：“很不与大奶奶相干，有我呢。”\n　　正说着，只见贾母等来了，各自随便坐下。先有丫鬟挨人递了茶。大家吃毕，凤姐手里拿着西洋布手巾，裹着一把乌木三镶银箸，按席摆下。贾母因说：“把那一张小楠木桌子抬过来，让刘亲家挨着我这边坐。”众人听说，忙抬过来。凤姐一面递眼色与鸳鸯，鸳鸯便忙拉刘老老出去，悄悄的嘱咐了刘老老一席话，又说：“这是我们家的规矩，要错了，我们就笑话呢。”调停巳毕，然后归坐。薛姨妈是吃过饭来的，不吃了，只坐在一边吃茶。贾母带着宝玉、湘云、黛玉、宝钗一桌，王夫人带着迎春姐妹三人一桌，刘老老挨着贾母一桌。贾母素日吃饭，皆有小丫鬟在旁边拿着漱盂、麈尾、巾帕之物，如今鸳鸯是不当这差的了，今日偏接过麈尾来拂着。丫鬟们知他要捉弄刘老老，便躲开让他。鸳鸯一面侍立，一面递眼色。刘老老道：“姑娘放心。”\n　　那刘老老入了坐，拿起箸来，沉甸甸的不伏手，原是凤姐和鸳鸯商议定了，单拿了一双老年四楞象牙镶金的筷子给刘老老。刘老老见了，说道：“这个叉巴子，比我们那里的铁锨还沉，那里拿的动他？”说的众人都笑起来。只见一个媳妇端了一个盒子站在当地，一个丫鬟上来揭去盒盖，里面盛着两碗菜，李纨端了一碗放在贾母桌上，凤姐偏拣了一碗鸽子蛋放在刘老老桌上。贾母这边说声“请”，刘老老便站起身来，高声说道：“老刘，老刘，食量大如牛。吃个老母猪不抬头！”说完，却鼓着腮帮子，两眼直视，一声不语。众人先还发怔，后来一想，上上下下都一齐哈哈大笑起来。湘云掌不住，一口茶都喷出来。黛玉笑岔了气，伏着桌子只叫“嗳哟”。宝玉滚到贾母怀里，贾母笑的搂着叫“心肝”。王夫人笑的用手指着凤姐儿，却说不出话来。薛姨妈也掌不住，口里的茶喷了探春一裙子。探春的茶碗都合在迎春身上。惜春离了坐位，拉着他奶母叫“揉揉肠子”。地下无一个不弯腰屈背，也有躲出去蹲着笑去的，也有忍着笑上来替他姐妹换衣裳的。独有凤姐、鸳鸯二人掌着，还只管让刘老老。\n　　刘老老拿起箸来，只觉不听使，又道：“这里的鸡儿也俊，下的这蛋也小巧，怪俊的。我且得一个儿！”众人方住了笑，听见这话，又笑起来。贾母笑的眼泪出来只忍不住，琥珀在后捶着。贾母笑道：“这定是凤丫头促狭鬼儿闹的，快别信他的话了。”那刘老老正夸鸡蛋小巧，凤姐儿笑道：“一两银子一个呢，你快尝尝罢，冷了就不好吃了。”刘老老便伸筷子要夹，那里夹的起来？满碗里闹了一阵，好容易撮起一个来，才伸着脖子要吃，偏又滑下来，滚在地下。忙放下筷子要亲自去拣，早有地下的人拣出去了，刘老老叹道：“一两银子，也没听见个响声儿就没了！”  　　众人已没心吃饭，都看着他取笑。贾母又说：“谁这会子又把那个筷子拿出来了，又不请客摆大筵席！都是凤丫头支使的，还不换了呢。”地下的人原不曾预备这牙箸，本是凤姐和鸳鸯拿了来了的，听如此说，忙收过去了，也照样换上一双乌木镶银的。刘老老道：“去了金的，又是银的，到底不及俺们那个伏手。”凤姐儿道：“菜里要有毒，这银子下去了就试的出来。”刘老老道：“这个菜里有毒，我们那些都成了砒霜了！那怕毒死了，也要吃尽了。”贾母见他如此有趣，吃的又香甜，把自己的菜也都端过来给他吃。又命一个老嬷嬷来，将各样的菜给板儿夹在碗上。  　　一时吃毕，贾母等都往探春卧室中去闲话，这里收拾残桌，又放了一桌。刘老老看着李纨与凤姐儿对坐着吃饭，叹道：“别的罢了，我只爱你们家这行事，怪道说，‘礼出大家’。”凤姐儿忙笑道：“你可别多心，才刚不过大家取乐儿。”一言未了，鸳鸯也进来笑道：“老老别恼，我给你老人家赔个不是儿罢。”刘老老忙笑道：“姑娘说那里的话？咱们哄着老太太开个心儿，有什么恼的！你先嘱咐我，我就明白了，不过大家取笑儿。我要恼，也就不说了。”鸳鸯便骂人：“为什么不倒茶给老老吃！”刘老老忙道：“才刚那个嫂子倒了茶来，我吃过了，姑娘也该用饭了。”凤姐儿便拉鸳鸯坐下道：“你和我们吃罢，省了回来又闹。”鸳鸯便坐下了，婆子们添上碗箸来，三人吃毕。刘老老笑道：“我看你们这些人，都只吃这一点儿就完了，亏你们也不饿。怪道风儿都吹的倒。”鸳鸯便问：“今儿剩的不少，都那里去了？”婆子们道：“都还没散呢，在这里等着，一齐散给他们吃。”鸳鸯道：“他们吃不了这些，挑两碗给二奶奶屋里平丫头送去。”凤姐道：“他早吃了饭了，不用给他。”鸳鸯道：“他吃不了，喂你的猫。”婆子听了，忙拣了两样，拿盒子送去。鸳鸯道：“素云那里去了？”李纨道：“他们都在这里一处吃，又找他做什么？”鸳鸯道：“这就罢了。”凤姐道：“袭人不在这里，你倒是叫人送两样给他去。”鸳鸯听说，便命人也送两样去。鸳鸯又问婆子们：“回来吃酒的攒盒，可装上了？”婆子道：“想必还得一会子。”鸳鸯道：“催着些儿。”婆子答应了。\n　　凤姐等来至探春房中，只见他娘儿们正说笑。探春素喜阔朗，这三间屋子并不曾隔断，当地放着一张花梨大理石大案，案上堆着各种名人法帖，并数十方宝砚，各色笔筒，笔海内插的笔如树林一般。那一边设着斗大的一个汝窑花囊，插着满满的一囊水晶球的白菊。西墙上当中挂着一大幅米襄阳《烟雨图》。左右挂着一副对联，乃是颜鲁公墨迹。其联云：\n　　烟霞闲骨格；泉石野生涯。\n案上设着大鼎，左边紫檀架上放着一个大官窑的大盘，盘内盛着数十个娇黄玲珑大佛手。右边洋漆架上悬着一个白玉比目磬，旁边挂着小槌。那板儿略熟了些，便要摘那槌子去击，丫鬟们忙拦住他，他又要那佛手吃，探春拣了一个给他，说：“玩罢，吃不得的。”东边便设着卧榻拔步床，上悬着葱绿双绣花卉草虫的纱帐。板儿又跑来看，说：“这是蝈蝈，这是蚂蚱。”刘老老忙打了他一巴掌，道：“下作黄子，没干没净的乱闹。倒叫你进来瞧瞧，就上脸了！”打的板儿哭起来，众人忙劝解方罢。\n　　贾母隔着纱窗后往院内看了一回，因说道：“后廊檐下的梧桐也好了，只是细些。”正说话，忽一阵风过，隐隐听得鼓乐之声。贾母问：“是谁家娶亲呢？这里临街倒近。”王夫人等笑回道：“街上的那里听的见？这是咱们的那十来个女孩子们演习吹打呢。”贾母便笑道：“既他们演，何不叫他们进来演习，他们也逛一逛，咱们也乐了，不好吗？”凤姐听说，忙命人出去叫来，赶着吩咐摆下条桌，铺上红毡子。贾母道：“就铺排在藕香榭的水亭子上，借着水音更好听。回来咱们就在缀锦阁底下吃酒，又宽阔，又听的近。”众人都说好。贾母向薛姨妈笑道：“咱们走罢，他们姐妹们都不大喜欢人来，生怕腌了屋子。咱们别没眼色儿，正经坐会子船，喝酒去罢。”说着，大家起身便走。探春笑道：“这是那里的话？求着老太太、姨妈、太太来坐坐还不能呢！”贾母笑道：“我的这三丫头倒好，只有两个玉儿可恶。回来喝醉了，咱们偏往他们屋里闹去！”说着众人都笑了。\n　　一齐出来走不多远，已到了荇叶渚，那姑苏选来的几个驾娘早把两只棠木舫撑来。众人扶了贾母、王夫人、薛姨妈、刘老老、鸳鸯、玉钏儿上了这一只船，次后李纨跟上去。凤姐也上去，立在船头上，也要撑船。贾母在舱内道：“那不是玩的！虽不是河里，也有好深的，你快给我进来。”凤姐笑道：“怕什么！老祖宗只管放心。”说着，便一篙点开，到了池当中。船小人多，凤姐只觉乱晃，忙把篙子递与驾娘，方蹲下去。然后迎春姐妹等并宝玉上了那只，随后跟来。其馀老嬷嬷众丫鬟俱沿河随行。宝玉道：“这些破荷叶可恨，怎么还不叫人来拔去？”宝钗笑道：“今年这几日，何曾饶了这园子闲了一闲，天天逛，那里还有叫人来收拾的工夫呢？”黛玉道：“我最不喜欢李义山的诗，只喜他这一句：‘留得残荷听雨声。’偏你们又不留着残荷了。”宝玉道：“果然好句，以后咱们别叫拨去了。”\n　　说着已到了花溆的萝港之下，觉得阴森透骨，两滩上衰草残菱，更助秋兴。贾母因见岸上的清厦旷朗，便问：“这是薛姑娘的屋子不是？”众人道：“是”，贾母忙命拢岸，顺着云步石梯上去，一同进了蘅芜院。只觉异香扑鼻，那些奇草仙藤，愈冷愈苍翠，都结了实，似珊瑚豆子一般，累垂可爱。及进了房屋，雪洞一般，一色的玩器全无。案上止有一个土定瓶，瓶中供着数枝菊，并两部书，茶奁、茶杯而已。床上只吊着青纱帐坦，衾褥也十分朴素。贾母叹道：“这孩子太老实了，你没有陈设，何妨和你姨娘要些。我也没理论，也没想到，你们的东西，自然在家里没带了来。”说着，命鸳鸯去取些古董来，又嗔着凤姐儿：“不送些玩器来给你妹妹，这样小器！”王夫人凤姐等都笑回说：“他自己不要么，我们原送了来，都退回去了。”薛姨妈也笑说道：“他在家里也不大弄这些东西。”贾母摇头道：“那使不得。虽然他省事，倘或来个亲戚，看着不象，二则年轻的姑娘们，屋里这么素净，也忌讳。我们这老婆子，越发该住马圈去了。你们听那些书上戏上说的小姐们的绣房，精致的还了得呢！他们姐妹们虽不敢比那些小姐们，也别很离了格儿。有现成的东西，为什么不摆呢？要很爱素净，少几样倒使得。我最会收拾屋子，如今老了，没这个闲心了。他们姐妹们也还学着收拾的好。只怕俗气，有好东西也摆坏了。我看他们还不俗。如今等我替你收拾，包管又大方又素净。我的两件体己，收到如今，没给宝玉看见过，若经了他的眼也没了。”说着，叫过鸳鸯来，吩咐道：“你把那石头盆景儿和那架纱照屏，还有个墨烟冻石鼎拿来，这三样摆在这案上就够了。再把那水墨字画白绫帐子拿来，把这帐子也换了。”鸳鸯答应着，笑道：“这些东西都搁在东楼上不知那个箱于里，还得慢慢找去，明儿再拿去也罢了。”贾母道：“明日后日都使得，只别忘了。”\n　　说着，坐了一回，方出来，一径来至缀锦阁下。文官等上来请过安，因问：“演习何曲？”贾母道：“只拣你们熟的演习几套罢。”文官等下来，往藕香榭去不提。这里凤姐已带着人摆设齐整，上面左右两张榻，榻上都铺着锦蓉簟，每一榻前两张雕漆几，也有海棠式的，也有梅花式的，也有荷叶式的，也有葵花式的，也有方的，有圆的，其式不一。一个上头放着一分炉瓶，一个攒盒。上面二榻四几，是贾母、薛姨妈；下面一椅两几，是王夫人的。馀者都是一椅一几。东边刘老老，刘老老之下便是王夫人。西边便是湘云，第二便是宝钗，第三便是黛玉，第四迎春、探春、惜春挨次排下去，宝玉在末。李纨凤姐二人之几设于三层槛内、二层纱厨之外。攒盒式样，亦随几之式样。每人一把乌银洋錾自斟壶，一个十锦珐琅杯。\n　　大家坐定，贾母先笑道：“咱们先吃两杯，今日也行一个令，才有意思。”薛姨妈笑说道：“老太太自然有好酒令，我们如何会呢，安心叫我们醉了。我们都多吃两杯就有了。”贾母笑道：“姨太太今儿也过谦起来，想是厌我老了。”薛姨妈笑道：“不是谦，只怕行不上来，倒是笑话了。”王夫人忙笑道：“便说不上来，只多吃了一杯酒，醉了睡觉去，还有谁笑话咱们不成。”薛姨妈点头笑道：“依令，老太太到底吃一杯令酒才是。”贾母笑道：“这个自然。”说着便吃了一杯。凤姐儿忙走至当地，笑道：“既行令，还叫鸳鸯姐姐来行才好。”众人都知贾母所行之令，必得鸳鸯提着，故听了这话都说很是。凤姐便拉着鸳鸯过来。王夫人笑道：“既在令内，没有站着的理。”回头命小丫头子：“端一张椅子，放在你二位奶奶的席上。”鸳鸯也半推半就，谢了坐便坐下，也吃了一钟酒，笑道：“酒令大如军令。不论尊卑，惟我是主，违了我的话，是要受罚的。”王夫人等都笑道：“一定如此，快些说。”鸳鸯未开口，刘老老便下席，摆手道：“别这样捉弄人！我家去了。”众人都笑道：“这却使不得。”鸳鸯喝令小丫头子们：“拉上席去！”小丫头子们也笑着，果然拉入席中。刘老老只叫：“饶了我罢！”鸳鸯道：“再多言的罚一壶。”刘老老方住了。\n　　鸳鸯道：“如今我说骨牌副儿，从老太太起，顺领下去，至刘老老止。比如我说一副儿，将这三张牌拆开，先说头一张，再说第二张，说完了，合成这一副儿的名字，无论诗词歌赋，成语俗话，比上一句，都要合韵。错了的罚一杯。”众人笑道：“这个令好，就说出来。”\n　　鸳鸯道：“有了一副了。左边是张天。”贾母道：“头上有青天。”众人道好。鸳鸯道：“当中是个五合六。”贾母道：“六桥梅花香彻骨。”鸳鸯道：“剩了一张六合么。”贾母道：“一轮红日出云霄。”鸳鸯道：“凑成却是个‘蓬头鬼’。”贾母道：“这鬼抱住钟馗腿。”说完，大家笑着喝彩。贾母饮了一杯。\n　　鸳鸯又道：“又有一副了。左边是个大长五。”薛姨妈道：“梅花朵朵风前舞。”鸳鸯道：“右边是个大五长。”薛姨妈道：“十月梅花岭上香。”鸳鸯道：“当中二五是杂七。”薛姨妈道：“织女牛郎会七夕。”鸳鸯道：“凑成‘二郎游五岳’。”薛姨妈道：“世人不及神仙乐。”说完，大家称赏，饮了酒。\n　　鸳鸯又道：“有了一副了。左边长么两点明。”湘云道：“双悬日月照乾坤。”鸳鸯道：“右边长么两点明。”湘云道：“闲花落地听无声。”鸳鸯道：“中间还得么四来。”湘云道：“日边红杏倚云栽。”鸳鸯道：“凑成一个‘樱桃九熟’。”湘云道：“御园却被鸟衔出。”说完，饮了一杯。\n　　鸳鸯道：“有了一副了。左边是长三。”宝钗道：“双双燕子语梁间。”鸳鸯道：“右边是三长。”宝钗道：“水荇牵风翠带长。”鸳鸯道：“当中三六九点在。”宝钗道：“三山半落青天外。”鸳鸯道：“凑成‘铁锁练孤舟’。”宝钗道：“处处风波处处愁。”说完饮毕。\n　　鸳鸯又道：“左边一个天。”黛玉道：“良辰美景奈何天。”宝钗听了，回头看着他，黛玉只顾怕罚，也不理论。鸳鸯道：“中间锦屏颜色俏。”黛玉道：“纱窗也没有红娘报。”鸳鸯道：“剩了二六八点齐。”黛玉道：“双瞻玉座引朝仪。”鸳鸯道：“凑成‘篮子’好采花。”黛玉道：“仙杖香挑芍药花。”说完，饮了一口。\n　　鸳鸯道：“左边四五成花九。”迎春道：“桃花带雨浓。”众人笑道：“该罚！错了韵，而且又不象。”迎春笑着，饮了一口。\n原是凤姐和鸳鸯都要听刘老老的笑话儿，故意都叫说错了。至王夫人，鸳鸯便代说了一个，下便该刘老老。刘老老道：“我们庄家闲了，也常会几个人弄这个儿，可不象这么好听就是了。少不得我也试试。”众人都笑道：“容易的，你只管说，不相干。”鸳鸯笑道：“左边大四是个人。”刘老老听了，想了半日，说道：“是个庄家人罢！”众人哄堂笑了。贾母笑道：“说的好，就是这么说。”刘老老也笑道：“我们庄家人不过是现成的本色儿，姑娘姐姐别笑。”鸳鸯道：“中间三四绿配红。”刘老老道：“大火烧了毛毛虫。”众人笑道：“这是有的，还说你的本色。”鸳鸯笑道：“右边么四真好看。”刘老老道：“一个萝卜一头蒜。”众人又笑了。鸳鸯笑道：“凑成便是‘一枝花’。”刘老老两只手比着，也要笑，却又掌住了，说道：“花儿落了结个大倭瓜。”众人听了，由不的大笑起来。\n只听外面乱嚷嚷的，不知何事，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Baoyu hurried in at this message and found Hu-po standing by the screen.\n\n“Do go quickly,” she said. “They’re waiting for you.”\n\nHe went to the Lady Dowager’s apartments, where she was consulting with Lady Wang and the girls about the return feast for Hsiang-yun.\n\n“I’ve an idea,” he announced. “As there’ll be no outsiders, let’s not have a set menu but just the dishes we like. And instead of a feast, let each have a small table by her with one or two favourite dishes as well as a hamper of assorted delicacies and a pot of wine. Wouldn’t that be original?”\n\n“Excellent!” The old lady ordered this to be relayed to the kitchen. “Tomorrow we’ll have the dishes we like, one hamper for each person, and breakfast in the Garden too.”\n\nThey went on chatting until the lamps were lit, and nothing more happened that evening.\n\nThe next day dawned bright and clear. Li Wan rose early and was supervising the old serving-women and maids sweeping up the fallen leaves, dusting the tables and chairs, and preparing the tea-things and wine vessels when Feng-erh came in with Granny Liu.\n\n“You’re busy, madam,” said the old woman.\n\n“I said you wouldn’t be able to go yesterday, you were so set on leaving,” replied Li Wan.\n\n“The old lady kept me to have some fun today.”\n\nFeng-erh produced some keys of different sizes.\n\n“My mistress says that as there may not be enough small tables outside, we’d better open the storehouse and use the ones kept there for the day. She’d have come herself but she’s with Her Ladyship, so will you please open up, madam, and get people to carry them down?”\n\nLi Wan told Su-yun to take the keys and send some old women to summon some pages from the inner gate. Then she stood below the Tower of Variegated Splendour to supervise the opening of the storehouse above and the carrying down of the tables one by one. Young servants, old women and maids joined forces to carry down more than twenty.\n\n“Be careful now,” warned Li Wan. “Don’t rush and bump into each other like demons snapping at your heels. Mind you don’t chip the inlaid work.”\n\nShe turned to grin at Granny Liu. “Would you like to go up and have a look?”\n\nThe old woman was only too glad to do so and, taking Pan-erh by the hand, climbed the ladder. Inside the store-room were stacks of tables, chairs, screens and lanterns large and small, all brightly coloured and splendid, though she could not identify all the objects. She exclaimed in admiration and came down again. Then the door was locked and they all descended.\n\n“If the old lady’s in good spirits, we may need the punts, punting-poles, oars and awnings from the boats,” said Li Wan. “Better have them fetched too.”\n\nAt her order the door was opened again and all these things were carried down. She sent pages to tell the matrons in charge of the boats to punt two of them over.\n\nIn the midst of this bustle in came the Lady Dowager with her attendants. Li Wan went forward to meet them.\n\n“So you’re in high spirits and have come, madam,” she said with a smile. “I thought you’d still be doing your hair, and was just going to send you some chrysanthemums.”\n\nAs she spoke Pi-yueh brought in an emerald plate in the shape of a lotus leaf, containing a dozen or so sprays of chrysanthemums of different varieties. The old lady chose a large red one to tuck in her hair, then noticing Granny Liu she cried:\n\n“Come over here and have a flower.”\n\nBefore the words were out of her mouth, Hsi-feng pulled Granny Liu forward.\n\n“Let me deck you out,” she said.\n\nShe stuck flowers all over the old woman’s head.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the rest were convulsed.\n\n“I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this,” cackled Granny Liu. “Making such a fine lady of me today!”\n\n“You should pull them off and throw them in her face,” they teased. “She’s made you look like an old witch.”\n\n“I may be old now, but I was a gay young dog in my time,” rejoined the old woman. “I loved flowers too, and would often stick some in my hair. But now, what with my hard life, I’ve lost the taste for it. But since you’re so good to me, madam, I’ll make the most of it today.”\n\nShe’s fond of flowers and rouge, so today let’s be an old roue!”\n\nBy now they had reached Seeping Fragrance Pavilion. The maids spread a big silk cushion on the bench by the railing, and the Lady Dowager leaning on the rail sat down and told Granny Liu to sit beside her.\n\n“How do you like this garden?” she asked.\n\n“We country folk come to town at New Year to buy pictures,” answered the old woman. “And when we’re at home we often say, ‘How can we go for a stroll in those pictures?’ Fancy a place like this really existing! Why, this garden’s better than any picture! I wish someone would paint me a picture of it to take home. Then I could show it to the others and not have lived in vain.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager pointed at Xichun.\n\n“See that young granddaughter of mine?” she chuckled. “She can paint. Suppose we get her to do a painting for you tomorrow?”\n\nGranny Liu hurried over to Xichun.\n\n“So young and pretty,” she cried, “and such a clever painter too! You must be an angel!”\n\nThis set everybody laughing.\n\nAfter a little rest the Lady Dowager took her guest to see other parts of the garden. Their first stop was Bamboo Lodge. As they entered the gate they were confronted by green bamboos lining a path paved with pebbles which wound between them. Moss covered the ground on both sides. Granny Liu made way for the Lady Dowager and the rest to walk on the pebbles while she walked on the moss.\n\n“Come up here, granny,” cried Amber, taking her arm. “It’s slippery there.”\n\n“No, it’s all right. I’m used to walking like this. You young ladies must take care not to get your silken shoes muddy.”\n\nBut even as she spoke she slipped and with a thud fell flat. All clapped their hands and laughed.\n\nThe Lady Dowager scolded, “Help her up, you hussies. Don’t just stand there laughing.”\n\nAs they hurried to help her up, Granny Liu was already scrambling to her feet.\n\n“It’s my own fault for bragging,” she chuckled. “I’m not too old to need a hand.”\n\n“Did you sprain your back?” asked the Lady Dowager. “Let the maids massage it for you.”\n\n“Heaven forbid!” cried Granny Liu. “I’m not as delicate as that. Why, if I fell over every day I’d need massaging all the time!”\n\nZijuan had already raised the portiere, and when the Lady Dowager and the others entered and sat down Daiyu brought her grandmother a small tray with a covered bowl of tea on it.\n\n“We won’t any tea, thanks,” said Lady Wang. “You needn’t have troubled, child.”\n\nDaiyu then ordered a maid to put her usual chair by the window and invite Lady Wang to sit there.\n\nGranny Liu noticed a writing-brush and inkstone on the desk under the window, and the book-shelf filled with books.\n\n“This must be the young gentleman’s study,” she remarked.\n\nThe Lady Dowager smiled and pointed at Daiyu.\n\n“This is my granddaughter’s room.”\n\nThe old woman looked hard at Daiyu.\n\n“Doesn’t look like a young lady’s room,” she commented. “Why, it’s finer than any scholar’s study!”\n\n“Where is Baoyu?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“In the boat on the lake,” the maids told her.\n\n“Who got the boat ready?” she asked.\n\n“It was brought out just now when we opened the Provisional Palace,” Li Wan informed her. “I thought you might like a trip, madam, so I had it prepared.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager was about to say something when she was interrupted by the announcement that Aunt Xue had arrived. As the others rose to their feet, Aunt Xue came in.\n\n“So you’ve come so early today, sister,” she said with a smile. “You must be in good spirits.”\n\n“I was just saying that late-comers should be punished,” replied the Lady Dowager. “I didn’t expect you to be the one to come late.”\n\nNoticing that the gauze on the windows had faded, she remarked to Lady Wang, “This gauze looks good when it’s new, but after a time it loses its freshness. There are no peach or apricot trees in this court, and the bamboos are green, so green gauze doesn’t show up well either. As I recall, we have four or five other kinds of coloured gauze for windows. We must have this changed tomorrow.”\n\nXifeng put in, “I was opening the store-house yesterday and noticed several rolls of cicada-wing gauze in vermilion, some with designs of flowers on branches, others with cloud and bat motifs or butterflies among flowers. They’re splendid colours and as light as cicadas’ wings — I’ve never seen the like before. I took out two rolls to have two coverlets made of wadded gauze. I’m sure they’ll be good.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager chuckled, “Everyone says you’re an experienced person, yet here’s something you don’t recognize. Aren’t you ashamed to show your ignorance? You’ll be boasting again next time you see something.”\n\nAunt Xue and the others laughed.\n\n“However much she’s seen and experienced, how can she compare with an old lady like you?” they said. “Do tell her what this is, so that we can learn too.”\n\n“Do tell me, Old Ancestress,” begged Xifeng.\n\nThe old lady turned with a smile to Aunt Xue and the rest. “That gauze is even older than any of you. No wonder she took it for cicada-wing gauze; it is rather like it, and people who don’t know call it that. Its real name is soft-mist silk.”\n\n“What a pretty name!” exclaimed Xifeng. “But though I’m no longer young and have seen several hundred kinds of silk and gauze, I’ve never heard that name before.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager laughed. “How many years have you lived? How many things have you seen that you talk so big? Soft-mist silk comes in only four colours: light blue after rain, russet green, pine green and pink. Used for bed-curtains or window gauze, it looks from a distance like mist, and that’s how it got its name. The pink kind is also called ‘rosy cloud gauze.’ Nowadays the silk used in the Palace isn’t as soft or close-textured as this.”\n\n“Not only has Xifeng never seen it, I’d never even heard of it,” said Aunt Xue.\n\nXifeng had already sent a maid to fetch a roll.\n\n“This is it,” declared the Lady Dowager. “At first we just used it for window gauze, but later we tried making coverlets and bed-curtains from it, and that turned out well too. Tomorrow, find some of the pink kind and have his windows re-covered with that.”\n\nXifeng assented. The others were loud in their admiration. Granny Liu was peering at the silk too, exclaiming “Amida Buddha!”\n\n“We couldn’t afford to make clothes out of this,” she cried. “What a shame to use it for windows!”\n\n“Actually it doesn’t look well made into clothes,” said the old lady.\n\nXifeng promptly pulled out the lapel of the red gauze tunic she was wearing.\n\n“Look at this jacket of mine,” she said.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and Aunt Xue agreed, “That’s very fine too. It’s the best Imperial silk, but it can’t compare with that other.”\n\n“This thin stuff is called Imperial silk,” said Xifeng, “but actually it’s not as good as the silk sold by provincial officials.”\n\n“You must look for some more,” said the Lady Dowager. “If there is any, bring it all out. We’ll give this relative of ours two rolls. If there’s any of the light blue, I’ll have a bed-curtain made. The rest can be lined and made into jackets for the maids. It’s a pity to leave it stored away till it gets moth-eaten.”\n\nXifung promised to see to this and gave orders for the silk to be taken back.\n\n“This room is rather cramped,” remarked the Lady Dowager. “Let’s go somewhere else.”\n\n“They all say, ‘Big families have big houses,’” chuckled Granny Liu. “Yesterday I saw your main rooms, Old lady, with their big chests, big wardrobes and big tables.\n\nThe bed was huge and imposing, and the wardrobe was even larger and higher than a whole room in our place. So that’s why there’s a ladder in the back yard! I wondered what it was for — not for climbing up to the roof to dry things, surely? Now I realize it must be to get things down from the top of this wardrobe. How else could anyone reach up there? But this little room is even daintier than the big one. And everything in it is so pretty. I don’t know what any of it’s called. The more I see, the less I feel like leaving.”\n\n“There are better places yet,” Xifeng told her. “I’ll take you to see them.”\n\nShe led the way out of Bamboo Lodge and they saw in the distance a number of women punting boats on the lake.\n\n“As they’ve got the boats ready, let’s go for a row,” proposed the Lady Dowager.\n\nShe headed for the region of Purple Caltrop Isle and Smartweed Bank, but before they reached the lake they saw some serving-women approaching with big round boxes inlaid with gold.\n\n“Where shall we serve lunch, madam?” Xifeng asked Lady Wang.\n\n“Wherever the old lady fancies,” was the answer.\n\nHearing this, the Lady Dowager turned to say, “San’s place is nice. Take the servants there to lay the meal while we go by boat.”\n\nXifeng accordingly turned back and with Li Wan, Tanchun, Yuanyang and Hupo led the serving-women by a short cut to the Studio of Autumn Freshness, where she had the tables and chairs arranged in the Hall of Misty Rain.\n\n“We’re always saying that when the gentlemen give parties outside they have a sponger there to make fun of,” chuckled Yuanyang. “Now we’ve got a female sponger.”\n\nToo good-natured to see what she was driving at, Li Wan paid no attention; but Xifeng, realizing she meant Granny Liu, laughed.\n\n“Yes, let’s have some fun with her today,” she agreed.\n\nThe two of them put their heads together and worked out a plot.\n\n“You’re up to no good, as usual,” protested Li Wan with a smile. “Don’t be so mischievous. She’s not a child, you know. Be careful the old lady doesn’t scold you.”\n\n“This is none of your business, madam,” retorted Yuanyang. “I’ll take the responsibility.”\n\nAs they were talking the Lady Dowager arrived with the others and they all took seats as they pleased. Maids served tea, and when they had finished Xifeng laid out the table setting, holding in one hand a Western linen napkin in which were wrapped a pair of ebony chopsticks inlaid with silver.\n\n“Fetch that small nanmu table over here for Granny Liu to sit by me,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\nThe servants hastily did so. Xifeng winked at Yuanyang, who promptly took Granny Liu outside and whispered some instructions to her, adding, “This is the rule in our family. If you forget, we shall laugh at you.”\n\nWhen all was ready they took their seats. Aunt Xue, who had already eaten, did not join them but sat drinking tea on one side while the Lady Dowager sat at a table with Baoyu, Xiangyun, Daiyu and Baochai. Lady Wang sat at another with Yingchun and her two sisters. Granny Liu was given the place of honour next to the Lady Dowager.\n\nUsually when the old lady had a meal, maids stood beside her with a rinsing bowl, whisk and napkin, but Yuanyang was no longer on such duty. Today, however, she took the whisk. The other maids, knowing that she meant to play a trick on Granny Liu, made way for her. As she stood there waiting on them, Yuanyang winked at the old woman.\n\n“Don’t you worry, miss,” said Granny Liu.\n\nShe sat down and picked up her chopsticks. They were so heavy and clumsy she could hardly manage them. This was because Xifeng and Yuanyang had agreed to give her an old pair of ivory chopsticks inlaid with gold, of the squared sort used by the elderly.\n\n“These forks are heavier than the iron shovels in our place,” remarked Granny Liu. “How can I handle them?”\n\nThis set the whole table laughing. Then a matron who was standing in the courtyard with a box signalled to a maid, who lifted its lid.\n\nAfter two dishes had been served, Li Wan took one and put it on the Lady Dowager’s table, while Xifeng deliberately chose a dish of pigeon’s eggs for Granny Liu.\n\nAt a signal from the Lady Dowager they started eating. Granny Liu stood up then and declaimed loudly, “Old Liu, old Liu, your appetite’s as big as a cow. At one gulp you can swill a bucket of wine, then eat a whole sow — head lifted to do honour to the toast.” Then she puffed out her cheeks and stared in silence.\n\nThe others had been staggered at first, but this set the whole table laughing. Xiangyun shook so uncontrollably that she sputtered out the tea she had in her mouth, while Daiyu nearly choked and collapsed over the table gasping. Baoyu fell convulsively into his grandmother’s arms and she chuckled as she hugged him, calling him “my precious heart.” Lady Wang wagged one finger at Xifeng but was laughing too much to speak. Aunt Xue, too, exploded in such mirth that she sprayed tea all over Tanchun’s skirt, making Tanchun upset the tea in her own bowl over Yingchun, while Xichun left her seat and begged her nurse to rub her stomach for her.\n\nThe servants as well were doubled up, while some squatted down to laugh, others smothered their laughter as they changed their young mistresses’ clothes. Xifeng and Yuanyang were the only ones who kept straight faces as they urged Granny Liu to eat.\n\nShe picked up her chopsticks but, being unused to the slippery ebony ones, could not manage them.\n\n“The hens here are so refined,” she remarked, “I see they lay such dainty eggs. Very pretty. I must try one.”\n\nThis set everyone off again. The Lady Dowager was laughing so much that tears ran down her cheeks. Amber behind her was pummelling her back.\n\n“It’s that wicked Xifeng’s doing,” gasped the old lady. “Don’t believe a word she says.”\n\nGranny Liu was praising the appearance of the eggs when Xifeng put in, “They cost one tael of silver apiece. Try one quick before they get cold.”\n\nGranny Liu reached out with her chopsticks but could not pick one up. After chasing the egg all round the bowl she finally got it — only to drop it on the table when she tried to put it in her mouth. “A tael of silver doesn’t buy so much as a squeak,” she fussed.\n\nBy now the others had no heart for eating, they were so amused watching her. The Lady Dowager told the servants, “Take those chopsticks away. We’re not having a big banquet, so who told you to give her those?” The servants, who had not provided these ebony chopsticks but had received them from Xifeng and Yuanyang, hastily changed them for an ordinary pair of ivory ones inlaid with silver.\n\n“The gold ones are gone, now we’ve got silver ones,” said Granny Liu. “But they’re still not so handy as our wooden ones.”\n\n“If there’s poison in the food,” Xifeng told her, “the silver will show it.”\n\n“If this food is poisoned, then what we eat must be arsenic,” retorted the old woman. “I mean to eat my fill, even if it kills me.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager, amused by her rustic ways and pleased to see how she was enjoying the food, gave orders that some of her own dishes should be taken to Granny Liu, and she told an old nurse to put different dishes in Ban’er’s bowl.\n\nAfter the meal, when the Lady Dowager and the rest had gone to Tanchun’s bedroom to chat, the tables were cleared and another laid. Granny Liu watched Li Wan and Xifeng having their meal at it.\n\n“No wonder the saying is ‘Great families have great courtesy,’” she observed with a sigh. “I like the way things are done here.”\n\n“Don’t be annoyed,” said Xifeng quickly. “We were just having some fun.”\n\nYuanyang had come in too. “Don’t be cross, granny,” she said. “Let me apologize for our fun.”\n\n“What are you talking about, miss?” The old woman smiled. “We were just trying to amuse the old lady.”\n\n‘If you’d told me beforehand, I’d have known what to expect and not made a fool of myself,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But if I’d been angry, I wouldn’t have said anything.’\n\nFaithful rounded on the other maids.\n\n‘Why hasn’t anyone given Grannie a cup of tea yet?’\n\n‘Oh, one of the women brought me one just now,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘I’ve already drunk it. But you ought to be having your dinner now, Miss.’\n\nXi-feng pulled Faithful down on the chair beside her.\n\n‘Sit down and eat with us. It will save you from having to go back and eat later.’\n\nFaithful sat down, and the women brought her a bowl and chopsticks. When the three of them had finished eating, Grannie Liu observed them with a smile.\n\n‘I must say, it’s a wonder you don’t feel hungry, the little bit you people eat! No wonder you’re all so thin and the wind could blow you over!’\n\n‘There seems to be a lot left today,’ said Faithful. ‘What’s happened to it all?’\n\n‘It’s all here still,’ said one of the women. ‘We were waiting for you to finish so that we could take it outside and share it out.’\n\n‘They’ll never be able to eat all that,’ said Faithful. ‘Put a couple of bowlfuls on a tray and take them to Patience in Mrs Lian’s room.’\n\n‘She’s already eaten,’ said Xi-feng. ‘There’s no need to send her any.’\n\n‘If she can’t eat it, she can give it to your cat,’ said Faithful.\n\nThe woman made a selection and carried it out on a tray.\n\n‘Where’s Suryana?’ Faithful asked Li Wan.\n\n‘They’re all eating together in here,’ said Li Wan. ‘What do you want her for?’\n\n‘Oh, nothing,’ said Faithful.\n\n‘Aroma isn’t here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why don’t you send a couple of dishes round to her?’\n\nFaithful gave instructions for this to be done, then turned once more to the women.\n\n‘Have you got the collation-box ready for the drinking later on?’\n\n‘I shouldn’t think it will be needed for a while yet,’ said one of the women.\n\n‘Well, get a move on with it,’ said Faithful.\n\n‘Yes, miss,’ said the woman.\n\nXi-feng and the others now went on to Tan-chun’s room. They found her there with her mother, laughing and talking together. Tan-chun’s love of spaciousness had caused her to have the three room-units of which her apartment was composed thrown into a single large one. In the middle of it stood a huge rosewood table with a marble top, on which were laid out various examples of the famous calligraphers’ art, several tens of inkstones, and a number of brush-pots stuffed with brushes like a forest of quills. In one corner of the room stood a porcelain jardinière of Ru ware as big as a bushel measure, containing a whole jardinière-ful of crystal-ball chrysanthemums. On the wall above it hung a large painting by Mi Xiangyang, ‘Rain on the Xiang River’, and on each side of the painting a couplet in the calligraphy of Yan Lu-gong:\n\nThe mist and clouds nurture my rustic frame;\nThe moon and the breeze price my plain livelihood.\n\nOn the table stood a great antique bronze ding. On a red sandalwood stand to the left of it was a large platter of Guan ware containing several dozen beautiful yellow ‘Buddha’s-hand’ citrons. On a foreign-lacquered stand to the right hung a suspended musical stone of white jade in the shape of a flatfish, with a little wooden striker suspended beside it. Ban-er, who by now was feeling more at home, made a grab for the striker, evidently intending to beat the stone with it, but one of the maids restrained him. Then he wanted to eat one of the citrons and Tan-chun gave him one to play with.\n\n‘You can’t eat that,’ she told him. ‘It’s for the scent.’\n\nIn the eastern part of the room was Tan-chun’s canopied bed. The canopy was of gauze embroidered with flowers and grasses and insects in two different shades of green. Ban-er ran over to look at it.\n\n‘Look! Crickets! And grasshoppers!’\n\nGrannie Liu dealt him a resounding slap.\n\n‘You filthy little bugger! Just because you’ve been allowed in to have a look, you think you can do anything you want. I’ll give you “crickets”!’\n\nThe slap made Ban-er cry and it was some time before the others could pacify him.\n\nGrandmother Jia, who had been looking out through the gauze of the window at the courtyard outside, turned to the others.\n\n‘The Wu-t’ung tree at the back there is very nice,’ she said. ‘Pity it’s such a poor, thin specimen.’\n\nAs she was speaking, a sudden gust of wind blew towards them, carrying with it the faint sound of drumming and piping.\n\n‘Someone’s having a wedding,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It must be quite near here, next door to the street.’\n\n‘You couldn’t possibly hear anything from the street in here,’ said Lady Wang and the others, laughing. ‘That’s our little band of girl musicians practising.’\n\n‘In that case, why don’t we have them in to play for us?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘They can combine business with pleasure. It will be an outing for them and we shall enjoy it, too. What do you say?’\n\nXi-feng at once gave orders that this should be done.\n\nShe had the servants go to summon them and gave orders for a long table to be set out and spread with a red felt carpet.\n\n“Set it up in the pavilion on the Lotus Fragrance Anchorage,” said the Lady Dowager. “The music will sound better carried over the water. Then we can feast in the Porcelain Tower, which is roomy and near enough to hear clearly.”\n\nWhen all had approved she said to Aunt Xue with a smile, “Let’s go. Those girls don’t like people intruding for fear we’ll mess up their rooms. We mustn’t be a nuisance but go boating and have some wine.”\n\nThey started out then and there.\n\n“What an idea!” cried Tanchun. “We’d love to have our Old Ancestress and aunts come and sit here, but we can’t get you to.”\n\n“My third girl’s all right,” rejoined the Lady Dowager playfully. “It’s only those two precious jades of ours that are so hateful. When we’re drunk we’ll go and raise a runpus in their rooms.”\n\nThis raised a laugh.\n\nThey had not far to go before reaching Xing Can Creek, where the boatwomen from Gusu had punted over two crab-apple wood punts. The old lady, Lady Wang, Aunt Xue, Granny Liu, Yuanyang and Yuchuan were helped into the first boat, and Li Wan followed them. Xifeng, who had also embarked, stood up in the prow and wanted to punt.\n\n“That’s no joke,” called the Lady Dowager from the cabin. “This may not be the river, but the water’s deep enough. You’d better come in at once.”\n\n“Don’t worry, Old Ancestress,” replied Xifeng with a laugh. “There’s nothing to be afraid of.” But as she poled off and the boat reached the middle of the lake, it rocked because it was so small and so crowded. She hastily handed her pole to a boatwoman and squatted down.\n\nThen Yingchun and the other young people and Baoyu boarded the second boat, which followed the first. The other matrons and maids lined the bank.\n\n“How tiresome these withered lotus leaves are!” exclaimed Baoyu. “Why don’t they get someone to pull them out?”\n\n“We haven’t had time these last few days,” Baochai told him. “Everybody’s been enjoying the garden every day, so we’ve had no time to get it cleaned up.”\n\n“I don’t care for Li Shangyin’s poetry,” said Daiyu, “except for that one line: ‘I leave the withered lotus to hear the patter of rain.’ But now you don’t even want these withered leaves.”\n\n“That certainly is a good line,” agreed Baoyu. “In that case we won’t have them removed.”\n\nBy now they had reached the port under the flower hedge by Seeping Fragrance Cove, and the air struck piercingly cold. The withered reeds and caltrops on both banks enhanced the autumn atmosphere. The Lady Dowager, seeing a spacious building with clear windows on the bank, asked, “Isn’t that Miss Xue’s place?”\n\nWhen they assented she ordered the boat to moor, and they went up the stone steps and through the clouds to Hengwu Court. As they entered, a strange fragrance assailed their nostrils. The rare plants and creepers here were green and luxuriant in the cold, and all were hung with clusters of fruit like coral beans, charming to behold. The rooms inside were as bare as a cave, with no ornaments or fine furnishings — only a vase on the table with some chrysanthemums, a few books and tea-things. The bed-curtains were of gauze and the bedding too was simple.\n\n“The child is too Spartan,” sighed the old lady. “If you’ve no ornaments, why not ask your aunt for some? I wasn’t paying attention and never thought of it. Of course, you’ve left your own things at home.”\n\nShe told Yuanyang to fetch some antiques, then scolded Xifeng, “Haven’t you any vases or other things you could give your cousin? How can you be so thoughtless?”\n\n“I did send her some,” Lady Wang and Xifeng assured her, laughing. “But she sent them back.”\n\nAunt Xue laughed too and said, “She never had many such things at home either.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager shook her head.\n\n“That won’t do. Even if she’s simple and doesn’t care for such things, it would look bad if some relative called; besides, it’s not propitious for a young girl’s room to be so sparse. If that’s the case, we old women should go and live in the stables.”\n\nLady Wang and the girls could not help laughing at this.\n\n“The young ladies’ boudoirs you read of in books or see in operas are exquisitely furnished,” she went on. “Although our girls can’t compare with those young ladies, we mustn’t let things get out of hand. Why not use the nice things we have? If you want to keep it simple, you can leave out a few. I used to be very good at arranging rooms, but now I’m old and don’t bother. The girls should learn to do it nicely, though. I was afraid they might be rather vulgar and spoil the effect of nice things; but they don’t seem to me vulgar. Now let me fix things for you. I guarantee it will be in good taste without being showy. I’ve a couple of things I’ve kept put away which Baoyu has never set eyes on. If he had, he’d have made off with them.”\n\nShe called for Yuanyang and ordered, “Fetch that miniature rockery in a pot, that gauze screen and the ink-stained agate tripod. Just put these three things on the desk. Then bring that white silk curtain with ink paintings and writing on it and change this one for it.”\n\n“Yes, madam,” replied Yuanyang. “But all those things are stored away in chests upstairs in the east attic, and it’ll take some time to find them. I’ll fetch them tomorrow.”\n\n“Very well, the day after will do. But don’t forget.”\n\nThe old lady sat there a little longer before leaving and going straight to Painted Splendour Tower. The players came up to pay their respects and asked what tunes they should perform.\n\n“Just play a few of your best pieces,” she said.\n\nThey withdrew then to Alpinia Park.\n\nBy now Xifeng and her helpers had set everything out nicely. On the left and right were two couches, each spread with a brocade mattress and having two carved lacquer tables in front of them. Some of these tables were shaped like crab-apple blossoms, others like plum-blossom, lotus-seed-pods or sunflowers; some were square, others round, all of different designs. On each was a burner, an incense-container and a box of refreshments. The two couches with four small tables were for the Lady Dowager and Aunt Xue. Below them was one armchair with two small tables for Lady Wang. All the others had one armchair and one small table apiece. On the east side Granny Liu had the first place, below her Lady Wang. On the west side the first was Xiangyun, then Baochai, Daiyu, Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun in that order, with Baoyu last. Li Wan and Xifeng had their places just inside the glass door of the inner room. The boxes of refreshments matched the tables in design. Each person had a silver-mounted, foreign-inlaid pewter winepot and an enamelled cloisonne cup with designs of the ten treasures.\n\nWhen all were seated the Lady Dowager proposed with a smile, “Let’s start with a few drinks. If we play a drinking game today it will be more fun.”\n\n“Of course you have good drinking games, madam,” said Aunt Xue. “But we’re no good at them and you just want to make us drunk. We’d better each drink a few cups.”\n\n“You’re being too modest today, aunt,” teased the old lady. “I suppose it’s because you think me too old.”\n\n“It’s not modesty, madam. I’m afraid if I can’t manage it I shall make a fool of myself.”\n\n“Even if you can’t, you’ll just have to drink a cup then go to sleep,” put in Lady Wang. “Who’s going to laugh at you?”\n\nAunt Xue nodded and said with a smile, “Very well. I’ll obey. But you must drink the first cup to start the game, madam.”\n\n“Naturally,” agreed the old lady and drank a cup.\n\nXifeng promptly stepped forward to propose, “We should ask Yuanyang to be the umpire.”\n\nSince everyone knew that the old lady’s games had to be directed by Yuanyang, they approved of this suggestion. Xifeng dragged Yuanyang over.\n\n“As an umpire you can’t remain standing,” said Lady Wang. She told a maid, “Fetch a stool and put it here by your mistresses’ table.”\n\nAfter making a show of declining, Yuanyang thanked them and sat down. She drank a cup of wine too, then smiled.\n\n\"A game of forfeits is as strict as a military order,\" declared Yuanyang. \"High or low, everyone must obey me. Whoever disobeys will be made to pay a forfeit.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" they cried. \"Go on, quickly!\"\n\nBefore Yuanyang could start, Granny Liu left the table with a gesture of protest.\n\n\"Don't make a fool of me!\" she begged. \"I'd better go home.\"\n\n\"No, you can't do that,\" cried the rest laughingly.\n\nYuanyang ordered the younger maids, \"Drag her back to the table.\"\n\nGiggling, the maids obediently pulled the old woman back to her seat.\n\n\"Let me off!\" she pleaded.\n\n\"One more word and you'll have to drink a whole kettle of wine,\" warned Yuanyang, at which Granny Liu desisted.\n\nYuanyang continued, \"Now I'm going to announce the domino combinations, starting from the old lady and going down to Granny Liu. I'll name a set of three dominoes, then break them down. First I'll describe the first, then the second, then the third, and finally the whole set. After each line you must quote from some poem, song or proverb a matching line which rhymes. Anyone who slips up must drink a cup of wine as a forfeit.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" cried the others. \"Let's start.\"\n\nYuanyang began, \"Here's the first set. On the left is a 'sky' domino.\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager responded, \"Overhead is a clear sky.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried the rest.\n\n\"In the middle a 'five and six',\" said Yuanyang.\n\n\"The sixth bridge is fragrant with plum-blossom,\" answered the Lady Dowager.\n\n\"That leaves a 'six and one',\" said Yuanyang.\n\n\"Up flies a red sun from the clouds,\" quoth the Lady Dowager.\n\n\"The whole set makes 'a scruffy ghost',\" announced Yuanyang.\n\n\"The ghost is clinging to Zhong Kui's leg.\" As she ended, the others laughed and applauded. The old lady drank her cup of wine.\n\nYuanyang continued, \"Now for another set. On the left is a 'long five'.\"\n\nAunt Xue replied, \"Plum-petals dance in the breeze.\"\n\n\"On the right is a 'big five',\" said Yuanyang.\n\n\"Plum-blossom on the ridge smells sweet in October.\"\n\n\"In the middle 'two and five make seven'.\"\n\n\"The Cowherd and the Weaving Maid meet on the seventh of July.\"\n\n\"The whole set is 'the second brother travelling to the five mountains'.\"\n\n\"Mortals can't compare with immortals in happiness.\" When she had done, the others praised her and she drank her forfeit.\n\nYuanyang went on, \"Here's another set. On the left two 'long ones' which are bright.\"\n\nXiangyun answered, \"The sun and moon together shine on the world.\"\n\n\"On the right two 'long ones' which are bright.\"\n\n\"Fallen silent blooms are trodden underfoot.\"\n\n\"In the middle a 'one and four'.\"\n\n\"Red apricock leans against the clouds beside the sun.\"\n\n\"The whole set is 'nine ripe cherries'.\"\n\n\"They're carried from the imperial garden by a bird.\" Having said this, she drank her cup.\n\nYuanyang said, \"Another set. On the left a 'long three'.\"\n\nBaochai replied, \"A pair of swallows twitter between the beams.\"\n\n\"On the right a 'long three'.\"\n\n\"Water-weeds are tugged by the wind, long as kingfisher ribbons.\"\n\n\"In the middle 'three and six' make nine points.\"\n\n\"Three mountains fall half through the azure sky.\"\n\n\"The whole set is 'a lonely boat tied with an iron chain'.\"\n\n\"Everywhere the wind and waves bring grief.\" Having said this, she drank.\n\nYuanyang continued, \"On the left a 'sky' domino.\"\n\nDaiyu answered, \"A fine day and lovely scene — but they displease me.\" Baochai turned to look at her curiously, but Daiyu, too afraid of a forfeit to care, ignored her.\n\n\"In the middle an attractive 'screen of brocade'.\"\n\n\"At the gauze window no messenger brings news.\"\n\n\"That leaves 'two, six and eight' all even.\"\n\n\"Two jade sceptres usher in the courtiers.\"\n\n\"The whole set is a basket for gathering flowers.\"\n\n\"A fairy staff picks herbaceous peony.\" Having said this, she took a sip of wine.\n\nYuanyang said, \"On the left 'four and five' make a nine of mixed flowers.\"\n\nYingchun answered, \"Peach-blossom is drenched with rain.\"\n\n“You must pay a forfeit!” they cried. “You’ve used the wrong rhyme and it doesn’t sound right.”\n\nYing-chun laughingly took a sip of wine.\n\nIn point of fact, Xifeng and Yuanyang had told everyone to give a wrong answer as they wanted to hear Granny Liu make some comical remarks. Yuanyang had answered for Lady Wang when her turn came. And now it was the old woman’s turn.\n\n“We villagers sometimes amuse ourselves this way when we’ve nothing to do,” said Granny Liu. “But not with such fine verses, of course. I’ll have to try my hand at it though.”\n\n“It’s quite easy,” they told her. “Just say whatever you like. It doesn’t matter.”\n\n“The big ‘four’ on the left is a man,” Yuanyang told her.\n\nAfter thinking for some time Granny Liu said, “A farmer, eh?”\n\nThe whole party roared with laughter.\n\n“That’s good. Just the thing,” cried the Lady Dowager.\n\n“We country folk are just country folk,” chuckled the old woman. “Don’t laugh at me, young ladies.”\n\n“In the middle ‘three-four’ are green and red,” said Yuanyang.\n\n“A big fire burns the hairy caterpillar,” answered Granny Liu.\n\nThey laughed, “Yes, that’s the style. She speaks her mind.”\n\n“On the right the ‘pretty four’ are so refined.”\n\n“A turnip and garlic-head,” replied the old woman.\n\nAnother burst of laughter.\n\n“Put together, they make ‘a branch of flowers,’” said Yuanyang.\n\nGranny Liu, gesturing with both hands, was almost too overcome to speak for laughing. “When the flower falls the fruit is formed — a big pumpkin.”\n\nAt that the whole company exploded with mirth.\n\nBut then a hubbub was heard outside. To know what it was, read the next chapter."
