  "original": "且说秦钟、宝玉二人跟着凤姐自铁槛寺照应一番，坐车进城，到家见过贾母、王夫人等，回到自己房中，一夜无话。至次日，宝玉见收拾了外书房，约定了和秦钟念夜书。偏偏那秦钟秉赋最弱，因在郊外受了些风霜，又与智能儿几次偷期缱绻，未免失于检点，回来时便咳嗽伤风，饮食懒进，大有不胜之态，只在家中调养，不能上学。宝玉便扫了兴，然亦无法，只得候他病痊再议。\n　　那凤姐却已得了云光的回信，俱已妥协，老尼达知张家，那守备无奈何，忍气吞声受了前聘之物。谁知爱势贪财的父母，却养了一个知义多情的女儿，闻得退了前夫，另许李门，他便一条汗巾悄悄的寻了自尽。那守备之子谁知也是个情种，闻知金哥自溢，遂投河而死。可怜张、李二家没趣，真是“人财两空”。这里凤姐却安享了三千两。王夫人连一点消息也不知。自此凤姐胆识愈壮，以后所作所为，诸如此类，不可胜数。\n　　一日正是贾政的生辰，宁荣二处人丁，都齐集庆贺，热闹非常。忽有门吏报道：“有六官都太监夏老爷特来降旨。”吓的贾赦、贾政一干人不知何事，忙止了戏文、撤去酒席，摆香案，启中门跪接。早见都太监夏秉忠乘马而至，又有许多跟从的内监。那夏太监也不曾负诏捧敕，直至正厅下马，满面笑容，走至厅上，南面而立，口内说：“奉特旨，立刻宣贾政入朝，在临敬殿陛见。”说毕，也不吃茶，便乘马去了。贾政等也猜不出是何来头，只得即忙更衣入朝。\n　　贾母等合家人心俱惶惶不定，不住的使人飞马来往探信。有两个时辰，忽见赖大等三四个管家喘吁吁跑进仪门，报喜，又说：“奉老爷的命，就请老太太率领太太等进宫谢恩呢。”那时贾母心神不定，在大堂廊下伫候，邢、王二夫人、尤氏、李执、凤姐、迎春妹妹以及薛姨妈等，皆聚在一处打听信息。贾母又唤进赖大来细问端底，赖大道：“奴才们只在外朝房伺候着，里头的信息一概不知。后来夏太监出来道喜，说咱们家的大姑奶奶封为凤藻宫尚书，加封贤德妃。后来老爷出来也这么吩咐。如今老爷又往东宫里去了。急速请太太们去谢恩。”贾母等听了方放下心来，一时皆喜见于面。于是都按品大妆起来。贾母率领邢、王二夫人并尤氏，一共四乘大轿，鱼贯入朝。贾赦、贾珍亦换了朝服，带领贾蔷、贾蓉，奉侍贾母前往。\n　　宁、荣两处上下内外人等，莫不欢天喜地，独有宝玉置若罔闻。你道什么缘故？原来近日水月庵的智能私逃入城来找秦钟，不意被秦邦业知觉，将智能逐出，将秦钟打了一顿，自己气的老病发了，三五日，便呜呼哀哉了。秦钟本自怯弱，又带病未痊受了笞杖，今见老父气死，悔痛无及，又添了许多病症。因此，宝玉心中怅怅不乐。虽有元春晋封之事，那解得他的愁闷？贾母等如何谢恩，如何回家，亲友如何来庆贺，宁荣两府近日如何热闹，众人如何得意，独他一个皆视有如无，毫不介意。因此众人嘲他越发呆了。\n　　且喜贾琏与黛玉回来，先遣人来报信：“明日就可到家了。”宝玉听了，方略有些喜意。细问原由，方知贾雨村也进京引见，皆由王子腾累上荐本，此来候补京缺。与贾琏是同宗弟兄，又与黛玉有师徒之谊，故同路作伴而来。林如海已葬入祖茔了，诸事停妥。贾涟这番进京，若按站走时本该出月到家，因听见元春喜信，遂昼夜兼程而进。路俱各平安。宝玉只问了黛玉好，馀者也就不在意了。\n　　好容易盼到明日午错，果报“琏二爷和林姑娘进府了。”见面时彼此悲喜交集，未免大哭一场，又致庆慰之词。宝玉细看那黛玉时，越发出落的超逸了。黛玉又带了许多书籍来，忙着打扫卧室，安排器具，又将些纸笔等物分送与宝钗、迎春、宝玉等。宝玉又将北静王所赠苓香串珍重取出来转送黛玉。黛玉说：“什么臭男人拿过的，我不要这东西。”遂掷还不取。宝玉只得收回，暂且无话。\n　　且说贾琏自回家见过众人，回至房中，正值凤姐事繁，无片刻闲空，见贾琏远路归来，少不得拨冗接待。因房内别无外人，便笑道：“国舅老爷大喜！国舅老爷一路风尘辛苦！小的听见昨日的头起报马来说，今日大驾归府，略预备了一杯水酒掸尘，不知可赐光谬领否？”贾琏笑道：“岂敢，岂敢！多承，多承！”一面平儿与众丫鬟参见毕，端上茶来。贾琏遂问别后家中诸事，又谢凤姐的辛苦。凤姐道：“我那里管的上这些事来！见识又浅，嘴又笨，心又直，人家给个棒槌，我就拿着认作针了。脸又软，搁不住人家给两句好话儿。况且又没经过事，胆子又小，太太略有点不舒服，就吓的也睡不着了。我苦辞过几回，太太不许，倒说我图受用，不肯学习，那里知道我是捻着把汗儿呢！一句也不敢多说，一步也不敢妄行。你是知道的，咱们家所有的这些管家奶奶，那一个是好缠的？错一点儿他们就笑话打趣，偏一点儿他们就指桑骂槐的抱怨，‘坐山看虎斗’，‘借刀杀人’，‘引风吹火’，‘站干岸儿’，‘推倒了油瓶儿不扶’，都是全挂子的本事。况且我又年轻，不压人，怨不得不把我搁在眼里。更可笑那府里蓉儿媳妇死了，珍大哥再三在太太跟前跪着讨情，只要请我帮他几天，我再四推辞，太太做情应了，只得从命。到底叫我闹了个马仰人翻，更不成个体统。至今珍大哥还抱怨后悔呢。你明儿见了他，好歹赔释赔释，就说我年轻，原没见过世面，谁叫大爷错委了他呢。”\n　　说着，只听外间有人说话，凤姐便问：“是谁？”平儿进来回道：“姨太太打发香菱妹子来问我一句话，我已经说了，打发他回去了。”贾琏笑道：“正是呢。我才见姨妈去，和一个年轻的小媳妇子刚走了个对脸儿，长得好齐整模样儿。我想咱们家没这个人哪，说话时问姨妈，才知道是打官司的那小丫头子，叫什么香菱，竟给薛大傻子作了屋里人。开了脸，越发出挑的标致了。那薛大傻子真玷辱了他！”凤姐把嘴一撇，道：“哎！往苏杭走了一趟回来，也该见点世面了，还是这么眼馋肚饱的。你要爱他，不值什么，我拿平儿换了他来好不好？那薛老大也是吃着碗里瞧着锅里的，这一年来的时候，他为香菱儿不能到手，和姑妈打了多少饥荒。姑妈看着香菱的模样儿好还是小事，因他做人行事，又比别的女孩子不同，温柔安静，差不多儿的主子姑娘还跟不上他，才摆酒请客的费事，明堂正道给他做了屋里人。过了没半月，也没事人一大堆了。”一语未了，二门上的小厮传报：“老爷在大书房里等着二爷呢。”贾琏听了，忙忙整衣出去。\n　　这里凤姐因问平儿：“方才姑妈有什么事，巴巴儿的打发香菱来？”平儿道：“那里来的香菱！是我借他暂撒个谎儿。奶奶瞧，旺儿嫂子越发连个算计儿也没了。”说着，又走至凤姐身边，悄悄说道：“那项利银早不送来，晚不送来，这会子二爷在家，他偏送这个来了。幸亏我在堂屋里碰见了，不然他走了来回奶奶，叫二爷要是知道了，咱们二爷那脾气，油锅里的还要捞出来花呢，知道奶奶有了体己，他还不大着胆子花么？所以我赶着接过来，叫我说了他两句，谁知奶奶偏听见了。为什么当着二爷我才只说是香菱来了呢！”凤姐听了笑道：“我说呢，姑妈知道你二爷来了，忽剌巴儿的打发个屋里人来。原来是你这蹄子闹鬼！”\n　　说着贾琏已进来了，凤姐命摆上酒馔来，夫妻对坐。凤姐虽善饮，却不敢任兴。正喝着，见贾琏的乳母赵嬷嬷走来。贾琏、凤姐忙让吃酒，叫他上炕去。赵嬷嬷执意不肯。平儿等早于炕沿设下一几，摆一脚踏，赵嬷嬷在脚踏上坐了，贾琏向桌上拣两盘肴馔与他，放在几上自吃。凤姐又道：“妈妈很嚼不动那个，没的倒硌了他的牙。”因问平儿道：“早起我说那一碗火腿炖的肘子很烂，正好给妈妈吃，你怎么不拿了去赶着叫他们热来？”又道：“妈妈，你尝一尝你儿子带来的惠泉酒。”赵嬷嬷道：“我喝呢。奶奶也喝一钟怕什么，只不要过多了就是了。我这会子跑了来倒也不为酒饭，倒有一件正经事，奶奶好歹记在心里，疼顾我些罢。我们这爷，只是嘴里说的好，到了跟前就忘了我们。幸亏我从小儿奶了你这么大。我也老了，有的是那两个儿子，你就另眼照看他们些，别人也不敢呲牙儿的。我还再三的求了你几遍，你答应的倒好，如今还是落空。这如今又从天上跑出这样一件大喜事来，那里用不着人？所以倒是来和奶奶说是正经。靠着我们爷，只怕我还饿死了呢！”凤姐笑道：“妈妈，你的两个奶哥哥都交给我。你从小儿奶的儿子还有什么不知他那脾气的？拿着皮肉倒往那不相干的外人身上贴。可是现放着奶哥哥那一个不比人强？你疼顾照看他们，谁敢说个不字儿？没的白便宜了外人。我这话也说错了，我们看着是外人，你却看着是内人一样呢！”说着，满屋里人都笑了。赵嬷嬷也笑个不住，又念佛道：“可是屋子里跑出青天来了。要说内人外人这些混账事，我们爷是没有的，不过是脸软心慈，搁不住人求两句罢了。”凤姐笑道：“可不是呢，有内人的他才慈软呢！他在咱们娘儿们跟前才是刚硬呢！”赵嬷嬷道：“奶奶说的太尽情了，我也乐了，再喝一钟好酒。从此我们奶奶做了主，我就没的愁了。”\n贾琏此时不好意思，只是讪笑道：“你们别胡说了，快盛饭来吃，还要到珍大爷那边去商量事呢。”凤姐道：“可是，别误了正事。才刚老爷叫你说什么？”贾琏道：“就为省亲的事。”凤姐忙问道：“省亲的事竟准了？”贾琏笑道：“虽不十分准，也有八九分了。”凤姐笑道：“可是当今的恩典呢！从来听书听戏，古时候儿也没有的。”赵嬷嬷又接道：“可是呢，我也老糊涂了！我听见上上下下吵嚷了这些日子，什么省亲不省亲，我也不理论；如今又说省亲，到底是怎么个缘故呢？”贾琏道：“如今当今体贴万人之心，世上至大莫如孝子，想来父母儿女之性，皆是一理，不在贵贱上分的。当今自为日夜侍奉太上皇、皇太后，尚不能略尽孝意，因见宫里嫔妃才人等皆是入宫多年，抛离父母，岂有不思想之理？且父母在家，思想女儿，不能一见，倘因此成疾，亦大伤天和之事。所以启奏太上皇、皇太后，每月逢二六日期，准椒房眷属入宫请候。于是太上皇、皇太后大喜，深赞当今至孝纯仁，体天格物，因此二位老圣人又下渝旨，说椒房眷属入宫，未免有关国体仪制，母女尚未能惬怀。竟大开方便之恩，特降谕椒房贵戚，除二六日入宫之恩外，凡有重宇别院之家，可以驻跸关防者，不妨启请内廷銮舆入其私第，庶可尽骨肉私情，共享天伦之乐事。此旨下了，谁不踊跃感戴！现今周贵妃的父亲已在家里动了工，修盖省亲的别院呢。又有吴贵妃的父亲吴天佑家，也往城外踏看地方去了。这岂非有八九分了？”\n    赵嬷嬷道：“阿弥陀佛！原来如此。这样说起，咱们家也要预备接大姑奶奶了？”贾琏道：“这何用说？不然这会子忙的是什么？”凤姐笑道：“果然如此，我可也见个大世面了。可恨我小几岁年纪，若早生二三十年，如今这些老人家也不薄我没见世面了。说起当年太祖皇帝仿舜巡的故事，比一部书还热闹，我偏偏的没赶上。”赵嬷嬷道：“嗳哟！那可是干载难逢的！那时候我才记事儿。咱们贾府正在姑苏扬州，带监造海船，修理海塘，只预备接驾一次，把银子花的象淌海水似的！说起来……”凤姐忙接道：“我们王府里也预备过一次。那时我爷爷专管各国进贡朝贺的事，凡有外国人来，都是我们家养活。粤、闽、滇、浙所有的洋船货物都是我们家的。”赵嬷嬷道：“那是谁不知道的？如今还有个俗语儿呢，说：‘东海少了白玉床，龙王来请金陵王。’这说的就是奶奶府上了。如今还有现在江南的甄家，嗳哟，好势派！独他们家接驾四次。要不是我们亲眼看见，告诉谁也不信的，别讲银子成了粪土，凭是世上有的，没有不是堆山积海的，‘罪过可惜’四个字竟顾不得了！”凤姐道：“我常听见我们太爷说，也是这样的，岂有不信的。只纳罕，他家怎么就这样富贵呢？”赵嬷嬷道：“告诉奶奶一句话：也不过拿着皇帝家的银子往皇帝身上使罢了，谁家有那些钱买这个虚热闹去！”\n　　正说着，王夫人又打发人来瞧凤姐吃完了饭不曾。凤姐便知有事等他，赶忙的吃了饭，漱口要走，又有二门上小厮们回：“东府里蓉、蔷二位哥儿来了。”贾琏才漱了口，平儿捧着盆盥手，见他二人来了，便问：“说什么话？”凤姐因亦止步，只听贾蓉先回说：“我父亲打发我来回叔叔，老爷们已经议定了，从东边一带，接着东府里的花园起至西北，丈量一共三里半大，可以盖造省亲别院了。已经传人画图样去了，明日就得。叔叔才回家，未免劳乏，不用过我们那边去，有话明日一早再请过去面议。”贾琏笑说：“多谢大爷费心，体谅我，就从命不过去了。正经是这个主意才省事，盖造也容易，若采置别的地方去，那更费事，且不成体统。你回去说，这样很好，若老爷们再要改时，全仗大爷深阻，万不可另寻地方。明日一早，我给大爷请安去，再细商量。”贾蓉忙应几个“是”。贾蔷又近前回说：“下姑苏请聘教习，采买女孩子，置办乐器行头等事，大爷派了侄儿，带领着赖管家两个儿子，还有单聘仁、卜固修两个清客相公，一同前去，所以叫我来见叔叔。”贾琏听了，将贾蔷打量了打量，笑道：“你能够在行么？这个事虽不甚大，里头却有藏掖的。”贾蔷笑道：“只好学着办罢咧。”\n　　贾蓉在灯影儿后头悄悄的拉凤姐儿的衣裳襟儿，凤姐会意，也悄悄的摆手儿佯作不知。因笑道：“你也太操心了！难道大爷比咱们还不会用人？偏你又怕他不在行了。谁都是在行的？孩子们这么大了，‘没吃过猪肉，也见过猪跑。’大爷派他去，原不过是个坐纛旗儿，难道认真的叫他讲价钱会经纪去呢。依我说，很好。”贾琏道：“这是自然。不是我驳回。少不得替他筹算筹算。”因问：“这一项银子动那一处的？”贾蔷道：“刚才也议到这里。赖爷爷说，竟不用从京里带银子去。江南甄家还收着我们五万银子。明日写一封书信会票我们带去，先支三万两，剩二万存着，等置办彩灯花烛并各色帘帐的使用。”贾琏点头道：“这个主意好。”凤姐忙向贾蔷道：“既这么着，我有两个妥当人，你就带了去办，这可便宜你。”贾蔷忙陪笑道：“正要和婶婶讨两个人呢，这可巧了。”因问名字。凤姐便问赵嬷嬷。彼时赵嬷嬷已听呆了，平儿笑着推他，才醒悟过来，忙说：“一个叫赵天梁，一个叫赵天栋。”凤姐道：“可别忘了。我干我的去了。”说着便出去了。贾蓉忙跟出来，悄悄的笑向凤姐道：“你老人家要什么，开个帐儿带去，按着置办了来。”凤姐笑着啐道：“别放你娘的屁！你拿东西换我的人情来了吗？我很不希罕你那鬼鬼祟祟的！”说着，一笑走了。\n　　这里贾蔷也问贾琏：“要什么东西，顺便置来孝敬。”贾琏笑道：“你别兴头。才学着办事，倒先学会了这把戏。短了什么，少不得写信来告诉你。”说毕，打发他二人去了。接着回事的人不止三四起，贾琏乏了，便传与二门上，一应不许传报，俱待明日料理。凤姐至三更时分方下来安歇。一宿无话。\n　　次日贾琏起来，见过贾赦、贾政，便往宁国府中来，合同老管事的家人等并几位世交门下清客相公们，审察两府地方，缮画省亲殿宇，一面参度办理人丁。自此后，各行匠役齐全，金银铜锡以及土木砖瓦之物，搬运移送不歇。先令匠役拆宁府会芳园的墙垣楼阁，直接入荣府东大院中。荣府东边所有下人一带群房已尽拆去。当日宁、荣二宅，虽有一条小巷界断不通，然亦系私地，并非官道，故可以联络。会芳园本是从北墙角下引了来的一股活水，今亦无烦再引。其山树木石虽不敷用，贾赦住的乃是荣府旧园，其中竹树山石以及亭栅栏杆等物，皆可挪就前来。如此两处又甚近便，凑成一处，省许多财力，大概算计起来，所添有限。全亏一个胡老名公号山子野，一一筹画起造。\n　　贾政不惯于俗务，只凭贾赦、贾珍、贾琏、赖大、赖升，林之孝、吴新登、詹光、程日兴等几人安插摆布。堆山凿池，起楼竖阁，种竹栽花。一应点景，又有山子野制度。下朝闲暇，不过各处看望看望，最要紧处和贾赦等商议商议便罢了。贾赦只在家高卧，有芥豆之事，贾珍等或自去回明，或写略节，或有话说便传呼贾琏、赖大等来领命。贾蓉单管打造金银器皿。贾蔷已起身往姑苏去了。贾珍、赖大等又点人丁，开册籍，监工等事。一笔不能写到，不过是喧阗热闹而已。暂且无话。\n　　且说宝玉近因家中有这等大事，贾政不来问他的书，心中自是畅快。无奈秦钟之病日重一日，也着实悬心，不能快乐。这日一早起来，才梳洗了，意欲回了贾母去望候秦钟，忽见茗烟在二门影壁前探头缩脑。宝玉忙出来问他：“做什么？”茗烟道：“秦大爷不中用了！”宝玉听了，吓了一跳，忙问道：“我昨儿才瞧了他，还明明白白的，怎么就不中用了呢？”茗烟道：“我也不知道，刚才是他家的老头子来特告诉我的。”宝玉听毕，忙转身回明贾母。贾母吩咐：“派妥当人跟去，到那里尽一尽同窗之情就回来，不许多耽搁了。”宝玉忙出来更衣。到外边，车犹未备，急的满厅乱转。一时催促的车到，忙上了车，李贵、茗烟等跟随。来至秦家门首，悄无一人，遂蜂拥至内室，吓的秦钟的两个远房婶娘、嫂子并几个姐妹，都藏之不迭。\n此时秦钟已发过两三次昏，易箦多时矣。宝玉一见，便不禁失声的哭起来。李贵忙劝道：“不可，秦哥儿是弱症，怕炕上硌的不受用，所以暂且挪下来松泛些。哥儿这一哭，倒添了他的病了。”宝玉听了，方忍住近前，见秦钟面如白蜡，合目呼吸，展转枕上。宝玉忙叫道：“鲸哥！宝玉来了。”连叫了两三声，秦钟不睬。宝玉又叫道：“宝玉来了。”那秦钟早已魂魄离身，只剩得一口悠悠馀气在胸，见许多鬼判持牌提索来捉他。那秦钟魂魄那里肯就去，又记念着家中无人管理家务，又惦记着智能儿尚无下落，因此百般求告鬼判。无奈这些鬼判都不肯徇私，反叱喝秦钟道：“亏你还是读书的人，岂不知俗语说的‘阎王叫你三更死，谁敢留人到五更。’我们阴间上下都是铁面无私的，不比阳间瞻情顾意，有许多的关碍处。”正闹着，那秦钟的魂魄忽听见“宝玉来了”四字，便忙又央求道：“列位神差略慈悲慈悲，让我回去和一个好朋友说一句话就来了。”众鬼道；“又是什么好朋友？”秦钟道：“不瞒列位，就是荣国公的孙子，小名儿叫宝玉的。”那判官听了，先就唬的慌张起来，忙喝骂那些小鬼道：“我说你们放了他回去走走罢，你们不依我的话。如今闹的请出个运旺时盛的人来了。怎么好？”众鬼见都判如此，也都忙了手脚，一面又抱怨道：“你老人家先是那么雷霆火炮，原来见不得‘宝玉’二字。依我们想来，他是阳间，我们是阴间，怕他亦无益。”那都判越发着急，吆喝起来。\n毕竟秦钟死活如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "To resume our story: After Chia Lien had seen to things in Iron Threshold Temple, he and Pao-yu took a carriage back to the city with Hsi-feng. They paid their respects to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang on their return, then went to their own quarters. And the rest of that day passed without incident.\n\nThe next day, when Pao-yu found his outer study prepared and knew that he and Ch’in Chung were to start studying there that evening, he was disappointed to learn that Ch’in Chung, who was of a delicate constitution, had caught a chill during their stay in the suburbs and come home to nurse a bad cough and cold. He had lost his appetite and looked very poorly. There was nothing for it but to wait until he recovered.\n\nHsi-feng, however, had received a reply from Yun Kuang saying that all was settled. The old abbess notified Chang’s parents, and the military governor had no choice but to suppress his indignation and take back the gifts he had sent. But the parents who were so ambitious and mercenary had a high-minded, loving daughter. Upon hearing that she had been withdrawn from her first fiancé to be betrothed to a Li, she secretly hanged herself with a handkerchief. And the governor’s son, who must have been a true lover too, drowned himself when he heard of Chin-ko’s suicide. So the Chang and Li families were left looking foolish, having lost both their children and their property. Hsi-feng, however, pocketed three thousand taels with a clear conscience, and Lady Wang did not hear the least whisper of the business. This emboldened Hsi-feng to behave even worse in future. Many more such cases occurred.\n\nThen came Chia Cheng’s birthday. While the whole clan of both mansions were assembled enjoying the operas and a feast, the gateman announced that the eunuch Hsia, Chief Chamberlain of the Sixth Palace, had come with an Imperial edict. In consternation, Chia Sheh and Chia Cheng and the rest stopped the plays, cleared away the feast and set out an incense table before opening the centre gate to kneel in迎接。\n\nThey saw the eunich Hsia ride up on horseback. Nor did he carry any Imperial mandate as he dismounted with a smile, walked into the hall and stood there facing south.\n\n“I am commanded to summon Chia Cheng to the Imperial presence in the Lin Ching Hall,” he announced.\n\nWith that he mounted again and rode away.\n\nChia Cheng and the others could not imagine what this portended, but he had to change into court clothes with all speed and go to the Palace.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the rest of the family were so worried that they sent one messenger after another to find out what was happening. Two hours later the stewards Lai Ta, Lai Sheng and some others came panting into the inner gate, too excited to contain themselves.\n\n“We have good news, madam,” they cried. “Our master’s orders are to ask the old lady to take the ladies to the Palace at once to offer thanks.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager, who had been waiting anxiously under the eaves of the large hall with Lady Hsing, Lady Wang, Madam Yu, Li Wan, Hsi-feng, the three Chia girls and Aunt Hsueh, called Lai Ta in to question him.\n\n“We servants were waiting in the outer court,” he said. “We were completely in the dark until the eunuch Hsia came out to offer his congratulations. He told us that our eldest young lady has been appointed Chief Secretary of the Phoenix Palace with the title of Virtuous and Noble Consort. Then our master came out and repeated this. He has gone now to the East Palace. He wants you to lose no time in going to offer thanks.”\n\nOnly then did the Lady Dowager set her mind at rest. She and the others were overjoyed, and their faces lit up. They lost no time in putting on the ceremonial dress appropriate to their rank, and the Lady Dowager headed the procession of four great litters as she took Lady Hsing, Lady Wang and Madam Yu to the Palace. Chia Sheh and Chia Chen also changed into court dress and escorted the Lady Dowager, taking Chia Chiang and Chia Jung with them.\n\nThen the two households of Ningkuo and Jungkuo were filled with delight. The only person completely unmoved was Pao-yu. What was the reason for that?\n\nThe fact was that recently Chin-chung’s friend Chih-neng from the Water Moon Convent had stolen into the city to look for him, but his father Ch’in Yeh had found out and driven her away, giving Chin-chung a beating which made him fall ill. This shock brought on a return of Ch’in Yeh’s old complaint, and in less than a week he was dead. Then Chin-chung, who had always been delicate and was now ill besides...\n\nHis father’s death from anger and mortification, coming on top of the effects of his flogging, had given him so many fresh ailments that Baoyu was sunk in depression. The news of Yuanchun’s promotion to an Imperial Consort had done nothing to distract him. He remained completely indifferent to the favour shown Their Ladyships by the Emperor, their return home, the congratulations of their relatives and friends, the excitement which had reigned of late in both mansions, and the general satisfaction. This struck everyone as increasingly foolish.\n\nThen to his relief Jia Lian and Daiyu came back, having sent a messenger ahead to announce: “They will be home tomorrow.” At last Baoyu looked rather more cheerful, and on inquiring he learned that Jia Yucun had also come to the capital for an audience at the Palace. He was a protege of Wang Ziteng, who had recommended him several times and he was now in the capital to await a vacancy. Since he was a clansman of Jia Lian’s and had been Daiyu’s tutor, he had travelled with them. Lin Ruhai was already buried in the ancestral graveyard and all the funeral arrangements had been properly carried out. Jia Lian, who would normally have taken over a month on the road, had made the journey day and night because of the good news about Yuanchun, and they had had a safe trip. The only thing Baoyu was concerned about was Daiyu’s health; he did not care about the rest.\n\nHe waited impatiently until noon the next day, when sure enough it was announced: “Master Lian and Miss Lin have entered the city.” They soon arrived and there was a tearful, joyful reunion between the cousins, followed by congratulations and condolences. Baoyu observed that Daiyu was even more ethereal than before. She had brought back a great many books and now she superintended the sweeping of her room and the arrangement of her things. She distributed brushes, paper and other gifts to Baochai, Yingchun and Baoyu. He in his turn fetched the string of scented beads given him by the Prince of Beijing and handed it to her.\n\n“What臭男人 man has worn this?” she cried. “I don’t want it.”\n\nShe threw it back. Baoyu had to put it away again, temporarily at a loss.\n\nTo return to Jia Lian. Having greeted the whole family he went to his own rooms where Xifeng, for all her many duties, had snatched a little time to welcome him home after his long journey. They were alone and she greeted him with a smile.\n\n“Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman! You must have had a tiring journey. I heard yesterday from the first courier that you’d be home today, so I prepared a little welcome feast. Will the Imperial Kinsman do me the honour of accepting my humble invitation?”\n\n“How dare I? How dare I?” He bowed and chuckled. “Many thanks, many thanks.”\n\nPinger and the other maids paid their respects to him and tea was served. Then Jia Lian asked after affairs at home and thanked Xifeng for her hard work.\n\n“How could I cope with so much?” she retorted. “I’m too ignorant, blunt and tactless, and容易上当别人给个棒槌，我就认作针。心肠又软，搁不住人给两句好话儿。 I’m too inexperienced to handle such important business. I’ve no courage either. At the least little thing I’m so scared I can’t sleep. I begged to be excused, but Her Ladyship wouldn’t hear of it. On the contrary, she accused me of being unwilling to learn and wanting to take things easy. She doesn’t realize that I’m in a constant sweat for fear of making some blunder. I daren’t say one word out of turn or take one false step. You know how difficult all the stewards’ wives are. The least slip and they laugh behind your back; if you show the least bias they gossip and complain. ‘Sitting on the hill to watch the tigers fight,’ ‘murdering with a borrowed knife,’ ‘borrowing wind to help the fire’— those are the tricks they’re up to. ‘Watching from an eminence while others drown,’ and ‘not troubling to right an oil bottle that’s been knocked over’— they’re well versed in all these arts. I’m too young, as well, to carry much weight; that’s why they ignore me. What’s more, after the death of Rong’s wife in the other house, Cousin Zhen asked the mistress again and again to let me help out there for a few days. I kept declining, but the mistress gave her consent to please him, so I had to go. I made a fearful mess of things there, I can tell you. I’m sure Cousin Zhen still\n\nWhat do I have to regret? If you see him tomorrow do your best to smooth things over. Tell him I’m young and inexperienced, and it was his mistake to put someone like me in charge.”\n\nJust then they heard someone talking outside and Xifeng asked who it was. Pinger came in to report: “Aunt Xue sent Caltrop to ask me something. I’ve given her an answer and sent her back.”\n\n“I was going to ask you about that,” chuckled Jia Lian. “When I called on Aunt Xue just now I ran into a young woman on her way out — a very handsome girl too. I couldn’t think who she was and asked my aunt, who told me she was the young Caltrop they had that trouble about. She’s now Xue Pan’s concubine. Since her hair was dressed she’s grown even more attractive. That big fool Xue is unworthy of her.”\n\nXifeng pursed her lips. “Well! After your trip to Suzhou and Hangzhou you should have seen enough of the world not to be so covetous. If you’ve taken a fancy to her, that’s simple enough. Shall I exchange Pinger for her?\n\n“That Cousin Xue of yours is another of those greedy-guts who keep one eye on the bowl and the other on the pan. When he first came here last year he raised a big rumpus with his mother because he couldn’t get Caltrop. And she didn’t give her to him just because the girl is good-looking. The main reason was that her behaviour’s better than other girls’. She’s so gentle and quiet, she’s a cut above most young ladies of good family. That’s why his mother gave a feast and in a proper, respectable way made her his concubine. But before half a month had passed, he was carrying on as if nothing had happened.”\n\nBefore she could say more a servant outside announced, “The master is waiting for you in his study, sir.”\n\nHearing this, Jia Lian hurried out to make himself presentable.\n\nThen Xifeng asked Pinger, “What did Aunt Xue want to send Caltrop here for just now?”\n\n“Caltrop? I only used her name as an excuse.” Pinger drew closer to her mistress and said softly, “That interest from the money-lender arrived. Of all times to choose, she had to bring it when the master was at home. Luckily I ran into her in the hall. If she’d come in to report to you and he’d found out about it — well, you know his temper. He’d snatch money out of a boiling cauldron. If he knew you had private savings, he’d be bolder than ever in spending. So I took the money and told her off for her indiscretion. I never thought you’d overheard me, madam. That’s why, in front of the master, I said Caltrop had come.”\n\n“I thought it strange,” laughed Xifeng. “If Aunt Xue had known the master was back, why should she suddenly send a concubine over? So it was your doing, you bitch.”\n\nAs she was speaking Jia Lian came in again, and Xifeng ordered serving-women to bring in wine and dishes. Husband and wife sat down to a meal. Although Xifeng could hold her own in drinking, she did not venture to indulge too much tonight. They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nanny Zhao, came in. The young couple made haste to urge her to join them and begged her to be seated on the kang, but she was far too respectful to do this. Pinger and the other maids put a small table next to the kang and set a footstool ready for her. Then, having seated herself on the footstool, she accepted the two dishes which Jia Lian selected for her from the table and set on the small table to eat by herself.\n\n“You’ll find that too tough to chew, nanny,” said Xifeng. “You’ll only break your teeth on it.” She turned to Pinger. “That knuckle of pork stewed with ham that we had this morning was very tender. Why didn’t you take some to be heated for nanny?” And she urged the old woman, “Have a taste of the Huichuan wine your son brought you, nanny.”\n\n“I will, but you have a cup too, madam. Not too much, though. I’ve come today....”\n\nThis isn’t for food or wine, but a serious business, ma’am. I do hope you’ll be good enough to remember me. For all his fine talk, the master forgets all about us when it comes to the point. It’s lucky I suckled you all those years when you were a baby. Now I’m old and have my two sons, if you’d only show them some special favour, no one else would dare to say a word. I begged you again and again to do something for them, and you promised very nicely; but it’s still not come to anything. Now this wonderful piece of luck has dropped down from Heaven. There are bound to be jobs going. So I’ve come to ask you, ma’am, to do something. If I had to depend on our master, I’d probably starve to death.”\n\n“Set your mind at rest, nurse,” said Xifeng with a smile. “I’ll take care of your two foster-sons. After suckling your young master all that time, you must know what he’s like — always ready to help any stranger he happens to meet, while his own foster-brothers are left out in the cold. But which of them isn’t better than outsiders? If you show them favour and look after them, who will dare to say ‘no’? It would be wrong to let strangers benefit instead. But perhaps I shouldn’t say that. Outsiders to us are insiders to you.” At this everyone in the room laughed, including Nanny Zhao, who chuckled:\n\n“Now at last I see light, ma’am. But our master isn’t really involved in any such silly business. He’s just too kind-hearted and can’t refuse anyone who begs a favour of him.”\n\n“That’s right,” agreed Xifeng. “It’s only to his ‘insiders’ that he’s kind. To us he’s hard enough.”\n\n“You’ve said quite enough, ma’am, to make me happy,” cried the nurse. “I’ll just drink one more cup of good wine, and from now on, with you in charge, I’ve nothing to worry about.”\n\nJia Lian, rather embarrassed by this time, forced a smile.\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense,” he said. “Bring in the rice quickly. I’ve got to go over to talk business with Lord Zhen.”\n\n“Yes, you mustn’t delay,” agreed Xifeng. “What did the old master want you for just now?”\n\n“It was about the provincial visits.”\n\n“Do you mean to say it’s been approved?” Xifeng asked eagerly.\n\n“Not quite, but very nearly.”\n\n“Well, that is the Emperor’s gracious favour.” Xifeng beamed. “I’ve never heard of such a thing in any book or play about the olden days.”\n\n“To be sure,” put in Nanny Zhao. “I’m getting senile. For days I’ve heard nothing but talk about these visits, but I didn’t pay much attention. Now that you mention it again, what’s it all about?”\n\n“Well, the present Emperor is most considerate and filial,” Jia Lian told her. “He thinks that all men, whether high or low, have the same feelings where their parents are concerned. And because he feels that even by waiting on the Grand Imperial Preceptor and the Empress Dowager day and night he cannot do enough to show his filial piety, it occurred to him that all the ladies in the Imperial Apartments must have been separated from their parents for many years and must be longing to see them. And their parents at home must be pining for a sight of their daughters. If this should make any of them fall ill, it would be a great distress to him. So he petitioned the Grand Imperial Preceptor and the Empress Dowager to allow the relatives of the Imperial Consorts to visit them in the Palace on the second and sixteenth of each month.\n\n“Their Majesties were delighted and praised the Emperor for his filial piety and great goodness. They went further, and issued a decree that, although these family visits to the Palace were in accordance with etiquette and state policy, they would not give the mothers and daughters a chance to enjoy themselves together. Therefore, in addition to the permission already granted, they graciously gave orders that the Imperial Consorts’ families should be allowed to prepare villas to which the ladies could pay visits, so that their families might enjoy the pleasure of gathering together without restraint.\n\n“After this decree, who could fail to express his joyful gratitude? The father of the Imperial Consort Zhou is already making preparations at home. So our\n\nWork has begun on building separate residences for the imperial consorts’ families. And Wu Tianyou, the father of Consort Wu, has gone outside the city to look for a site too. Doesn’t that look most likely?”\n\n“Gracious Buddha!” exclaimed Nanny Zhao. “So that’s the way it is. In that case, our family must be preparing to receive our eldest young lady?”\n\n“Of course,” said Jia Lian. “What else have we been so busy about all this time?”\n\n“If that’s really so, I shall see some great splendour too,” remarked Xifeng with a smile. “It’s a pity I’m a few years too young. If I’d been born twenty or thirty sooner, I wouldn’t be looked down on now by all these old people for never having seen anything of the world. They say the Old Emperor’s tour in imitation of Shun was the most wonderful spectacle. What a shame I just missed it!”\n\n“Ah, that was a rare chance in a thousand years,” cried Nanny Zhao. “I was just beginning to remember things then. The Jia family were in charge of building and repairing sea-going vessels and dykes in Suzhou and Yangzhou, and they prepared just once to receive the Emperor. My word, the money they spent was just like pouring out sea-water! To hear tell....”\n\n“My grandfather was in charge of the reception of tribute from different states and of entertaining envoys,” Xifeng cut in. “All foreigners coming to our court were looked after by our family. That’s why all the good things from the ships of Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan and Zhejiang are in our Wang family’s storehouses.”\n\n“Everyone knows that,” replied Nanny Zhao. “There’s a saying:\n\nIf the Dragon King wants a white jade bed,\n\nHe applies to the Wangs of Jinling.\n\nThat refers to your family, madam. And then there’s the Zhen family south of the Yangzi. What style they live in! They alone received the Emperor four times. If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe anyone who told me they’d prepared for his visits by spending money like dirt — nothing was too much for them. They didn’t stop to think whether it was a crime or a waste.”\n\n“I often heard my grandfather mention this,” said Xifeng. “How could I not believe it? But I’ve often wondered how the Zhens came to be so rich.”\n\n“Let me tell you something, madam,” said Nanny Zhao. “They were simply using the Emperor’s silver on the Emperor. What other family could afford to spend so much just for show?”\n\nAs they were talking a maid sent by Lady Wang came to ask whether Xifeng had finished her meal, as her mistress had something to discuss with her. Realizing that she was wanted, Xifeng hastily finished eating and rinsed her mouth. She was about to leave when a servant from the inner gate announced that Jia Rong and Jia Qiang of the East Mansion had called.\n\nJia Lian had just rinsed his mouth too and Pinger was holding a basin for him to wash his hands. When the two young men came in he asked what they wanted.\n\nXifeng also stopped to listen.\n\nJia Rong was the first to speak. “My father has sent me to tell you, uncle, that the gentlemen have decided: starting from the East Mansion’s garden and extending to the northwest, they’ve measured a plot three and a half li in all for building separate residences for the imperial consorts. They’ve already given orders for the plans to be drawn, and they’ll be ready tomorrow. As you’ve only just come back, uncle, you must be tired and there’s no need for you to go over. If there’s anything to discuss, you can go first thing tomorrow to talk it over.”\n\n“Many thanks to your father for his consideration,” said Jia Lian with a smile. “I’ll take his advice and not go over, then. That’s certainly the most sensible plan, as it will be easy to build there. Any other site would mean more trouble and wouldn’t be so suitable. Go back and tell him that I think it’s an excellent idea. If the other gentlemen want to make any changes, I hope he’ll dissuade them. They mustn’t choose any other place. I’ll come first thing tomorrow to pay my respects and discuss this further.”\n\nJia Rong assented promptly.\n\nThen Jia Qiang stepped forward to report, “My father says, uncle, that he’s sending me to Suzhou to engage instructors and buy girl actresses and the necessary costumes and properties. He wants me to go with Lai Da’s two sons and the two secretaries Shan Pingren and Bu Guxiu, so that we can talk things over together on the way.”\n\nSo he sent me to see you, uncle.”\n\nJia Lian looked the young man up and down.\n\n“Do you think you’re capable?” he asked with a smile. “This may not be a very big job, but there’s plenty of chance for fraud in it.”\n\n“I’ll have to learn as I go along.”\n\nJia Rong in the background stealthily plucked Xifeng’s jacket, and she, taking the hint, waved one hand surreptitiously as if to say she knew what to do but would not commit herself.\n\n“You worry too much,” she cried gaily. “Do you think Lord Zhen is less capable of choosing men than you are? You’re afraid this young fellow may not be up to the job. But who is born capable? As the proverb says, ‘A child may not have eaten pork, but he has seen a pig run.’ If Lord Zhen has put him in charge, he only means to have him there as a figurehead. It’s not as if he had to bargain with brokers and so on himself. I think it’s a very good choice.”\n\n“Of course, I’m not contradicting him,” said Jia Lian. “Still, I must think of a few things for him.”\n\nHe asked Jia Qiang, “Where will you get the silver from?”\n\n“We were just discussing that. Steward Lai proposes not taking any silver from the capital. The Zhens down south are holding fifty thousand taels of ours. We can take a letter of credit and go to withdraw thirty thousand first, leaving the other twenty thousand for lanterns, coloured candles, and all the curtains and streamers we shall need.”\n\nJia Lian nodded.\n\n“Good idea.”\n\n“In that case,” put in Xifeng, “I have two reliable men I’ll lend you. That will make things easier for you.”\n\n“I was just going to ask you, aunt, for the loan of a couple of men,” said Jia Qiang with a grateful smile. “How opportune!”\n\nWhen he asked their names, Xifeng asked Nanny Zhao. The old nurse, quite entranced by this discussion, had to be nudged by Pinger before she came to herself and said:\n\n“One is called Zhao Tianliang, the other Zhao Tiandong.”\n\n“Mind you don’t forget,” warned Xifeng. “I must attend to my own business now.”\n\nWith that she left, followed by Jia Rong, who whispered to her with a smile:\n\n“If there’s anything you want, make out a list and I’ll get it for you.”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense!” She spat in mock disgust. “Do you think I’m the sort to profit from your job? I’ve no use for such underhand ways.”\n\nShe went off then, smiling.\n\nJia Qiang also asked Jia Lian, “Is there anything you’d like, uncle, that I can get for you while I’m about it?”\n\n“Don’t be so carried away,” was the laughing reply. “Just learning to handle a job like this, and you start with such tricks. If I find I need anything, I’ll write to you.”\n\nWith that he sent them both off. Then, as more than three or four groups of servants came in on business, he felt tired and gave orders that no more should be admitted but all must wait until the next day. Xifeng did not retire until the third watch, but we need not dwell on that night.\n\nThe next day Jia Lian called on his father and uncle, then went to the Ning Mansion to consult with the chief stewards and secretaries of both mansions. They inspected the grounds and made plans for the construction of the different halls for the Imperial Consort’s visit, as well as making arrangements for the workmen. After this, craftsmen of every kind were assembled, and there was a constant coming and going of porters bringing gold, silver, copper, tin and earth, bricks, tiles and timber.\n\nFirst they demolished the walls and buildings of the Ning Mansion’s All-Scents Garden and incorporated it in the large court east of the Rong Mansion’s main hall. All the servants’ quarters in the east courtyard of the Rong Mansion had been pulled down. That day, although a narrow lane still separated the two mansions, this was private ground, not a public thoroughfare, so that they could be thrown into one. The stream in the All-Scents Garden, which had been led in from the north corner, needed no further attention. Although there were not enough rocks and trees, these could be brought from the old garden where Jia She lived, which had plenty of bamboos, trees, rocks, pavilions, kiosks and balustrades. And since the two places were so close, this would save much time and expense.\n\nHis contribution, however, was limited. The man chiefly responsible for the planning and construction was an old landscape artist known as Horticultural Hu.\n\nJia Zheng was not used to practical matters and left all the arrangements to Jia She, Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Lai Da, Lai Sheng, Lin Zhixiao, Wu Xindeng, Zhan Guang and Cheng Rixing. They piled up rocks and dug channels, erected halls and pavilions, planted bamboos and flowers. The landscaping, of course, was designed by Horticultural Hu. Jia Zheng merely dropped in to look round when he had time after court, and took most interest in discussing the more important aspects with Jia She and the others. Jia She simply stayed at home recuperating, and any trifling matters that arose were either reported to him by Jia Zhen and the rest or, if they had anything to propose, they would summon Jia Lian, Lai Da or others to receive their instructions. Jia Rong was in sole charge of the manufacture of gold and silver articles. And Jia Qiang had already left for Soochow. As for Jia Zhen, Lai Da and the rest, they were busy appointing stewards, keeping the accounts, and supervising the work. We need not go into all the bustle and excitement.\n\nBut let us return to Baoyu. As the construction of the Garden was such an important family event and his father was too busy to look into his studies, he was feeling thoroughly pleased with life. His only worry was Qin Zhong’s daily worsening illness. He was on tenterhooks and unable to feel real happiness.\n\nOne day he had just finished washing and dressing and was thinking of asking the Lady Dowager’s permission to visit Qin Zhong when he saw Mingyan peering round the screen wall opposite the inner gate. Baoyu hurried out to ask what he wanted.\n\n“Master Qin doesn’t look too good,” said the page.\n\nBaoyu was shocked. “But I saw him only yesterday, and he was clear-headed. however can he be in a bad way?”\n\n“I don’t know. That’s what his old father told me just now.”\n\nBaoyu hurried to inform his grandmother and she ordered, “Send someone reliable with him. He can go to pay his respects as a school friend, but he mustn’t stay too long.”\n\nBaoyu hastily changed his clothes and, finding his carriage not ready yet, ran frantically round the courtyard in his impatience. As soon as it was ready he drove off, accompanied by Li Gui and Mingyan, and dismounting at the gate of the Qin’s house, which was quiet and deserted, he hurried inside.\n\nHe found Qin Zhong’s two distant aunts and some female cousins had withdrawn in confusion at his approach. Qin Zhong himself, by now past speech, had lost consciousness several times and had long been laid on the kang in readiness for his end. The sight reduced Baoyu to tears.\n\n“That’s no way to carry on,” Li Gui admonished him. “Master Qin is weak. The kang is too hard for him, so he’s been moved down here to be more comfortable. If you carry on like that, you’ll make him worse.”\n\nBaoyu checked himself then and stepped closer. Qin Zhong, his face ashen, was breathing with his eyes closed as he tossed on his pillow.\n\n“Jingqing!” called Baoyu. “It’s Baoyu.”\n\nHe called twice, but there was no response.\n\n“Baoyu is here,” he cried again.\n\nQin Zhong’s spirit had already left his body. The stewards of the underworld held a warrant for his arrest and, as he had only one breath left in him, they were seizing this chance to fetter his soul and carry it off. But Qin Zhong’s spirit demurred, pleading that in the absence of anyone to manage the household and with no news of Zhi neng, he could not leave yet. He begged the stewards of the underworld to release him.\n\n“You’re an intelligent fellow,” they scoffed. “Have you never heard the saying, ‘If the King of Hell summons you at the third watch, who dares keep you till the fifth?’ In our nether world, high and low alike, we are impartial and never show favouritism, unlike the world of men where personal feelings may lead to abuses.”\n\nAs they were wrangling, Qin Zhong’s spirit heard Baoyu’s cry, “Baoyu is here.” At once he pleaded again, “Just be a little kind, gentlemen. Let me go back to say one word to a good friend. I won’t be long.”\n\n“What good friend?” demanded the stewards.\n\n“The grandson of the Duke of Rongguo. His name is Baoyu.”\n\nThis so alarmed him that he shouted at the imps, “I told you to let him go back for a while, but you wouldn’t do as I said. Now look what’s happened! He’s sent for someone in the height of power and fortune. What are we to do?”\n\nThe imps too were flustered by the judge’s dismay and complained, “Your Honour was so thunderously stern just now, yet the name Baoyu flusters you. But since he’s in the world of men and we’re in the nether regions, what does it matter if he is powerful? There’s no way he can come here.”\n\nThe judge snorted, “No wonder you lot are only fit to be imps. There’s an old saying: ‘The Prince of Hell may be strong, but it’s better not to offend a mortal official.’ They may be in the world of men, but their influence reaches down here to the shades. When a powerful official makes a complaint, we have to attend to it.”\n\nTo know whether Qin Zhong survived or not, read the next chapter."
