  "original": "话说黛玉正在情思萦逗、缠绵固结之时，忽有人从背后拍了一下，说道：“你作什么一个人在这里？”黛玉唬了一跳，回头看时，不是别人，却是香菱。黛玉道：“你这个傻丫头，冒冒失失的唬我一跳。这会子打那里来？”香菱嘻嘻的笑道：“我来找我们姑娘，总找不着。你们紫鹃也找你呢，说琏二奶奶送了什么茶叶来了。回家去坐着罢。”一面说，一面拉着黛玉的手，回潇湘馆来，果然凤姐送了两小瓶上用新茶叶来。黛玉和香菱坐了，谈讲些这一个绣的好，那一个扎的精，又下一回棋，看两句书，香菱便走了，不在话下。\n　　且说宝玉因被袭人找回房去，只见鸳鸯歪在床上看袭人的针线呢，见宝玉来了，便说道：“你往那里去了？老太太等着你呢，叫你过那边请大老爷的安去。还不快去换了衣裳走呢！”袭人便进房去取衣服。宝玉坐在床沿上褪了鞋，等靴子穿的工夫，回头见鸳鸯穿着水红绫子袄儿，青缎子坎肩儿，下面露着玉色绸袜，大红绣鞋，向那边低着头看针线，脖子上围着紫绸绢子。宝玉便把脸凑在脖项上，闻那香气，不住用手摩挲，其白腻不在袭人以下。便猴上身去，涎着脸笑道：“好姐姐，把你嘴上的胭脂赏我吃了罢！”一面说一面扭股糖似的粘在身上。鸳鸯便叫道：“袭人你出来瞧瞧！你跟他一辈子，也不劝劝他，还是这么着。”袭人抱了衣裳出来，向宝玉道：“左劝也不改，右劝也不改，你到底是怎么着？你再这么着，这个地方儿可也就难住了。”一边说，一边催他穿衣裳，同鸳鸯往前面来。\n　　见过贾母，出至外面，人马俱已齐备。刚欲上马，只见贾琏请安回来正下马。二人对面，彼此问了两句话，只见旁边转过一个人来，说：“请宝叔安。”宝玉看时，只见这人生的容长脸儿，长挑身材，年纪只有十八九岁，甚实斯文清秀。虽然面善，却想不起是那一房的，叫什么名字。贾琏笑道：“你怎么发呆，连他也不认得？他是廊下住的五嫂子的儿子芸儿。”宝玉笑道：“是了，我怎么就忘了。”因问他：“你母亲好？这会子什么勾当？”贾芸指贾琏道：“找二叔说句话。”宝玉笑道：“你倒比先越发出挑了，倒象我的儿子。”贾琏笑道：“好不害臊，人家比你大五六岁呢，就给你作儿子了？”宝玉笑道：“你今年十几岁？”贾芸道：“十八了。”原来这贾芸最伶俐乖巧的，听宝玉说象他的儿子，便笑道：“俗话说的好，‘摇车儿里的爷爷，拄拐棍儿的孙子’。虽然年纪大，‘山高遮不住太阳’。只从我父亲死了，这几年也没人照管，宝叔要不嫌侄儿蠢，认做儿子，就是侄儿的造化了。”贾琏笑道：“你听见了，认了儿子，不是好开交的。”说着笑着进去了。宝玉笑道：“明儿你闲了，只管来找我，别和他们鬼鬼祟祟的。这会子我不得闲儿，明日你到书房里来，我和你说一天话儿，我带你园里玩去。”说着，扳鞍上马，众小厮随往贾赦这边来。\n　　见了贾赦，不过是偶感些风寒。先述了贾母问的话，然后自己请了安，贾赦先站起来回了贾母问的话，便唤人来：“带进哥儿去太太屋里坐着。”宝玉退出来，至后面，到上房，邢夫人见了，先站起来请过贾母的安，宝玉方请安。邢夫人拉他上炕坐了，方问别人，又命人倒茶。茶未吃完，只见贾琮来问宝玉好。邢夫人道：“那里找活猴儿去！你那奶妈子死绝了，也不收拾收拾。弄的你黑眉乌嘴的，那里还象个大家子念书的孩子？”正说着，只见贾环、贾兰小叔侄两个也来请安。邢夫人叫他两人在椅子上坐着。贾环见宝玉同邢夫人坐在一个坐褥上，邢夫人又百般摸索抚弄他，早已心中不自在了，坐不多时，便向贾兰使个眼色儿要走。贾兰只得依他，一同起身告辞。\n　　宝玉见他们起身，也就要一同回去。邢夫人笑道：“你且坐着，我还和你说话。”宝玉只得坐了。邢夫人向他两个道：“你们回去，各人替我问各人的母亲好罢。你姑姑姐姐们都在这里呢，闹的我头晕，今儿不留你们吃饭了。”贾环等答应着便出去了。宝玉笑道：“可是姐姐们都过来了，怎么不见？”邢夫人道：“他们坐了会子，都往后头不知那屋里去了。”宝玉说：“大娘说‘有话说’，不知是什么话？”邢夫人笑道：“那里什么话，不过叫你等着同姐妹们吃了饭去，还有一个好玩的东西给你带回去玩儿。”娘儿两个说着，不觉又晚饭时候，请过众位姑娘们来，调开桌椅，罗列杯盘。母女秭妹们吃毕了饭，宝玉辞别贾赦，同众妹妹们回家，见过贾母王夫人等，各自回房安歇，不在话下。\n　　且说贾芸进去，见了贾琏，因打听：“可有什么事情？”贾琏告诉他说：“前儿倒有一件事情出来，偏偏你婶娘再三求了我，给了芹儿了。他许我说：‘明儿园里还有几处要栽花木的地方，等这个工程出来，一定给你就是了。’”那贾芸听了，半晌说道：“既这么着，我就等着罢。叔叔也不必先在婶娘跟前提我今儿来打听的话，到跟前再说也不迟。”贾琏道：“提他做什么，我那里有这工夫说闲话呢。明日还要到兴邑去走一走，必须当日赶回来方好。你先等着去。后日起更以后，你来讨信，早了我不得闲。”说着，便向后面换衣服去了。\n　　贾芸出了荣国府回家，一路思量，想出一个主意来，便一径往他舅舅卜世仁家来。原来卜世仁现开香料铺，方才从铺子里回来，一见贾芸，便问：“你做什么来了？”贾芸道：“有件事求舅舅帮衬，要用冰片、麝香，好歹舅舅每样赊四两给我，八月节按数送了银子来。”卜世仁冷笑道：“再休提赊欠一事！前日也是我们铺子里一个伙计，替他的亲戚赊了几两银子的货，至今总没还，因此我们大家赔上，立了合同，再不许替亲友赊欠，谁要犯了，就罚他二十两银子的东道。况且如今这个货也短，你就拿现银子到我们这小铺子来买，也还没有这些，只好倒扁儿去，这是一件。二则你那里有正经事？不过赊了去又是胡闹。你只说舅舅见你一遭儿就派你一遭儿不是，你小人儿家很不知好歹，也要立个主意，赚几个钱，弄弄穿的吃的，我看着也喜欢。”贾芸笑道：“舅舅说的有理。但我父亲没的时候儿，我又小，不知事体。后来听见母亲说，都还亏了舅舅替我们出主意料理的丧事。难道舅舅是不知道的，还是有一亩地、两间房子在我手里花了不成？‘巧媳妇做不出没米的饭来’，叫我怎么样呢。还亏是我呢，要是别的死皮赖脸的，三日两头儿来缠舅舅，要三升米二升豆子，舅舅也就没法儿呢！”卜世仁道：“我的儿，舅舅要有，还不是该当的。我天天和你舅母说，只愁你没个算计儿。你但凡立的起来，到你们大屋里，就是他们爷儿们见不着，下个气儿和他们的管事的爷们嬉和嬉和，也弄个事儿管管。前儿我出城去，碰见你们三屋里的老四，坐着好体面车，又带着四五辆车，有四五十小和尚道士儿，往家庙里去了。他那不亏能干，就有这个事到他身上了？”贾芸听了唠叨的不堪，便起身告辞。卜世仁道：“怎么这么忙，你吃了饭去罢。”一句话尚未说完，只见他娘子说道：“你又糊涂了！说着没有米，这里买了半斤面来下给你吃，这会了还装胖呢。留下外甥挨饿不成？”卜世仁道：“再买半斤来添上就是了。”他娘子便叫女儿：“银姐，往对门王奶奶家去问：有钱借几十个，明儿就送了来的。”夫妻两个说话，那贾芸早说了几个“不用费事”，去的无影无踪了。不言卜家夫妻，且说贾芸赌气离了舅舅家门，一径回来，心下正自烦恼，一边想，一边走。低着头，不想一头就碰在一个醉汉身上，把贾芸一把拉住，骂道：“你瞎了眼？碰起我来了！”贾芸听声音象是熟人，仔细一看，原来是紧邻倪二。这倪二是个泼皮，专放重利债，在赌博场吃饭，专爱喝酒打架。此时正从欠钱人家索债归来，巳在醉乡，不料贾芸碰了他，就要动的。贾芸叫道：“老二，住手！是我冲撞了你。”倪二一听他的语音，将醉眼睁开，一看见是贾芸，忙松了手，趔趄着笑道：“原来是贾二爷。这会子那里去？”贾芸叫道：“告诉不得你，平白的又讨了个没趣儿。”倪二道：“不妨。有什么不平的事告诉我，我替你出气。这三街六巷凭他是谁，若得罪了我醉金刚倪二的街坊，管叫他人离家散！”贾芸道：“老二，你别生气，听我告诉你这缘故。”便把卜世仁一段事告诉了倪二。倪二听了大怒道：“要不是二爷的亲戚，我就骂出来。真真把人气死。也罢，你也不必愁，我这里现有几两银子，你要用只管拿去。我们好街坊，这银子是不要利钱的。”一头说，一头从搭包内掏出一包银子来。\n　　贾芸心下自思：“倪二素日虽然是泼皮，却也因人而施，颇有义侠之名。若今日不领他这情，怕他臊了，反为不美。不如用了他的，改日加倍还他就是了。”因笑道：“老二，你果然是个好汉。既蒙高情，怎敢不领，回家就照例写了文约送过来。”倪二大笑道：“这不过是十五两三钱银子，你若要写文约，我就不借了。”贾芸听了，一面接银子，一面笑道：“我遵命就是了。何必着急！”倪二笑道：“这才是呢。天气黑了，也不让你喝酒了，我还有点事儿，你竟请回罢。我还求你带个信儿给我们家，叫他们关了门睡罢，我不回家去了。倘或有事，叫我们女孩儿明儿一早到马贩子王短腿家找我。”一面说，一面趔趄着脚儿去了。不在话下。\n　　且说贾芸偶然碰见了这件事，心下也十分稀罕，想那倪二倒果然有些意思，只是怕他一时醉中慷慨，到明日加倍来要，便怎么好呢。忽又想道：“不妨，等那件事成了，可也加倍还的起他。”因走到一个钱铺里，将那银子称了称，分两不错，心上越发喜欢。到家先将倪二的话捎给他娘子儿，方回家来。他母亲正在炕上拈线，见他进来，便问：“那里去了一天？”贾芸恐母亲生气，便不提卜世仁的事，只说：“在西府里等琏二叔来着。”问他母亲：“吃了饭了没有？”他母亲说：“吃了。还留着饭在那里。”叫小丫头拿来给他吃\n　　那天已是掌灯时候，贾芸吃了饭，收拾安歇，一宿无话。次日起来，洗了脸，便出南门大街，在香铺买了冰麝，往荣府来。打听贾琏出了门，贾芸便往后面来。到贾琏院门前，只见几个小厮，拿着大高的苕帚在那里扫院子呢。忽见周瑞家的从门里出来叫小厮们：“先别扫，奶奶出来了。”贾芸忙上去笑问道：“二婶娘那里去？”周瑞家的道：“老太太叫，想必是裁什么尺头。”正说着，只见一群人簇拥着凤姐出来了。贾芸深知凤姐是喜奉承爱排场的，忙把手逼着，恭恭敬敬抢上来请安。凤姐连正眼也不看，仍往前走，只问他母亲好：“怎么不来这里逛逛？”贾芸道：“只是身上不好，倒时常惦记着婶娘，要瞧瞧，总不能来。”凤姐笑道：“可是你会撒谎！不是我提，他也就不想我了。”贾芸笑道：“侄儿不怕雷劈，就敢在长辈儿跟前撒谎了？昨儿晚上还提起婶娘来，说：‘婶娘身子单弱，事情又多，亏了婶娘好精神，竟料理的周周全全的。要是差一点儿的，早累的不知怎么样了。’”凤姐听了，满脸是笑，由不的止了步，问道：“怎么好好儿的，你们娘儿两个在背地里嚼说起我来？”贾芸笑着道：“只因我有个好朋友，家里有几个钱，现开香铺，因他捐了个通判，前儿选着了云南不知那一府，连家眷一齐去。他这香铺也不开了，就把货物攒了一攒，该给人的给人，该贱发的贱发。象这贵重的，都送给亲友，所以我得了些冰片、麝香。我就和我母亲商量，贱卖了可惜，要送人也没有人家儿配使这些香料。因想到婶娘往年间还拿大包的银子买这些东西呢，别说今年贵妃宫中，就是这个端阳节所用，也一定比往常要加十几倍，所以拿来孝敬婶娘。”一面将一个锦匣递过去。凤姐正是办节礼用香料，便笑了一笑，命丰儿：“接过芸哥儿的来，送了家去，交给平儿。”因又说道：“看你这么知好歹，怪不得你叔叔常提起你来，说你好，说话明白，心里有见识。”贾芸听这话入港，便打进一步来，故意问道：“原来叔叔也常提我？”凤姐见问，便要告诉给他事情管的话，一想又恐他看轻了，只说得了这点儿香料，便许他管事了。因且把派他种花木的事一字不提，随口说了几句淡话，便往贾母屋里去了。\n　　贾芸自然也难提，只得回来。因昨日见了宝玉，到外书房等着，故此吃了饭，又进来，到贾母那边仪门外绮散斋书房里来。只见茗烟在那里掏小雀儿呢。贾芸在他身后，把脚一跺，道：“茗烟小猴儿又淘气了！”茗烟回头，见是贾芸，便笑道：“何苦二爷唬我们这么一跳。”因又笑说：“我不叫茗烟了，我们宝二爷嫌‘烟’字不好，改了叫‘焙茗’了。二爷明儿只叫我焙茗罢。”贾芸点头笑着同进书房，便坐下问：“宝二爷下来了没有？”焙茗道：“今日总没下来。二爷说什么，我替你探探去。”说着，便出去了。\n　　这里贾芸便看字画古玩。有一顿饭的工夫，还不见来。再看看要找别的小子，都玩去了。正在烦闷，只听门前娇音嫩语的叫了一声“哥哥呀”。贾芸往外瞧时，是个十五六岁的丫头，生的倒甚齐整，两只眼儿水水灵灵的，见了贾芸，抽身要躲，恰值焙茗走来，见那丫头在门前，便说道：“好，好，正抓不着个信儿呢！”贾芸见了焙茗，也就赶出来，问：“怎么样？”焙茗道：“等了半日，也没个人过。这就是宝二爷屋里的。”因说道：“好姑娘，你带个信儿，就说廊上二爷来了。”那丫头听见，方知是本家的爷们，便不似从前那等回避，下死眼把贾芸钉了两眼。听那贾芸说道：“什么‘廊上’‘廊下’的，你只说芸儿就是了。”半晌，那丫头似笑不笑的说道：“依我说，二爷且请回去，明日再来。今儿晚上得空儿，我替回罢。”焙茗道：“这是怎么说？”那丫头道：“他今儿也没睡中觉，自然吃的晚饭早，晚上又不下来，难道只是叫二爷这里等着挨饿不成？不如家去，明儿来是正经。就便回来有人带信儿，也不过嘴里答应着罢咧。”贾芸听这丫头的话简便俏丽，待要问他的名字，因是宝玉屋里的，又不便问，只得说道：“这话倒是，我明日再来。”说着，便往外去了。焙茗道：“我倒茶去，二爷喝了茶再去。”贾芸一面走，一面回头说：“不用，我还有事呢。”口里说话，眼睛瞧那丫头还站在那里呢。\n　　那贾芸一径回来。至次日，来至大门前，可巧遇见凤姐往那边去请安，才上了车，见贾芸过来，便命人叫住，隔着窗子笑道：“芸儿，你竟有胆子在我跟前弄鬼！怪道你送东西给我，原来你有事求我。昨儿你叔叔才告诉我，说你求他。”贾芸笑道：“求叔叔的事，婶娘别提，我这里正后悔呢。早知这样，我一起头儿就求婶娘，这会子早完了，谁承望叔叔竟不能的。”凤姐笑道：“哦！你那边没成儿，昨儿又来找我了？”贾芸道：“婶娘辜负了我的孝心。我并没有这个意思，要有这个意思，昨儿还不求婶娘吗？如今婶娘既知道了，我倒要把叔叔搁开，少不得求婶娘，好歹疼我一点儿。”凤姐冷笑道：“你们要拣远道儿走么！早告诉我一声儿，多大点子事，还值得耽误到这会子。那园子里还要种树种花儿，我正想个人呢，早说不早完了？”贾芸笑道：“这样明日婶娘就派我罢？”凤姐半晌道：“这个我看着不大好，等明年正月里的烟火灯烛那个大宗儿下来，再派你不好？”贾芸道：“好婶娘，先把这个派了我，果然这件办的好，再派我那件罢。”凤姐笑道：“你倒会拉长线儿！罢了，要不是你叔叔说，我不管你的事。我不过吃了饭就过来，你到午错时候来领银子，后日就进去种花儿。”说着，命人驾起香车，径去了。\n　　贾芸喜不自禁，来至绮散斋打听宝玉，谁知宝玉一早便往北静王府里去了。贾芸便呆呆的坐到晌午。打听凤姐回来，去写个领票来领对牌，至院外，命人通报了，彩明走出来要了领票，进去批了银数、年月，一并连对牌交给贾芸。贾芸接来看那批上批着二百两银子，心中喜悦，翻身走到银库上领了银子，回家告诉他母亲，自是母子俱喜。次日五更，贾芸先找了倪二还了银子，又拿了五十两银子出西门找到花儿匠方椿家里去买树，不在话下。\n　　且说宝玉自这日见了贾芸，曾说过明日着他进来说话，这原是富贵公子的口角，那里还记在心上，因而便忘怀了。这日晚上，却从北静王府里回来，见过贾母、王夫人等回至园内。换了衣服，正要洗澡，袭人被宝钗烦了去打结子去了，秋纹、碧痕两个去催水。檀云又因他母亲病了接出去了，麝月现在家中病着，还有几个做粗活听使唤的丫头，料是叫不着他，都出去寻伙觅伴的去了。不想这一刻的工夫，只剩了宝玉在屋内。偏偏的宝玉要喝茶，一连叫了两三声，方见两三个老婆子走进来。宝玉见了，连忙摇手说：“罢罢，不用了。”老婆子们只得退出。宝玉见没丫头们，只得自己下来，拿了碗，向茶壶去倒茶。只听背后有人说道：“二爷看烫了手，等我倒罢。”一面说，一面走上来接了碗去。宝玉倒唬了一跳，问：“你在那里来着？忽然来了，唬了我一跳！”那丫头一面递茶，一面笑着回道：“我在后院里。才从里间后门进来，难道二爷就没听见脚步响么？”宝玉一面吃茶，一面仔细打量那丫头，穿着几件半新不旧的衣裳，倒是一头黑鸦鸦的好头发，挽着儿，容长脸面，细挑身材，却十分俏丽甜净。宝玉便笑问道：“你也是我屋里的人么？”那丫头笑应道：“是。”宝玉道：“既是这屋里的，我怎么不认得？”那丫头听说，便冷笑一声道：“爷不认得的也多呢，岂止我一个。从来我又不递茶水拿东西，眼面前儿的一件也做不着，那里认得呢？”宝玉道：“你为什么不做眼面前儿的呢？”那丫头道：“这话我也难说。只是有句话回二爷。昨日有个什么芸儿来找二爷，我想二爷不得空儿，便叫焙茗回他。今日来了，不想二爷又往北府里去了。”刚说到这句话，只见秋纹、碧痕嘻嘻哈哈的笑着进来，两个人共提着一桶水，一手撩衣裳，趔趔趄趄泼泼撒撒的。那丫头便忙迎出去接。\n　　秋纹、碧痕，一个抱怨“你湿了我的衣裳”，一个又说“你踹了我的鞋”。忽见走出一个人来接水，二人看时，不是别人，原来是小红。二人便都诧异，将水放下，忙进来看时，并没别人，只有宝玉，便心中俱不自在，只得且预备下洗澡之物。待宝玉脱了衣裳，二人便带上门出来，走到那边房内，找着小红，问他：“方才在屋里做什么？”小红道：“我何曾在屋里呢？因为我的绢子找不着，往后头找去，不想二爷要茶喝。叫姐姐们，一个儿也没有，我赶着进去倒了碗茶，姐姐们就来了。”秋纹兜脸啐了一口道：“没脸面的下流东西！正经叫你催水去，你说有事，倒叫我们去，你可抢这个巧宗儿！一里一里的，这不上来了吗？难道我们倒跟不上你么？你也拿镜子照照，配递茶递水不配！”碧痕道：“明儿我说给他们，凡要茶要水拿东西的事，咱们都别动，只叫他去就完了。”秋纹道：“这么说还不如我们散了，单让他在这屋里呢。”二人你一句我一句正闹着，只见有个老嬷嬷进来传凤姐的话说：“明日有人带花儿匠来种树，叫你们严紧些，衣裳裙子别混晒混晾的。那土山上都拦着围幕，可别混跑。”秋纹便问：“明日不知是谁带进匠人来监工？”那老婆子道：“什么后廊上的芸哥儿。”秋纹、碧痕俱不知道，只管混问别的活，那小红心内明白，知是昨日的外书房所见的那人了。“原来这小红本姓林，小名红玉，因“玉”字犯了宝玉、黛玉的名，便改唤他做“小红”。原来是府中世仆，他父亲现在收管各处田房事务。这小红年方十四，进府当差，把他派在怡红院中，倒也清幽雅静。不想后来命姊妹及宝玉等进大观园居住，偏生这一所儿，又被宝玉点了。这小红虽然是个不谙事体的丫头，因他原有几分容貌，心内便想向上攀高，每每要在宝玉面前现弄现弄。只是宝玉身边一干人都是伶牙俐爪的，那里插的下手去。不想今日才有些消息，又遭秋纹等一场恶话，心内早灰了一半。正没好气，忽然听见老嬷嬷说起贾芸来，不觉心中一动，便闷闷的回房。睡在床上，暗暗思量，翻来复去，自觉没情没趣的。忽听的窗外低低的叫道：“红儿，你的绢子我拾在这里呢。”小红听了，忙走出来看时，不是别人，正是贾芸。小红不觉粉面含羞，问道：“二爷在那里拾着的？”只见那贾芸笑道：“你过来，我告诉你。”一面说一面就上来拉他的衣裳。那小红臊的转身一跑，却被门槛子绊倒。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Daiyu was wrapped in tender thoughts when someone clapped her on the back and asked:\n\n“What are you doing here all on your own?”\n\nShe gave a start and turned to see who it was. It was Xiangling.\n\n“You stupid thing!” she cried. “How you scared me! Where have you sprung from?”\n\n“I’ve been looking everywhere for our young lady but couldn’t find her,” said Xiangling with a playful smile. “And Zijuan’s looking for you too. She told me that Madam Lian has sent you some tea. You’d better go home.”\n\nTaking Daiyu’s hand she walked with her to Bamboo Lodge, where sure enough they found two small bottles of the best new tea from Xifeng. The two girls sat down to discuss embroidery and fine needlework, then played draughts and read a book or two before Xiangling left. But no more of this.\n\nLet us return to Baoyu. He was fetched back to his room by Xiren, who found Yuanyang lying on the bed looking at her needlework. At sight of Baoyu she cried:\n\n“Where have you been? The old lady’s waiting for you. She wants you to go and pay your respects to your uncle. Hurry up and change your clothes.”\n\nXiren went into the inner room to fetch his clothes. Baoyu, sitting on the edge of the bed to take off his shoes, waited for his boots to be brought. Turning his head he saw Yuanyang in a pink silk jacket, black satin sleeveless jacket, and jade-coloured silk skirt with a red embroidered skirt beneath it. As she bent her head over the needlework, a violet silk neckerchief round her neck, he nestled up to her cheek to smell her fragrance and stroked her neck, finding it as smooth and white as Xiren’s. He started frisking and nuzzling against her with a foolish smile.\n\n“Do let me taste the rouge on your lips, dear sister!” he begged, clinging to her like sticky toffee.\n\n“Xiren!” Yuanyang called. “Come out and see this. You’re with him all the time, yet you’ve done nothing to cure him of such tricks.”\n\nXiren emerged with his clothes.\n\n“We’ve tried time and again to stop him, but it’s no use,” she told Baoyu. “What are we to do with you? If you go on like this, this is no place for us.”\n\nWhile urging him to dress she went with Yuanyang to the Lady Dowager’s apartments.\n\nAfter paying his respects to his grandmother, Baoyu went out to the front where his horse was ready. He was about to mount when Jia Lian, returning from paying a duty call, dismounted. The two exchanged a few words. Then a young man stepped forward.\n\n“Good day, Uncle Bao,” he said.\n\nBaoyu saw a handsome, slender, intelligent-looking lad of eighteen or nineteen.\n\n“Why are you staring so stupidly?” asked Jia Lian with a smile. “Don’t you recognize him? He’s Yun, the son of Fifth Sister-in-law who lives by the back gate.”\n\n“Of course,” exclaimed Baoyu. “How is it I forgot?” He asked Jia Yun, “How is your mother? What business brings you here?”\n\nJia Yun pointed at Jia Lian.\n\n“I’ve come to have a word with Second Uncle.”\n\n“You’ve grown very handsome,” said Baoyu. “You might really be my son.”\n\nJia Lian laughed.\n\n“For shame! He’s four or five years older than you, yet you talk of him as your son.”\n\n“How old are you?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“Eighteen.”\n\nClever Jia Yun had been quick to respond to Baoyu’s remark about his being like a son.\n\n“As the proverb says,” he quipped, “‘A grandfather in the cradle may have a grandson who’s a greybeard.’ Though I’m older than you, ‘the highest mountain can’t shut out the sun.’ Since my father died all these years I’ve had no one to look after me. If you don’t think me too stupid, uncle, why not take me for your son? Then I shall be made.”\n\n“Did you hear that?” Jia Lian chuckled.\n\nHaving a son acknowledged may not be so simple.” With that she went off smiling.\n\n“When you’ve time tomorrow, do drop over for a chat,” Baoyu told Jia Yun. “Don’t go plotting with them in corners. I’m busy now, but come to my study tomorrow and we can talk all day. I’ll take you for a stroll in the garden too.”\n\nHe mounted his horse then and rode off, escorted by pages, to Jia She’s house.\n\nHe found his uncle slightly indisposed with a chill. He first delivered the Lady Dowager’s message, then paid his respects. Jia She rose to his feet to ask after his mother, and ordered a servant to take the boy to have a seat in his wife’s room.\n\nBaoyu withdrew then to the back court and the main apartment. When Lady Xing saw him she rose to ask after the old lady, then Baoyu paid his respects to her. She made him sit on the kang beside her before inquiring after the others and ordering tea. Before he had finished his tea in came Jia Zong to pay his respects.\n\n“Where have you been, you young scamp?” scolded Lady Xing. “Is your nurse dead, that she doesn’t clean you up? Your face and eyebrows are covered with ink — you don’t look like a scholar from a good family, more like a stable-boy.”\n\nAs she was speaking Jia Huan and Jia Lan arrived to pay their respects. Lady Xing told them to take chairs. When Jia Huan saw Baoyu sharing Lady Xing’s cushion and her petting him, he was very put out. After a little while he signalled to Jia Lan that they should leave. The boy had to comply and they rose to say goodbye.\n\nAs they were leaving Baoyu wanted to go with them, but Lady Xing said with a smile, “Do stay a bit longer. I’ve something to tell you.”\n\nBaoyu had to stay.\n\n“When you get back, give my regards to your mothers,” she told the other two. “All your aunts and cousins are here, and their noise is giving me a headache. I won’t keep you to a meal today.”\n\nJia Huan and the rest assented and left.\n\n“If all my cousins are here, how is it I don’t see them?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“After sitting here for a while they went to the back,” she told him.\n\n“What was it you wanted to tell me, aunt?”\n\n“Just that I want you to stay for a meal with the girls, and I’ve a toy for you to take home to play with.”\n\nAs they chatted the time for the evening meal arrived. The tables were laid and the young ladies invited in. After the meal Baoyu took his leave of Jia She and went home with his girl cousins. Having paid his respects to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang he went to his own room to rest. But no more of this.\n\nLet us return to Jia Yun, who went in to see Jia Lian and asked whether there was any news.\n\n“There was a job the other day,” said Jia Lian, “but your aunt begged and begged me to give it to Jia Qin, and she promised that when the next one turned up in the Garden, where more flowers and trees have to be planted, it would be yours.”\n\nAfter a moment’s reflection Jia Yun said, “In that case, uncle, I’ll wait. But don’t mention to my aunt that I came today to ask. I can bring it up again when the time comes.”\n\n“What’s the point of mentioning it?” retorted Jia Lian. “I’ve no time for such talk. I have to go to Xingyi tomorrow and must get back the same day. So just bide your time. Come for news the day after tomorrow after the first watch. Don’t come earlier, because I’ll be busy.” With that he went to change his clothes at the back.\n\nJia Yun left the Rong Mansion and started home. On the way an idea struck him and he went straight to his maternal uncle Bu Shiren’s house.\n\nJia Yun went to the back room where his maternal uncle Bu Shiren kept a spice shop. Having just returned from the shop, the latter asked, “What have you come for?”\n\n“I’ve a favour to ask you, uncle,” said Jia Yun. “I need some Borneo camphor and musk. Could you let me have four ounces of each on credit? I’ll pay you on the Mid-Autumn Festival.”\n\n“Don’t talk to me about credit,” snorted Bu Shiren. “The other day one of our assistants let a relation have a few taels’ worth of goods on credit and they still haven’t been paid for. We made up the loss between us and signed an agreement that from now on no one is to give credit to relatives or friends. Anyone who does will have to pay for a feast costing twenty taels. Besides, just at present we’re short of stock. Even if you paid cash you couldn’t get that much here. You’d have to go somewhere else.\n\n“Anyway, what do you want with such expensive stuff? I suppose you mean to go on the loose again. You complain that every time I see you I find fault. But you young fellows have no sense. You should make up your mind to do some work and earn some money, so as to have decent food and clothes. Then I’d be pleased.”\n\n“Quite right, uncle,” said Jia Yun with a smile. “When my father died I was too young to know anything. My mother tells me, though, that it was you who helped us with the funeral. You know how we’re placed. It’s not as if I’d squandered a fortune. ‘Even the cleverest housewife can’t make bread without flour.’ What am I to do? Luckily I’m not too shameless. If I were one of those impudent fellows who keep pestering their uncles for this and that, you’d find it even more of a nuisance.”\n\n“My boy, if I had anything to give, of course I would. I’m always saying to your aunt that I’m afraid you’ve no idea how to fend for yourself. Why don’t you bestir yourself? Even if you can’t see the masters in your mansion, you can humble yourself to have a talk with the stewards. Then you may get some charge. The other day when I left the city I ran into the fourth son of your third uncle, riding in a fine carriage with four or five carts behind him and forty or fifty monks and Taoists, going to your family temple. If he weren’t so capable, would he have been given such a job?”\n\nJia Yun, disgusted by this harangue, rose to take his leave.\n\n“What’s the hurry?” asked Bu Shiren. “Stay for a meal.”\n\nBefore the words were out of his mouth, his wife put in, “Have you no sense? We’ve no rice in the house. I bought half a catty of noodles to cook for you, and now you talk of asking our nephew to a meal. Are you going to let him go hungry?”\n\n“Then buy another half catty,” said her husband.\n\n“If you’ve no money, how can I buy anything?” she retorted. To her daughter she said, “Silver, go to Mrs. Wang next door and ask if she can lend us twenty or thirty cash. We’ll return them tomorrow.”\n\nWhile man and wife were talking, Jia Yun with a few polite remarks slipped away. Leaving this couple, let us follow Jia Yun who was walking home in a temper, his head lowered as he brooded. Suddenly he bumped into a drunken pedestrian who seized hold of him.\n\n“Are you blind?” swore the man. “Bumping into me like that!”\n\nThe voice sounded familiar. Looking closely Jia Yun saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er, a rowdy who lived by lending money at exorbitant rates and gambling. He was often drunk and looking for a fight. He had just been dunning a debtor and was in a drunken stupor when Jia Yun bumped into him and wanted to start a fight.\n\n“Hold on, Second Brother!” cried Jia Yun. “It’s my fault.”\n\nWhen Ni Er heard this and saw who it was, he relaxed his grip and staggered to his feet.\n\nChuckling he said, “So it’s Master Jia the Second. Where are you off to?”\n\n“Don’t ask me,” Jia Yun fumed. “For no reason I’ve just been insulted.”\n\n“Never mind. If anyone’s been bullying you, let me know and I’ll settle accounts with him. In the three streets and six lanes near by, who ever dares offend a neighbour of the Drunken Diamond? I’ll see to it that he’s ruined and his home destroyed!”\n\n“Don’t be angry, brother. Just listen to me.” Jia Yun then described how Bu Shiren had treated him.\n\n“If he weren’t a relation of yours, I’d curse him,” swore Ni Er. “Enough to make your blood boil! Well, don’t you worry. I’ve a few taels of silver here. You can have it if you like. We’re good friends, so I won’t charge you any interest.” As he spoke he drew a packet of silver from his purse.\n\n“Although Ni Er is a ruffian,” thought Jia Yun, “he treats people according to their deserts and has a reputation for helping the needy. If I refuse his offer today he may take offence, and that would be awkward. Better accept and repay him double later on.”\n\nSo he said with a smile, “Brother, you’re a real champion. Since you’re so good to me, how can I refuse? I’ll send you a regular IOU when I get home.”\n\n“This is only fifteen taels and three cents,” roared Ni Er. “If you talk about an IOU, I won’t lend it to you.”\n\nTaking the silver, Jia Yun replied, “In that case I’ll do as you say. Don’t be angry.”\n\n“That’s better. It’s dark now and I won’t keep you to have a drink. I’ve some business to attend to, so you must excuse me. Do me the favour of telling my family to bolt the gate and go to bed, as I shan’t be back tonight. If anything happens, my daughter can come first thing tomorrow to find me at the stable-keeper Short-Leg Wang’s.” Swaggering off as he spoke, he disappeared.\n\nThis unexpected encounter rather surprised Jia Yun, who reflected that Ni Er was a good fellow after all, but he was afraid the loan might have been made on the spur of the moment in a drunken fit, and that tomorrow the man might demand double the amount back. Then what should he do?\n\nAfter a moment’s thought he told himself, “Never mind. When my business is settled I can repay him twice over.” He went into a money-shop to have the silver weighed, and finding it correct was even more pleased. On his return he first gave Ni Er’s message to his wife, then went home. His mother was twisting thread on the kang.\n\n“Where have you been all day?” she asked.\n\nNot wanting to distress her by mentioning Bu Shiren, he simply said he had been waiting for his Uncle Lian in the West Mansion.\n\n“Have you had supper?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, I have. But there’s some left for you.” She told the maid to bring it to him.\n\nBy now the lamp was lit, and after eating Jia Yun went to bed. We need not dwell on the details of his night.\n\nThe next morning he washed, dressed, and went out. He walked to South Gate Street and bought some musk and camphor in a perfumery shop before proceeding to the Rong Mansion. Having ascertained that Jia Lian had gone out, he went to the back. At the gate of Jia Lian’s courtyard some pages with high brooms were sweeping the court. Suddenly Zhou Rui’s wife came out.\n\n“Don’t sweep yet,” she cried. “The mistress is coming out.”\n\nJia Yun hurried over to ask her, “Where is the Second Lady going?”\n\n“The old lady has sent for her. I expect it’s to cut out some clothes.”\n\nAs she spoke a crowd of matrons and maids emerged escorting Xifeng. Knowing her love of flattery and display, Jia Yun stepped forward respectfully, and with arms at his side paid his respects. Xifeng, however, did not so much as glance at him but walked on, merely asking as she passed how his mother was and why she never called.\n\n\"Just strolling around?\" Jia Yun replied. \"I'd have come before to pay my respects to you, aunt, but I've not been feeling well. So I've had to put it off.\"\n\n\"You know how to lie,\" she said laughingly. \"If I hadn't mentioned it, you wouldn't have thought of me.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, aunt! Would I dare tell a lie to an elder? Only yesterday evening I was speaking of you and said, 'Aunt Xifeng may look delicate but she has so much energy, she manages everything so well. If she were the least bit less capable, she'd be worn out.'\"\n\nXifeng beamed with delight and could not help stopping.\n\n\"Why should you and your mother gossip about me behind my back for no reason?\"\n\n\"My best friend, who's quite well off, owned a perfumery,\" he told her. \"But now that he's been made a sub-prefect and is leaving with his family for some prefecture in Yunnan, he's closing his shop. He's squared his accounts, paying what he owed and selling off his stock cheap. The more costly perfumes he's giving to relatives and friends, and that's how I came by some Borneo camphor and musk. I discussed with my mother what to do with it. It seemed a pity to sell it for a song, yet we'd no friends good enough to give it to. Then I remembered that in other years you used to pay high prices for such perfumes, and this year, what with the Imperial Consort's demands and the Dragon-Boat Festival as well, you're sure to need about ten times the usual amount. So I've brought you my small tribute.\"\n\nHe presented her with a brocade box.\n\nAs Xifeng happened to need perfume just then for the festival, she smiled and told Fenger, \"Take Master Yun's present home and give it to Pinger.\" She added to Jia Yun, \"So you have some sense after all. No wonder your uncle often speaks well of you and says you talk so sensibly and have good judgment.\"\n\nThis was Jia Yun's cue. \"Does uncle often mention me?\" he asked.\n\nXifeng was tempted to tell him then and there of the job in store for him, but reflected that if she did he might think her too easily won over by a little perfume. So she said no more about the planting of trees, just chatted for a while before going on to the Lady Dowager's quarters.\n\nJia Yun could hardly raise the subject himself. He had to go home. But having seen Baoyu the previous day in the outer study, he went back after his meal to Qisan Studio inside the ceremonial gate leading to the Lady Dowager's compound. He found Mingyan there playing with a sparrow. Stealing up behind him Jia Yun coughed.\n\n\"Mingyan, you young rascal! Up to your tricks again?\"\n\nThe boy turned and, seeing who it was, protested, \"What did you want to scare me like that for, sir?\" He added with a grin, \"I'm not called Mingyan any more. Our Baoyu doesn't like the word yan 'smoke,' so he's changed it to Beiming. Please call me that in future, sir.\"\n\nJia Yun nodded and accompanied him into the study, where he sat down and asked, \"Has Master Bao come back yet?\"\n\n\"Not so far today. If you've a message, sir, I'll go to find out for you.\"\n\nWith that he went off.\n\nJia Yun amused himself by looking at the paintings and curios. He waited for what seemed the time to eat a meal, but still Baoyu did not come. When he looked around for the other pages, they had all gone out to amuse themselves. He was feeling most put out when a girl's voice cried sweetly outside, \"Brother!\"\n\nJia Yun looked out and saw a maid of fifteen or sixteen, rather attractive with sparkling eyes. At sight of him she turned to slip away, just as Beiming came back.\n\n\"Good, here's someone to take a message!\" he cried.\n\nAt that, Jia Yun hurried out too and asked, \"Well?\"\n\n“I waited a long time but no one came past,” said Beiming. “This is Master Bao’s apartment.” He went on, “Be a good girl and take a message for us. Just say that the young gentleman from the lane is here.”\n\nHearing that this was one of the Jia family, the maid did not avoid them as she had been doing but stared hard at Jia Yun. And now Jia Yun interposed:\n\n“What’s all this about ‘the young gentleman from the lane’? Just say it’s Yun.”\n\nAfter a pause the maid gave a faint smile.\n\n“If you’ll take my advice, sir, you’d better go home now and come back tomorrow. I’ll give him your message this evening when I’ve time.”\n\n“What’s the idea?” asked Beiming.\n\n“He didn’t take a nap today, so he’ll have his evening meal early and won’t be coming down again. I can’t leave you waiting here with empty stomachs, can I? You’d do better to go home and come back tomorrow. That’s the best way. Even if I were to give him a message now, he’d only say ‘All right’ — that’s all.”\n\nJia Yun was impressed by the girl’s concise and lively way of talking. He would have liked to ask her name, but felt it would be presumptuous since she worked for Baoyu. He merely said:\n\n“You’re right. I’ll come back tomorrow.”\n\nWith that he started away.\n\n“Let me fetch you some tea first,” offered Beiming.\n\nStill walking, Jia Yun looked back to say, “No, thanks. I’ve business to attend to.” But his eyes were on the maid, who was still standing there.\n\nJia Yun went straight home. The next day he came again to the main gate and happened to meet Xifeng, who had just got into her carriage to go and pay her respects to Lady Wang. She ordered the carriage to halt when she saw him and, smiling out of the window, said:\n\n“So you’re up to your tricks with me, Yun! No wonder you made me a present. So you want me to do something for you. Your uncle told me yesterday that you’d been asking a favour of him.”\n\n“Please don’t talk about that, aunt,” he said with a smile. “I’m sorry I ever asked him. If I’d known better, I’d have asked you in the first place and the job would have been fixed up long ago. It’s no use relying on uncle.”\n\n“Oh!” She smiled. “So you couldn’t get round him and you’ve come to me now?”\n\n“You’re doing me an injustice, aunt. That wasn’t my idea. If it had been, wouldn’t I have asked you yesterday? Now that you know, though, I’ll forget uncle and ask you to show me some kindness.”\n\n“You do choose roundabout ways.” Xifeng snorted. “If you’d told me earlier, such a trifle wouldn’t have been delayed all this time. We’re still looking for someone to plant trees and flowers in the garden. If you’d spoken up, it would have been settled long ago.”\n\n“In that case, can you assign the job to me tomorrow, aunt?”\n\nAfter a moment’s reflection she said, “I don’t really think that would do. Wait till next year when we set off the fireworks at the Lantern Festival, then I’ll give you a commission.”\n\n“Do be a dear, aunt, and give me this one first. If I make a good job of it, you can give me the other later.”\n\nXifeng laughed.\n\n“You certainly know how to keep a line out for big fish. Well, all right. If your uncle hadn’t mentioned it, I wouldn’t have bothered. I’m going over now after my meal. Come for the money in the afternoon and you can start your planting the day after tomorrow.”\n\nWith that she ordered the servants to drive on.\n\nJia Yun was overjoyed. He went to Happy Red Court to see Baoyu, only to learn that Baoyu had gone first thing to the Northern Prince’s palace. So he sat there disconsolately till noon, when he heard that Xifeng was back. He went to draw up a requisition, then took it to her office to collect a tally. When he announced himself outside the courtyard, Caiming came out and took the form. He went in to have the amount and date entered on it, then brought it out with the tally and gave them to Jia Yun. He saw that two hundred taels of silver were authorized.\n\nJia Yun, in high spirits, went to the treasury for the money and brought it home to show his mother, naturally giving her great satisfaction. The next day at dawn he called on Ni Er to repay his loan, then took fifty taels of silver to the flower nursery outside the West Gate run by Fang Chun to buy trees. But no more of this.\n\nAfter Baoyu’s promise the previous day to have Jia Yun in for a talk, he had clean forgotten about it. Such is the way of wealthy young noblemen. That evening, on his return from the Northern Prince’s palace, he paid his respects to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang before going back to the Garden. Having changed his clothes, he was about to bathe when Hsi-jen was asked by Pao-chai to help her with some knotting, while Chiu-wen and Pi-hen had gone to fetch water. Tan-yun’s mother had come to ask leave because she was ill, and Sheh-yueh was now at home on sick leave. The other maids had all slipped out to amuse themselves, knowing that the few hard-working ones left could not be called on for such light duties. And so, for the moment, Baoyu was alone in his room.\n\nAs luck would have it, he fancied some tea and called several times, but all that appeared were two or three old nannies.\n\n“No, no, never mind,” said Baoyu with a wave of his hand, and the old women withdrew.\n\nSince there was no one else to wait on him, he had to fetch a cup and pour the tea himself. Then he heard someone behind him say:\n\n“Let me pour it for you, master, or you may scald your hand.”\n\nAs she spoke she stepped forward to take the cup. Baoyu started.\n\n“Where did you spring from?” he exclaimed. “What a start you gave me!”\n\nSmiling, the maid handed him the tea and answered, “I was in the back courtyard. I came in by the back door. Didn’t you hear me, master?”\n\nBaoyu sipped his tea as he looked her over. She was wearing a none too new red jacket and a green silk sleeveless jacket. although her skirt was rather worn, he noticed that she had jet-black hair, a shapely white face and a slender, graceful figure. Charming and demure.\n\n“Are you one of my maids?” he asked with a smile.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then how is it I’ve never seen you before?”\n\nShe gave a cynical laugh.\n\n“There are plenty of us you’ve never seen, master, not just me. I’ve never even handed you tea or water or brought anything in, so how could you know me?”\n\n“Why don’t you do things for me, then?”\n\n“That’s hard to say. I’ve a message for you, though, master. Yesterday some boy called Yun called. I thought you might be too busy to see him, so I told Pei-ming to take him a message. He came again today, but you were out.”\n\nJust then Chiu-wen and Pi-hen came back laughing and splashing, each holding one handle of a bucket of water. They were holding up their clothes with one hand and reeling along. The young maid hurried out to take the water from them.\n\nChiu-wen and Pi-hen were complaining, “You’ve splashed my dress.” “You’ve trodden on my shoes.” Then, seeing someone run out to help, they stopped in surprise. It was no other than Hsiao-hung. They put down the water and went inside. When they found Baoyu alone they were not best pleased, but had to go ahead and prepare his bath. Once Baoyu had stripped, they closed the door behind them and went to look for Hsiao-hong.\n\n“What were you doing in the room just now?” they demanded.\n\n“How could I be in there?” she retorted. “I couldn’t find my handkerchief and went to the back to look for it. Then Master Pao wanted some tea and called for you, but there wasn’t a soul in sight. So I ran in to pour him a cup. Then you two came back.”\n\n‘Here she is!’ said Qiuwen, spitting contemptuously in her direction. ‘The shameless little bitch! You’re supposed to be fetching water. You said you were busy, so we went instead; but you managed to sneak in here and do this little job! You’re nothing but a creeping, crawling thing. Do you think we’re not good enough to keep up with you? You ought to take a look at yourself in the mirror. A fine one you are to be serving the Master his tea!’\n\n‘Tomorrow I shall tell them that whenever there’s any fetching or carrying to be done, we’re not to do it,’ said Bihen. ‘We’ll just tell them to get her to do it.’\n\n‘If it’s like that,’ said Qiuwen, ‘we might as well all clear out and leave her here on her own.’\n\nWhile the two of them were still talking at her in this unpleasant manner, an old nanny came in with a message from Xi-feng.\n\n‘They’ll be bringing the gardeners in to do the planting tomorrow,’ she said. ‘You’re to be very careful. You’re not to hang your washing about all over the place. There are screens all round the rockery, so mind you don’t go running around there.’\n\n‘Who is it that’s bringing the workmen in to do the job?’ said Qiuwen.\n\n‘Young Jia Yun from the back lane,’ said the old woman.\n\nNeither Qiuwen nor Bihen had ever heard of him and asked a lot of confused questions. But Crimson knew. It was the young man she had seen the day before in the outer study.\n\nCrimson’s original name was Red Jade. She had been re-named ‘Crimson’ to avoid the ‘Jade’ in Bao-yu and Dai-yu’s names. She was the daughter of one of the hereditary retainers of the mansion. Her father was at present in charge of all the farms and estate property belonging to the family. She had been assigned to the House of Green Delights when she entered the mansion two years before at the age of fourteen. At that time Bao-yu had still been living with Grandmother Jia and the place had been very quiet. But then the decision had been taken that the young people should move into the Garden, and by a singular mischance Bao-yu had chosen to live in the House of Green Delights. Although Crimson was still rather young and inexperienced, she was quite a presentable girl and had for some time been nursing a private ambition to better herself. She had often thought of insinuating herself into Bao-yu’s favour, but his attendants were such a clever and pushy lot that she had never yet found an opportunity of doing so. Today’s little incident had seemed to promise a breakthrough; but the unpleasantness with Qiuwen and the others had been a severe discouragement and she was feeling very dejected. She was still smarting from it when the old nanny’s mention of Jia Yun caused a little flutter in her heart. She went back to her room in a state of depression and lay down on her bed to think. For a long time she tossed and turned restlessly, unable to get to sleep. Suddenly a voice outside the window called to her softly:\n\n‘Miss Crimson! I’ve found your handkerchief.’\n\nCrimson ran outside to look. It was Jia Yun. She blushed scarlet.\n\n‘Where did you find it, Mr Yun?’\n\nJia Yun laughed.\n\n‘Come over here and I’ll tell you.’\n\nHe made a grab at her clothing. Crimson, who was overcome with confusion, turned to escape, but caught her foot on the threshold and fell.\n\nBut if you wish to know the outcome, you will have to read the following chapter."
