  "original": "话说贾琏拿了那块假玉忿忿走出，到了书房。那个人看见贾琏的气色不好，心里先发了虚了，连忙站起来迎着。刚要说话，只见贾琏冷笑道：“好大胆，我把你这个混账东西！这里是什么地方儿，你敢来掉鬼！”回头便问：“小厮们呢？”外头轰雷一般，几个小厮齐声答应。贾琏道：“取绳子去捆起他来！等老爷回来回明了，把他送到衙门里去。”众小厮又一齐答应：“预备着呢。”嘴里虽如此，却不动身。那人先唬的手足无措，见这般势派，知道难逃公道，只得跪下给贾琏碰头，一口声声只叫：“老太爷别生气！是我一时穷极无奈，才想出这个没脸的营生来。那玉是我借钱做的，我也不敢要了，只得孝敬府里的哥儿玩罢。”说毕，又连连磕头。贾琏啐道：“你这个不知死活的东西！这府里希罕你的那扔不了的浪东西！”正闹着，只见赖大进来，陪着笑向贾琏道：“二爷别生气了。靠他算个什么东西！饶了他，叫他滚出去罢。”贾琏道：“实在可恶！”赖大、贾琏作好作歹，众人在外头都说道：“糊涂狗攮的，还不给爷和赖大爷磕头呢！快快的滚罢，还等窝心脚呢。”那人赶忙磕了两个头，抱头鼠窜而去。从此，街上闹动了：“贾宝玉弄出‘假宝玉’来。”\n　　且说贾政那日拜客回来，众人因为灯节底下，恐怕贾政生气，巳过去的事了，便也都不肯回。只因元妃的事，忙碌了好些时、近日宝玉又病着，虽有旧例家宴，大家无兴、也无有可记之事。\n　　到了正月十七日，王夫人正盼王子腾来京，只见凤姐进来回说：“今日二爷在外听得有人传说：我们家大老爷赶着进京，离城只二百多里地，在路上没了！太太听见了没有？”王夫人吃惊道：“我没有听见，老爷昨晚也没有说起。到底在那里听见的？”凤姐道：“说是在枢密张老爷家听见的。”王夫人怔了半天，那眼泪早流下来了，因拭泪说道：“回来再叫琏儿索性打听明白了来告诉我。”凤姐答应去了。\n　　王夫人不免暗里落泪，悲女哭弟，又为宝玉耽忧。如此连三接二，都是不随意的事，那里搁得住？便有些心口疼痛起来。又加贾琏打听明白了，来说道：“舅太爷是赶路劳乏，偶然感冒风寒，到了十里屯地方，延医调治，无奈这个地方没有名医，误用了药，一剂就死了。但不知家眷可到了那里没有。”王夫人听了，一阵心酸，便心口疼得坐不住，叫彩云等扶了上炕，还扎挣看叫贾琏去回了贾政：“即速收拾行装，迎到那里，帮着料理完毕，即刻回来告诉我们，好叫你媳妇儿放心。”贾琏不敢违拗，只得辞了贾政起身。\n　　贾政早已知道，心里很不受用，又知宝玉失玉以后，神志昏愦，医药无效，又值王夫人心疼。那年正值京察，工部将贾政保列一等，二月，吏部带领引见。皇上念贾政勤俭谨慎，即放了江西粮道。即日谢恩，已奏明起程日期。虽有众亲朋贺喜，贾政也无心应酬。只念家中人口不宁，又不敢耽延在家。正在无计可施，只听见贾母那边叫：“请老爷。”贾政即忙进去。看见王夫人带着病也在那里，便向贾母请了安。贾母叫他坐下，便说：“你不日就要赴任，我有多少话与你说，不知你听不听？”说着掉下泪来。贾政忙站起来，说道：“老太太有话，只管吩咐，儿子怎敢不遵命呢？”贾母哽咽着说道：“我今年八十一岁的人了，你又要做外任去。偏有你大哥在家，你又不能告亲老。你这一去了，我所疼的只有宝玉，偏偏的又病得糊涂，还不知道怎么样呢！我昨日叫赖升媳妇出去叫人给宝玉算算命，这先生算得好灵，说：‘要娶了金命的人帮扶他，必要冲冲喜才好，不然只怕保不住。’我知道你不信那些话，所以教你来商量。你的媳妇也在这里，你们两个也商量商量，还是要宝玉好呢？还是随他去呢？”贾政陪笑说道：“老太太当初疼儿子这么疼的，难道做儿子的就不疼自己的儿子不成么？只为宝玉不上进，所以时常恨他，也不过是‘恨铁不成钢’的意思。老太太既要给他成家，这也是该当的，岂有逆着老太太不疼他的理？如今宝玉病着，儿子也是不放心。因老太太不叫他见我，所以儿子也不敢言语。我到底瞧瞧宝玉是个什么病？”\n    王夫人见贾政说着也有些眼圈儿红，知道心里是疼的，便叫袭人扶了宝玉来。宝玉见了他父亲，袭人叫他请安，他便请了个安。贾政见他脸面很瘦，目光无神，大有疯傻之状，便叫人扶了进去，便想到：“自己也是望六的人了，如今又放外任，不知道几年回来。倘或这孩子果然不好，一则年老无嗣，虽说有孙子，到底隔了一层；二则老太太最疼的是宝玉，若有差错，可不是我的罪名更重了？”瞧瞧王夫人一包眼泪，又想到他身上，复站起来说：“老太太这么大年纪，想法儿疼孙子，做儿子的还敢违拗？老太太主意该怎么便怎么就是了。但只姨太太那边不知说明白了没有。”王夫人便道：“姨太太是早应了的，只为蟠儿的事没有结案，所以这些时总没提起。”贾政又道：这就是第一层的难处。他哥哥在监里，妹子怎么出嫁？况且贵妃的事虽不禁婚嫁，宝玉应照已出嫁的姐姐，有九个月的功服，此时也难娶亲。再者，我的起身日期已经奏明，不敢耽搁，这几天怎么办呢？”贾母想了一想：“说的果然不错。若是等这几件事过去，他父亲又走了，倘或这病一天重似一天，怎么好？只可越些礼办了才好。”想定主意，便说道：“你若给他办呢，我自然有个道理，包管都碍不着：姨太太那边，我和你媳妇亲自过去求他。蟠儿那里，我央蝌儿去告诉他，说是要救宝玉的命，诸事将就，自然应的。若说服里娶亲，当真使不得；况且宝玉病着，也不可叫他成亲，不过是冲冲喜。我们两家愿意，孩子们又有‘金玉’的道理，婚是不用合的了，即挑了好日子，按着咱们家分儿过了礼。趁着挑个娶亲日子，一概鼓乐不用，倒按宫里的样子，用十二对提灯，一乘八人轿子抬了来，照南边规矩拜了堂，一样坐床撒帐，可不是算娶了亲了么？宝丫头心地明白，是不用虑的。内中又有袭人，也还是个妥妥当当的孩子，再有个明白人常劝他，更好。他又和宝丫头合的来。再者，姨太太曾说：‘宝丫头的金锁也有个和尚说过，只等有玉的便是婚姻。’焉知宝丫头过来，不因金锁倒招出他那块玉来，也定不得。从此一天好似一天，岂不是大家的造化？这会子只要立刻收拾屋子，铺排起来，这屋子是要你派的。一概亲友不请，也不排筵席。待宝玉好了，过了功服，然后再摆席请人。这么着，都赶的上，你也看见了他们小两口儿的事，也好放心着去。”\n    贾政听了，原不愿意，只是贾母做主，不敢违命，勉强陪笑说道：“老太太想得极是，也很妥当。只是要吩咐家下众人，不许吵嚷得里外皆知，这要耽不是的。姨太太那边只怕不肯，若是果真应了，也只好按着老太太的主意办去。”贾母道：“姨太太那里有我呢，你去罢。”贾政答应出来，心中好不自在。因赴任事多，部里领凭，亲友们荐人，种种应酬不绝，竟把宝玉的事听凭贾母交与王夫人凤姐儿了。惟将荣禧堂后身王夫人内屋旁边一大跨所二十余间房屋指与宝玉，余者一概不管。贾母定了主意，叫人告诉他去，贾政只说“很好”。此是后话。\n　　且说宝玉见过贾政，袭人扶回里间炕上。因贾政在外，无人敢与宝玉说话，宝玉便昏昏沉沉的睡去，贾母与贾政所说的话，宝玉一句也没有听见。袭人等却静静儿的听得明白。头里虽也听得些风声，到底影响，只不见宝钗过来，却也有些信真。今日听了这些话，心里方才水落归漕，倒也喜欢。心里想道：“果然上头的眼力不错，这才配的是，我也造化！若他来了，我可以卸了好些担子。但是这一位的心里只有一个林姑娘，幸亏他没有听见，若知道了，又不知要闹到什么分儿了。”袭人想到这里，转喜为悲，心想：“这件事怎么好？老太太、太太那里知道他们心里的事？一时高兴，说给他知道，原想要他病好。若是他还象头里的心，初见林姑娘，便要摔玉砸玉；况且那年夏天在园里，把我当作林姑娘，说了好些私心话；后来因为紫鹃说了句玩话儿，便哭得死去活来。若是如今和他说要娶宝姑娘，竟把林姑娘撂开，除非是他人事不知还可，倘或明白些，只怕不但不能冲喜，竟是催命了。我再不把话说明，那不是一害三个人了么？”袭人想定主意，待等贾政出去，叫秋纹照看着宝玉，便从里间出来，走到王夫人身旁，悄悄的请了王夫人到贾母后身屋里去说话。贾母只道是宝玉有话，也不理会，还在那里打算怎么过礼，怎么娶亲。\n　　那袭人同了王夫人到了后间，便跪下哭了。王夫人不知何意，把手拉着他说：“好端端的，这是怎么说？有什么委屈，起来说。”袭人道：“这话奴才是不该说的，这会子因为没有法儿了！”王夫人道：“你慢慢的说。”袭人道：“宝玉的亲事，老太太、太太已定了宝姑娘了，自然是极好的一件事。只是奴才想着，太太看去，宝玉和宝姑娘好，还是和林姑娘好呢？”王夫人道：“他两个因从小儿在一处，所以宝玉和林姑娘又好些。”袭人道：“不是‘好些’。”便将宝玉素与黛玉这些光景一一的说了，还说：“这些事都是太太亲眼见的，独是夏天的话，我从没敢和别人说。”王夫人拉着袭人道：“我看外面儿已瞧出几分来了，你今儿一说，更加是了。但是刚才老爷说的话，想必都听见了，你看他的神情儿怎么样？”袭人道：“如今宝玉若有人和他说话他就笑，没人和他说话他就睡，所以头里的话却倒都没听见。”王夫人道：“倒是这件事叫人怎么样呢？”袭人道：“奴才说是说了，还得太太告诉老太太，想个万全的主意才好。”王夫人便道：“既这么着，你去干你的。这时候满屋子的人，暂且不用提起。等我瞅空儿回明老太太再作道理。”\n　　说着，仍到贾母跟前。贾母正在那里和凤姐儿商议，见王夫人进来，便问道：“袭人丫头说什么，这么鬼鬼祟祟的？”王夫人趁问，便将宝玉的心事细细回明贾母。贾母听了，半日没言语。王夫人和凤姐也都不再说了。只见贾母叹道：“别的事都好说。林丫头倒没有什么。若宝玉真是这样，这可叫人作了难了。”只见凤姐想了一想，因说道：“难倒不难。只是我想了个主意，不知姑妈肯不肯。”王夫人道：“你有主意，只管说给老太太听，大家娘儿们商量着办罢了。”凤姐道：“依我想，这件事，只有一个‘掉包儿’的法子。”贾母道：“怎么‘掉包儿’？”凤姐道：“如今不管宝兄弟明白不明白，大家吵嚷起来，说是老爷做主，将林姑娘配了他了，瞧他的神情儿怎么样。要是他全不管，这个包儿也就不用掉了。若是他有些喜欢的意思，这事却要大费周折呢。”王夫人道：“就算他喜欢，你怎么样办法呢？”凤姐走到王夫人耳边，如此这般的说了一遍。王夫人点了几点头儿，笑了一笑，说道：“也罢了。”贾母便问道：“你们娘儿两个捣鬼，到底告诉我是怎么着呀。”凤姐恐贾母不懂，露泄机关，便也向耳边轻轻告诉了一遍。贾母果真一时不懂。凤姐笑着又说了几句。贾母笑道：“这么着也好，可就只忒苦了宝丫头了。倘或吵嚷出来，林丫头又怎么样呢？”凤姐道：“这个话，原只说给宝玉听，外头一概不许提起，有谁知道呢？”\n　　正说间，丫头传进话来，说：“琏二爷回来了。”王夫人恐贾母问及，使个眼色与凤姐。凤姐便出来迎着贾琏，努了个嘴儿，同到王夫人屋里等着去了。一会儿，王夫人进来，已见凤姐哭的两眼通红。贾琏请了安，将到十里屯料理王子腾的丧事的话说了一遍，便说：“有恩旨赏了内阁的职衔，谥了文勤公，命本家扶柩回籍，着沿途地方宫员照料。昨日起身，连家眷回南去了。舅太太叫我回来请安问好，说：‘如今想不到不能进京，有多少话不能说。听见我大舅子要进京，若是路上遇见了，便叫他来到咱们这里细细的说。’”王夫人听毕，其悲痛自不必言。凤姐劝慰了一番，“请太太略歇一歇，晚上来，再商量宝玉的事罢。”说毕，同了贾琏回到自己房中，告诉了贾琏，叫他派人收拾新房不提。\n　　一日，黛玉早饭后，带着紫鹃到贾母这边来，一则请安，二则也为自己散散闷。出了潇湘馆，走了几步，忽然想起忘了手绢子来，因叫紫鹃回去取来，自己却慢慢的走着等他。刚走到沁芳桥那边山石背后当日同宝玉葬花之处，忽听一个人呜呜咽咽在那里哭。黛玉煞住脚听时，又听不出是谁的声音，也听不出哭的叨叨的是些什么话。心里甚是疑惑，便慢慢走去。及到了跟前，却见一个浓眉大眼的丫头在那里哭呢。黛玉未见他时，还只疑府里这些大丫头有什么说不出的心事，所以来这里发泄发泄；及至见了这个丫头，却又好笑，因想到：“这种蠢货，有什么情种。自然是那屋里作粗活的丫头，受了大女孩子的气了。”细瞧了一瞧，却不认得。\n　　那丫头见黛玉来了，便也不敢再哭，站起来拭眼泪。黛玉问道：“你好好的为什么在这里伤心？”那丫头听了这话、又流泪道：“林姑娘，你评评这个理。他们说话，我又不知道，我就说错了一句话，我姐姐也不犯就打我呀。”黛玉听了，不懂他说的是什么，因笑问道：“你姐姐是那一个？”那丫头道：“就是珍珠姐姐。”黛玉听了，才知他是贾母屋里的。因又问：“你叫什么？”那丫头道：“我叫傻大姐儿。”黛玉笑了一笑，又问：“你姐姐为什么打你？你说错了什么话了？”那丫头道：“为什么呢，就是为我们宝二爷娶宝姑娘的事情。”黛玉听了这句话，如同一个疾雷，心头乱跳，略定了定神，便叫这丫头：“你跟了我这里来。”那丫头跟着黛玉到那畸角儿上葬桃花的去处，那里背静，黛玉因问道：“宝二爷娶宝姑娘，他为什么打你呢？”傻大姐道：“我们老太太和太太、二奶奶商量了，因为我们老爷要起身，说：就赶着往姨太太商量，把宝姑娘娶过来罢。头一宗，给宝二爷冲什么喜；第二宗……”说到这里，又瞅着黛玉笑了一笑，才说道：“赶着办了，还要给林姑娘说婆婆家呢。”\n　　黛玉已经听呆了。这丫头只管说道：“我又不知道他们怎么商量的，不叫人吵嚷，怕宝姑娘听见害躁。我白和宝二爷屋里的袭人姐姐说了一句：‘咱们明儿更热闹了，又是宝姑娘，又是宝二奶奶，这可怎么叫呢？’林姑娘，你说我这话害着珍珠姐姐什么了吗？他走过来就打了我一个嘴巴，说我混说，不遵上头的话，要撵出我去。——我知道上头为什么不叫言语呢？你们又没告诉我，就打我。”说着，又哭起来。\n　　那黛玉此时心里，竟是油儿、酱儿、糖儿、醋儿倒在一处的一般，甜、苦、酸、咸，竟说不上什么味儿来了。停了一会儿，颤巍巍的说道：“你别混说了。你再混说，叫人听见，又要打你了。你去罢。”说着，自己转身要回潇湘馆去。那身子竟有千百斤重的，两只脚却象踩着棉花一般，早已软了。只得一步一步慢慢的走将来。走了半天，还没到沁芳桥畔。原来脚下软了，走的慢，且又迷迷痴痴，信着脚儿从那边绕过来，更添了两箭地的路。这时刚到沁芳桥畔，却又不知不觉的顺着堤往回里走起来。紫鹃取了绢子来，不见黛玉。正在那里看时，只见黛玉颜色雪白，身子恍恍荡荡的，眼睛也直直的，在那里东转西转。又见一个丫头往前头走了，离的远也看不出是那一个来，心中惊疑不定，只得赶过来，轻轻的问道：“姑娘，怎么又回去？是要往那里去？”黛玉也只模糊听见，随一应道：“我问问宝玉去。”紫鹃听了，摸不着头脑，只得搀着他到贾母这边来。\n　　黛玉走到贾母门口，心里似觉明晰，回头看见紫鹃搀着自己，便站住了，问道：“你作什么来的？”紫鹃陪笑道：“我找了绢子来了。头里见姑娘在桥那边呢，我赶着过去问姑娘，姑娘没理会。”黛玉笑道：“我打量你来瞧宝二爷来了呢，不然，怎么往这里走呢？”紫鹃见他心里迷惑，便知黛玉必是听见那丫头什么话来，惟有点头微笑而已。只是心里怕他见了宝玉，那一个已经是疯疯傻傻，这一个又这样恍恍惚惚，一时说出些不大体统的话来，那时如何是好？心里虽如此想，却也不敢违拗，只得搀他进去。\n　　那黛玉却又奇怪，这时不是先前那样软了，也不用紫鹃打帘子，自己掀起帘子进来。却是寂然无声，因贾母在屋里歇中觉，丫头们也有脱滑儿玩去的，也有打盹的，也有在那里伺候老太太的。倒是袭人听见帘子响，从屋里出来一看，见是黛玉，便让道：“姑娘，屋里坐罢。”黛玉笑着道：“宝二爷在家么？”袭人不知底里，刚要答言，只见紫鹃在黛玉身后和他努嘴儿，指着黛玉，又摇摇手儿。袭人不解何意，也不敢言语。黛玉却也不理会，自己走进房来。看见宝玉在那里坐着，也不起来让坐，只瞅着嘻嘻的傻笑。黛玉自己坐下，却也瞅着宝玉笑。两个人也不问好，也不说话，也无推让，只管对着脸傻笑起来。袭人看见这番光景，心里大不得主意，只是没法儿。忽然听着黛玉说道：“宝玉，你为什么病了？”宝玉笑道：“我为林姑娘病了。”袭人紫鹃两个吓得面目改色，连忙用言语来岔。两个却又不答言，仍旧傻笑起来。袭人见了这样，知道黛玉此时心中迷惑，和宝玉一样，因悄和紫鹃说道：“姑娘才好了，我叫秋纹妹妹同着你搀回姑娘，歇歇去罢。”因回头向秋纹道：“你和紫鹃姐姐送林姑娘去罢，你可别混说话。”秋纹笑着也不言语，便来同着紫鹃搀起黛玉。那黛玉也就站起来，瞅着宝玉只管笑，只管点头儿。紫鹃又催道：“姑娘，回家去歇歇罢。”黛玉道：“可不是，我这就是回去的时候儿了。”说着，便回身笑着出来了，仍旧不用丫头们搀扶，自己却走得比往常飞快。紫鹃秋纹后面赶忙跟着走。\n    黛玉出了贾母院门，只管一直走去，紫鹃连忙搀住，叫道：“姑娘，往这么来。”黛玉仍是笑着，随了往潇湘馆来。离门一不远，紫鹃道：“阿弥陀佛，可到了家了。”只这一句话没说完，只见黛玉身子往前一栽，“哇”的一声，一口血直吐出来。\n未知性命如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jia Lian, in a rage at the discovery that the jade was a fake, went back to his study with it. The man who had brought it, seeing how angry he was, was already quaking in his boots and rose to his feet to greet him with a bow. Before he could say a word, however, Jia Lian sneered:\n\n“You’ve got a nerve, you scoundrel! How dare you play such a trick in a house like this!” He turned to ask, “Where are the men?” Several pages outside answered with a loud cry, and he ordered, “Fetch a rope and truss him up. When the master comes home, we’ll report this to him and have the fellow sent to the yamen.”\n\n“Yes, sir!” chorused the pages, though none of them moved.\n\nThe man, scared out of his wits by this commotion and seeing that he was in for trouble, fell on his knees to kowtow to Jia Lian.\n\n“Don’t be angry, sir!” he begged. “I was so hard up, I’d no way out but to think of this dirty trick. I borrowed money to have that jade made, but now I daren’t ask for payment. Please keep it for the young master to play with.” He kowtowed again and again.\n\nJia Lian spat in disgust, “You fool! D’you think we need your worthless junk here?”\n\nIn the midst of this commotion in came Lai Da who said with a conciliatory smile, “Don’t be angry, Master Lian. He isn’t worth bothering about. Do let him off and tell him to clear out.”\n\n“The wretch is too outrageous!”\n\nLai Da and Jia Lian then seemed to be having an argument, while the servants outside called, “You stupid dog! Why don’t you kowtow to the masters? Clear out quick, unless you want a kick in the pants!”\n\nThe man hastily kowtowed twice to them, then picked up his jade and scuttled away. And after this, the story spread through the streets that Baoyu’s jade had turned out to be false.\n\nTo return to Jia Zheng, the day he came back from calling on friends, as it was the middle of the Lantern Festival his household were afraid he might be angry and so said nothing to him about what had happened, especially as they had been busy for some time over the Imperial Consort’s death and Baoyu’s illness. Although the family feast that year followed the old custom, no one was in the mood for enjoyment and nothing of note occurred.\n\nOn the seventeenth, Lady Wang was expecting her brother Wang Ziteng to the capital when Xifeng came in to announce, “Just now my husband heard outside that our uncle is hurrying to the capital, but he died on the way when only two hundred li from the city! Have you heard that, madam?”\n\n“No,” gasped Lady Wang, aghast. “The master didn’t mention it yesterday. Where did this news come from?”\n\n“They say Secretary Zhang’s family heard it.”\n\nLady Wang was speechless. Her tears had already begun to fall. Finally, wiping her eyes, she said, “Tell Lian to go and find out the facts, then report to me.”\n\nXifeng assented and left.\n\nLady Wang wept in private, grieving for her daughter and now her brother, as well as worrying about Baoyu. These repeated blows were more than she could bear, and she felt a pain in her heart. When Jia Lian came back after making enquiries to tell her, “Our uncle was worn out by the journey and caught a chill. They called in doctors at Shilitun, but as there were no good ones there they prescribed the wrong treatment and the very first dose carried him off. We don’t know yet whether his family have reached the place or not,” this news made her so sad that the pain in her heart became unbearable. She had to ask Caiyun and the other maids to help her on to the kang, and insisted that Jia Lian must go to inform Jia Zheng.\n\n“Get ready at once and go to meet the funeral procession,” she said. “Help to make all arrangements there, then come straight back to let us know so that your wife can stop worrying.”\n\nJia Lian dared not disobey but had to take his leave of Jia Zheng and set out.\n\nJia Zheng had already heard the news and was very upset. He was also worried by the loss of Baoyu’s jade...\n\nHis mind was deranged, and medicine proved useless. In addition, Lady Wang was unwell with heart pains. That year the metropolitan officials were being evaluated, and the Ministry of Works had commended Jia Zheng as first grade. In the second month, the Ministry of Civil Affairs arranged an audience for him with the Emperor, who in view of his diligence, frugality and prudence appointed him as Grain Intendant of Jiangxi. Jia Zheng that same day expressed his gratitude for this favour and named the day of his departure. Although relatives and friends came to congratulate him, he was in no mood to entertain them, being too worried about the troubles in his household. Yet he dared not delay his departure.\n\nHe was at a loss what to do when the Lady Dowager sent for him. He hurried over and found Lady Wang there too, although she was unwell. Having paid his respects to his mother he was told to take a seat.\n\n“You will be leaving for your post any day now,” she said. “I have a great deal to say to you, but I don’t know if you’ll agree.”\n\nAs she spoke she shed tears.\n\nJia Zheng rose respectfully to his feet.\n\n“Whatever instructions you have, madam, just give them,” he said. “How dare your son disobey you?”\n\nChoking with sobs she told him, “I am eighty-one this year, and you are being sent to the provinces. You have an elder brother at home, but he is not in a position to ask for retirement on account of his parents’ age. Once you have gone, the one I love best is Baoyu, but he has suddenly fallen so dangerously ill that we don’t know whether he will live or die. Yesterday I sent Laishing’s wife to get a fortune-teller to cast his horoscope. That man predicts very accurately. He says Baoyu must marry someone whose destiny is founded on metal to help him and that the wedding must be soon to avert disaster — otherwise his life may not be saved. I know you don’t believe in such talk; that’s why I asked you here to discuss it. Your wife is here too. You must talk it over. Should we try to save Baoyu? Or let things take their course and not trouble about him?”\n\nJia Zheng smiled apologetically.\n\n“As you were so good to me, madam, how can I not care for my own son? It is simply because Baoyu is so undutiful that I’ve often been angry with him — that’s the meaning of ‘hate iron for not becoming steel’. If you want to find him a wife, of course that’s only right. How can I oppose you and not care for him? I am worried by his illness too; but as you wouldn’t let me see him, I haven’t ventured to say anything. May I ask what exactly is the matter with him?”\n\nLady Wang, seeing that his eyes were red, knew that he was distressed and told Xiren to help Baoyu out to see his father. At Xiren’s bidding he paid his respects, and Jia Zheng saw how emaciated he looked and the crazy expression in his lack-lustre eyes. He told them to take him back inside.\n\nReflecting, “I am nearly sixty myself and am going away to the provinces, who knows for how many years? The Emperor in his kindness has appointed me to this post, and I can beg for leave only after I’ve worked there for some time. But if anything happens to this boy, I shall have no heir in my old age. Although there is my grandson, he is not the same as having a son. Besides, the old lady dotes on Baoyu. If anything happens to him, that would be the death of her....”\n\nHe looked at Lady Wang whose face was wet with tears.\n\n“You are so advanced in years, madam, yet still worrying about your grandson,” he said to his mother, rising. “How can your son presume to oppose you? We had better do as you think best. But has this been broached to Aunt Xue?”\n\n“My sister has already given her consent,” said Lady Wang. “It is only because of Pan’s court case that we haven’t spoken of it recently.”\n\n“Yes, that’s the first difficulty,” he rejoined. “How can the girl marry when her brother is in prison? Besides, although the death of an Imperial Consort does not prevent weddings, Baoyu, having worn mourning for his elder sister for nine months, should not marry so soon. And another thing: my date of departure has been announced; I cannot delay it. What can we do in the few days before I leave?”\n\nThe Lady Dowager thought this over and agreed that these were indeed difficulties. If they waited until these matters were settled, his father would have left. And if by then Baoyu’s illness...\n\n\"Each day he grows worse. What are we to do? We'll just have to override convention.\" Having made up her mind she said, \"If you'll let me make the arrangements, I've a plan which is sure to work and won't make anyone look bad. My daughter-in-law and I will go and beg Aunt Xue's consent in person. As for Pan, I'll ask Ke to tell him that this is to save Baoyu's life, so that everything must be done simply and they're bound to agree. Of course it won't do to have a wedding during the period of mourning; and Baoyu is in no state to marry anyway. This is just to hasten the wedding to counteract his bad luck. As both families are willing and the young people have the predestined bond of gold and jade, there's no need to consult their horoscopes. We'll just choose a good day for the exchange of gifts according to our family status, then fix a date for the wedding. We'll have no drums or music, but follow the Palace custom of twelve pairs of lanterns and a sedan-chair with eight bearers. Then, according to our southern custom, they'll bow to each other and sit on the bridal bed, and that will count as the wedding.\n\n\"We've no need to worry about Baochai being understanding. And Xiren's a reliable girl who can look after him. It will be even better to have someone sensible to keep urging him to behave. He gets on well with Baochai too. Besides, Aunt Xue once said that a monk had predicted that Baochai should marry someone with jade. Who knows, when she comes here her golden locket may draw out his jade, and we can't be sure that may not happen. Then he'll get better day by day, and won't that be a blessing for the whole family? We must get the rooms ready at once and start preparing. You must assign them their apartments. We won't ask any relatives or friends, and there'll be no feast. After Baoyu's better and the mourning's over, then we can invite people to a feast. That way we'll have time for everything. You'll see the young couple married and can set your mind at rest.\"\n\nJia Zheng had to acquiesce in this because, although unwilling, he dared not oppose his mother. Forcing a smile he said, \"You've thought it all out very well, madam, very fitting. But the servants must be told not to make such a commotion about it that everyone inside and outside hears. If they do, we'll be blamed. I'm afraid Aunt Xue may not agree either. If she does, of course we can go ahead as you suggest.\"\n\n\"Leave Aunt Xue to me,\" said the Lady Dowager. \"You can go now.\"\n\nJia Zheng assented and withdrew, not at all happy about this. However, as he had many things to attend to before taking up his new post — collecting his credentials from the ministry, entertaining the friends who recommended people to him — he left the arrangements for Baoyu to the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and Xifeng. He simply assigned to Baoyu more than twenty rooms in a large compound behind the Hall of Glorious Felicity next to Lady Wang's suite, not concerning himself with anything else. When the Lady Dowager told him her decision he simply said, \"Very good.\" But this happened later.\n\nAfter Baoyu had seen his father, Xiren helped him back to his couch in the inner room. As Jia Zheng was outside, no one dared speak to Baoyu, who dozed off. He had not heard a word of the conversation between his father and grandmother. But Xiren, who had been listening quietly, had heard it all clearly. Although there had been rumours before, she had not believed them as Baochai never came over. Now that she had heard this, it was like water sinking into sand — she was convinced. And she was delighted.\n\n\"This shows that Their Ladyships have good judgement,\" she thought. \"What a perfect match! And what good fortune for me! If she comes, that will take a load off my mind. But he has only Miss Lin in his heart. Luckily he hasn't heard this. If he knew, there's no knowing what trouble there'd be.\"\n\nThis reflection made her switch from joy to dismay. \"What's to be done?\" she wondered. \"Their Ladyships don't know what is in his mind. If in their happiness they tell him, hoping to cure him, it may well have the opposite effect.\n\nIt’s still the same as before. The first time he saw Miss Lin he wanted to smash his jade; and that summer in the Garden he mistook me for her and poured out his heart to me. Then after Zijuan’s joking remark he cried as if his heart would break. If he’s told now that he’s to marry Miss Baochai and give up Miss Lin, unless he’s completely deranged it may be the death of him. Instead of curing his illness, this shock may kill him. If I don’t speak out, three people will suffer.\n\nHaving made up her mind, she waited until Jia Zheng had left. Then, telling Qiuwen to keep an eye on Baoyu, she went out and quietly asked Lady Wang to join her in the old lady’s back room. The Lady Dowager supposed that Baoyu wanted something and took no notice, simply going on with her plans for the betrothal gifts and wedding.\n\nXiren knelt down before Lady Wang and burst into tears.\n\n“What is it?” asked Lady Wang, taking her hand. “Has someone been upsetting you? Get up and tell me.”\n\n“It’s not my place to say this, but there’s no help for it!”\n\n“Take your time and tell me slowly.”\n\n“You and the old lady have decided to give Master Bao Miss Baochai: that’s a wonderful thing. But may I ask, which do you think he’s fonder of — Miss Baochai or Miss Lin?”\n\n“As they were together as children, he’s slightly fonder of Miss Lin.”\n\n“ ‘Slightly fonder’ is not the word.” Then she described Baoyu’s behaviour towards Daiyu. “You’ve seen some of this yourself, madam. But what he said that summer I’ve never dared tell anyone.”\n\nLady Wang drew Xiren towards her.\n\n“I had my suspicions, and now you’ve confirmed them. But did you hear what the master said just now? How did Baoyu take it?”\n\n“Nowadays he smiles if anyone speaks to him; otherwise he just sleeps. So he didn’t hear.”\n\n“What can we do about this?”\n\n“I’ve told you, madam, but you must tell the old lady and think of some safe plan.”\n\n“Very well. You can go back now. I won’t mention this yet with all these people here. I’ll wait for a chance to tell the old lady and we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nLady Wang went back to the Lady Dowager, who was discussing the wedding with Xifeng.\n\n“What was Xiren whispering about?” asked the old lady. “What is there to hide?”\n\nLady Wang seized this chance to tell her Baoyu’s feelings in detail. The old lady listened in silence, and Lady Wang and Xifeng said no more either.\n\nAfter some time the Lady Dowager sighed, “I didn’t see anything else wrong — just this one thing. What’s to be done?”\n\nXifeng thought hard then said, “There’s a way, but I’m not sure if you’ll agree to it, aunt.”\n\n“If you have a plan, out with it so that we can talk it over.”\n\n“It seems to me the only way is to deceive him.”\n\n“How?” the old lady asked.\n\n“Never mind whether Baoyu is rational or not, let’s all start a rumour that the master has chosen Miss Lin for him, and see how he reacts.”\n\n. If he takes no notice at all, then we needn’t have gone to all this trouble. But if he shows some sign of relenting, then we’ll have to go to a lot more trouble.’\n\n‘What will you do if he does?’ asked Lady Wang.\n\nXifeng stepped up to her and whispered in her ear. Lady Wang nodded and smiled.\n\n‘Very well then,’ she said.\n\n‘What are you two plotting?’ asked Grandmother Jia. ‘Come on, let me into the secret.’\n\nXifeng was afraid that Grandmother Jia might not understand and give the game away, so she went up to her too and whispered in her ear. At first Grandmother Jia could not quite make it out, but Xifeng whispered a little more, and finally she said with a smile:\n\n‘Very well. But I’m afraid it will be hard on Bao-chai. And what if it all comes out? What will become of Dai-yu?’\n\n‘This is only for Bao-yu’s benefit,’ said Xifeng. ‘No one is to know of it outside. Who is there to tell?’\n\nWhile they were talking, a maid came in to announce: ‘Mr Lian is back.’ Afraid that Grandmother Jia might question him, Lady Wang shot a warning glance at Xifeng, who went out to welcome Jia Lian, and with a meaningful pout of the lips accompanied him to Lady Wang’s apartment, where they both waited for her to come. She was not long. When she entered, she found Xi-feng there with eyes red and swollen from crying. Jia Lian paid his respects and gave her a full account of his mission to Ten Li Village to make arrangements for Wang Zi-teng’s funeral. He concluded:\n\n‘There is an Edict of special commendation, conferring on him the rank of a Grand Secretary, and the posthumous title of Wen Qin. The family have been instructed to take the coffin back to Nanking for burial, and the local officials along the route are to render every assistance. They set off yesterday, and the whole family is returning to the South. Aunt Wang sent me back to pay her respects and to say how disappointed she is not to be coming to the capital. There is so much she would have liked to discuss with you. She also said that she had heard that Cousin Pan was on his way to the capital, and that if we should happen to meet him on the road, we were to tell him to come here and talk things over in detail.’\n\nLady Wang was greatly saddened by this news. Xifeng did her best to console her.\n\n‘Please try to rest now, Aunt. I will come again this evening and we can discuss Bao-yu’s affairs.’\n\nShe returned to her room with Jia Lian, told him of the plan and instructed him to send servants to make the necessary preparations for the wedding. But no more of this.\n\n*\n\nOne day after breakfast, Dai-yu set off for Grandmother Jia’s with Nightingale. She wanted to pay her daily respects, but she also hoped that the excursion might take her mind off things. She had only been walking for a few minutes after leaving the Naiad’s House, when she remembered that she had forgotten her handkerchief, and sent Nightingale back to fetch it, while she herself walked on slowly to wait for her. She had just reached the rocks behind Drenched Blossoms Bridge, near the place where she had once buried flowers with Bao-yu, when she heard the sound of sobbing coming from the other side of the rocks. She stopped to listen, but could not identify the voice, or make out what exactly was being lamented so dolefully. She was most perplexed, and walked slowly forward to investigate. She came upon a maid with big eyes and thick eyebrows, who at sight of her stopped crying and rose to her feet, wiping her eyes. Dai-yu saw that it was no one she knew.\n\n‘Why are you crying so miserably, all on your own here?’ she asked.\n\nThe maid began to sob again and replied:\n\n‘Miss Lin, please tell me if I’m not right! They were talking, and I didn’t know, and I only said one wrong thing, and my sister had to go and hit me for it…’\n\nDai-yu could not understand a word of this.\n\n‘Which sister is that?’ she asked with a smile.\n\n‘Pearl,’ replied the maid.\n\nOnly then did she realize that the maid was from the Lady Dowager’s apartments. “What is your name?” she asked.\n\n“Numskull.”\n\nDaiyu smiled. “Why did your sister slap you? What was it you said wrong?”\n\n“Why? For talking about Master Bao’s marriage to Miss Bao-chai.”\n\nThese words struck Daiyu like a thunderbolt. Her heart beat wildly. It was some time before she felt calmer, and then she said, “Come with me.”\n\nShe led the maid to the corner where she had buried the peach-blossom, a secluded spot.\n\n“Why should she slap you for talking about Master Bao’s marriage to Miss Bao-chai?” she asked.\n\n“Our Old Lady and Mrs. Lian decided, because the master’s leaving, to ask Mrs. Xue to let them marry Miss Bao-chai to Master Bao straight away. To help him get over his illness, for one thing. And for another...” She broke off to giggle at Daiyu. “They want to get this wedding over quickly so that they can find a husband for Miss Lin.”\n\nDaiyu was petrified.\n\nThe girl rattled on, “I don’t know what they’re plotting, not letting people talk about it for fear Miss Bao-chai may hear and feel embarrassed. I just said to Aroma in Master Bao’s room, ‘What fun we’ll have tomorrow! How are we going to address her when Miss Bao-chai becomes Mrs. Bao?’ Tell me, Miss Lin, did that remark of mine harm Aroma in any way? Yet she came over and slapped my face, and accused me of talking nonsense and disobeying orders. She threatened to have me thrown out. But how was I to know they’d forbidden talk about it? Nobody told me, yet she hit me.” She started sobbing again.\n\nBy now Daiyu felt as if her heart were stuffed with oil, pickles, sugar and vinegar all mixed up together, so that she could not tell whether it felt sweet, bitter, sour or salty. After a pause she said tremulously:\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense. If you go on like that, people will hear and slap you again. Off you go now.” With that she turned to go back to Bamboo Lodge. But she felt as if her whole body weighed a thousand catties and her feet were treading on cotton-wool. She could hardly drag herself along, and in her distraction instead of taking a short-cut she wandered all the way round. After walking for some time she had still not reached Seeping Fragrance Bridge. She had just got there, in fact, when without thinking she turned back again along the embankment.\n\nMeanwhile Nightingale, having found the handkerchief, looked around for Daiyu but could not see her anywhere. She was wondering where she had gone when to her astonishment she saw her, pale as a ghost, reeling along with a fixed stare, turning now east, now west. A maid was walking ahead but was too far away to be recognized. Nightingale, nonplussed, hurried up to Daiyu.\n\n“Why are you turning back, miss?” she asked gently. “Where were you going?”\n\nDaiyu heard her vaguely and answered at random, “I’m going to ask Bao-yu something.”\n\nThis made no sense to Nightingale, who could only help her to the Lady Dowager’s quarters.\n\nWhen they reached the gate, Daiyu seemed more clear-headed. She turned to see who was supporting her and stared blankly at Nightingale.\n\n“What are you doing here?” she asked.\n\n“I brought your handkerchief, miss,” was the smiling reply. “I saw you at the bridge just now and came over to ask what you wanted, but you didn’t answer.”\n\n“I thought you’d come to see Bao-yu,” said Daiyu with a smile. “Otherwise, why should you be coming this way?”\n\nRealizing that she was confused, Nightingale knew she must have heard something.\n\nHearing this, Zijuan could only smile and nod without venturing a reply. She was afraid that if Daiyu saw Baoyu — the one crazy, the other deranged — they might both blurt out wild talk which it would be highly improper for others to hear. What could she do? However, she dared not oppose Daiyu and had to help her inside.\n\nTo her surprise, Daiyu was not as limp as before. Instead of waiting for Zijuan to raise the portiere she lifted it herself and went in. It was very quiet inside because the Lady Dowager was taking a nap and some of the maids had seized this chance to relax or doze off, while those on duty were waiting on her in silence. Hearing the portiere swish, Xiren came out and, at sight of Daiyu, invited her to take a seat.\n\n“Is Master Bao at home?” Daiyu asked with a smile.\n\nNot knowing what was afoot, Xiren was about to answer when she saw Zijuan signalling to her behind Daiyu’s back, pointing at Daiyu and shaking her hand. Not understanding this, Xiren said nothing. Daiyu, not noticing this, went on into the room. There was Baoyu, sitting there. Instead of standing up to greet her he simply stared at her with a foolish grin. Daiyu sat down then and stared back at him with a smile. Neither said a word or offered any greeting; they just kept on smiling vacantly at each other. This sight nonplussed Xiren, who could think of no way to cope. Then suddenly Daiyu asked:\n\n“Why are you ill?”\n\n“For Cousin Lin’s sake,” he answered with a grin.\n\nXiren and Zijuan turned pale with dismay and tried to change the subject; but the other two simply smiled foolishly without answering. Realizing that Daiyu was now as deranged as Baoyu, Xiren whispered to Zijuan:\n\n“Your young lady’s just come to. I’ll ask Qiuwen to help you take her back to rest.” She turned to tell Qiuwen, “Go with Sister Zijuan to see Miss Lin home. Mind you don’t talk nonsense.”\n\nQiuwen smiled and said nothing, then went to help Zijuan support Daiyu, who stood up and stared at Baoyu with a smile, nodding her head. Zijuan urged her, “Do go home and rest, miss.”\n\n“Of course,” said Daiyu. “It’s time I went back.” She turned and walked out, still smiling, refusing the maids’ help and walking much faster than usual. Zijuan and Qiuwen hurried after her.\n\nOnce out of the Lady Dowager’s compound, Daiyu strode straight ahead until Zijuan took her arm, exclaiming, “This way, miss!” Still smiling, she let herself be led to Bamboo Lodge. When they were nearly there, Zijuan cried, “Amida Buddha! Now we’re home!”\n\nBut hardly were the words out of her mouth when Daiyu stumbled forward and vomited a mouthful of blood.\n\nTo know whether she lived or died, read the next chapter."
