  "original": "话说香菱见众人正说笑他，便迎上去笑道：“你们看这首诗，要使得，我就还学，要还不好，我就死了这做诗的心了。”说着，把诗递与黛玉及众人看时，只见写道是：\n　　精华掩掩料应难，影自娟娟魄自寒。\n　　一片砧敲千里白，半轮鸡唱五更残。\n　　绿蓑江上秋闻笛，红袖楼头夜倚栏。\n　　博得嫦娥应自问，何缘不使永团圆？\n　　众人看了，笑道：“这首不但好，而且新巧有意趣。可知俗语说：‘天下无难事，只怕有心人。’社里一定请你了！”香菱听了，心下不信，料着是他们哄自己的话，还只管问黛玉、宝钗等。\n　　正说之间，只见几个小丫头并老婆子忙忙的走来，都笑道：“来了好些姑娘奶奶们，我们都不认得，奶奶姑娘们快认亲去。”李纨笑道：“这是那里的话？你到底说明白了，是谁的亲戚？”那婆子丫头都笑道：“奶奶的两位妹子都来了；还有一位姑娘，说是薛大姑娘的妹子，还有一位爷，说是薛大爷的兄弟。我这会子请姨太太去呢，奶奶和姑娘们先上去罢。”说着，一径去了。宝钗笑道：“我们薛蝌和他妹子来了不成？”李纨笑道：“或者我婶娘又上京来了？怎么他们都凑在一处？这可是奇事。”\n　　大家来至王夫人上房，只见黑压压的一地。又有邢夫人的嫂子，带了女儿岫烟进京来投邢夫人的，可巧凤姐之兄王仁也正进京，两亲家一处搭帮来了。走至半路泊船时，遇见李纨寡婶，带着两个女儿，长名李纹，次名李绮，也上京，大家叙起来，又是亲戚，因此三家一路同行。后有薛蟠之从弟薛蝌，因当年父亲在京时，已将胞妹薛宝琴许配都中梅翰林之子为妻，正欲进京聘嫁，闻得王仁进京，他也随后带了妹子赶来。所以今日会齐了，来访投各人亲戚。于是大家见礼叙过，贾母、王夫人都欢喜非常。贾母因笑道：“怪道昨日晚灯花爆了又爆，结了又结，原来应到今日。”一面叙些家常，收了带来的礼物，一面命留酒饭。凤姐儿自不必说，忙上加忙。李纨、宝钗自然和婶母、妹妹叙离别之情。黛玉见了，先是欢喜，后想起众人皆有亲眷，独自己孤单无倚，不免又去垂泪。宝玉深知其情，十分劝慰了一番方罢。\n　　然后宝玉忙忙来至怡红院中，向袭人、麝月、晴雯笑道：“你们还不快着看去！谁知宝姐姐的亲哥哥是那个样子，他这叔伯兄弟，形容举止另是个样子，倒象是宝姐姐的同胞兄弟似的。更奇在你们成日家只说宝姐姐是绝色的人物，你们如今瞧见他这妹子，还有大嫂子的两个妹子，我竟形容不出来了。老天，老天，你有多少精华灵秀，生出这些人上之人来？可知我‘并底之蛙’，成日家只说现在的这几个人是有一无二的，谁知不必远寻，就是本地风光，一个赛似一个。如今我又长了一层学问了。除了这几个，难道还有几个不成？”一面说，一面自笑。袭人见他又有些魔意，便不肯去瞧。晴雯等早去瞧了一遍回来，带笑向袭人说道：“你快瞧瞧去，大太太一个侄女儿，宝姑娘一个妹妹，大奶奶两个妹妹，倒象一把子四根水葱儿。”\n　　一语未了，只见探春也笑着进来找宝玉，因说：“咱们诗社可兴旺了。”宝玉笑道：“正是呢。这是一高兴起诗社，鬼使神差来了这些人。但只一件，不知他们可学过做诗不曾？”探春道：“我才都问了问，虽是他们自谦，看其光景，没有不会的。便是不会也没难处，你看香菱就知道了。”晴雯笑道：“他们里头薛大姑娘的妹妹更好。三姑娘看着怎么样？”探春道：“果然的。”据我看来，连他姐姐并这些人总不及他。”袭人听了，又是诧异，又是笑道：“这也奇了，还从那里再寻好的去呢？我倒要瞧瞧去。”探春道：“老太太一见了，喜欢的无可不可的，已经逼着咱们太太认了干女孩儿了。老太太要养活，才刚已经定了。”宝玉喜的忙问：“这话果然么？”探春道：“我几时撒过谎？”又笑道：“老太大有了这个好孙女儿，就忘了你这孙子了。”宝玉笑道：“这倒不妨，原该多疼女孩儿些是正理。明儿十六，咱们可该起社了。”探春道：“林丫头刚起来了，二姐姐又病了，终是七上八下的。”宝玉道：“二姐姐又不大做诗，没有他又何妨。”探春道：“索性等几天，等他们新来的混熟了，咱们邀上他们岂不好？这会子大嫂子、宝姐姐心里自然没有诗兴的。况且湘云没来，颦儿才好了，人都不合式。不如等着云丫头来了，这几个新的也熟了，颦儿也大好了，大嫂子和宝姐姐心也闲了，香菱诗也长进了，如此邀一满社，岂不好？咱们两个如今且往老太太那里去听听，除宝姐姐的妹妹不算外，他一定是在咱们家住定了的。倘或那三个要不在咱们这里住，咱们央告着老太太，留下他们也在园子里住了，咱们岂不多添几个，越发有趣了。”\n　　宝玉听了，喜的眉开眼笑，忙说道：“倒是你明白。我终久是个糊涂心肠，空喜欢了一会子，却想不到这上头。”说着，兄妹两个一齐往贾母处来。果然王夫人已认了薛宝琴做干女儿。贾母喜欢非常，不命往园中住，晚上跟着贾母一处安寝。薛蝌自向薛蟠书房中住下了。贾母和邢夫人说：“你侄女儿也不必家去了，园里住几天，逛逛再去。”邢夫人兄嫂家中原艰难，这一上京原仗的是邢夫人与他们治房舍帮盘缠，听如此说，岂不愿意。邢夫人便将邢岫烟交与凤姐儿。凤姐儿算着园中妹妹多，性情不一，且又不便另设一处，莫若送到迎春一处去，倘日后邢岫烟有些不遂意的事，纵然邢夫人知道了，与自己无干。从此后，若邢岫烟家去住的日期不算，若在大观园住到一个月上，凤姐儿亦照迎春分例，送一分与岫烟。凤姐儿冷眼岫烟心性行为，竟不象邢夫人及他的父母一样，却是个极温厚可疼的人。因此凤姐儿反怜他家贫命苦，比别的妹妹多疼他些，邢夫人倒不大理论了。贾母、王夫人等因素喜李纨贤惠，且年轻守节，令人敬服，今见他寡婶来了，便不肯叫他外头去住。那婶母虽十分不肯，无奈贾母执意不从，只得带着李纹、李绮在稻香村住下了。\n　　当下安插既定，谁知忠靖侯史鼎又迁委了外省大员，不日要带家眷去上任，贾母因舍不得湘云，便留下他了，接到家中。原要命凤姐儿另设一处与他住，史湘云执意不肯，只要和宝钗一处住，因此也就罢了。\n　　此时大观园中、比先又热闹了多少，李纨为首，徐者迎春、探春、惜春、宝钗、黛玉、湘云、李纹、李绮、宝琴、邢岫烟，再添上凤姐儿和宝玉，一共十三人。叙起年庚，除李纨年纪最长，凤姐次之，馀者皆不过十五六七岁，大半同年异月，连他们自己也不能记清谁长谁幼，并贾母、王夫人及家中婆子丫头也不能细细分清，不过是“姐”“妹”“兄”“弟”四个字，随便乱叫。\n　　如今香菱正满心满意只想做诗，又不敢十分罗唆宝钗，可巧来了个史湘云，那史湘云极爱说话的，那里禁得香菱又请教他谈诗？越发高了兴，没昼没夜，高谈阔论起来。宝钗因笑道：“我实在聒噪的受不得了。一个女孩儿家，只管拿着诗做正经事讲起来，叫有学问的人听了反笑话，说不守本分。一个香菱没闹清，又添上你这个话一袋子，满口里说的是什么：怎么是‘杜工部之沉郁，韦苏州之淡雅’，又怎么是‘温八叉之绮靡，李义山之隐僻’。痴痴癫癫，那里还象两个女儿家呢。”说得香菱湘云二人都笑起来。\n　　正说着，只见宝琴来了，披着一领斗篷，金翠辉煌，不知何物。宝钗忙问：“这是那里的？”宝琴笑道：“因下雪珠儿，老太太找了这一件给我的。”香菱上来瞧道：“怪道这么好看，原来是孔雀毛织的。”湘云笑道：“那里是孔雀毛？就是野鸭子头上的毛做的。可见老太太疼你了，这么着疼宝玉，也没给他穿。”宝钗笑道：“真是俗语说的，‘各人有各人的缘法’。我也想不到他这会子来，既来了，又有老太太这么疼他。”湘云道：“你除了在老太太跟前，就在园里，来这两处，只管玩笑吃喝。到了太太屋里，若太太在屋里，只管和太太说笑，多坐一回无妨，若太太不在屋里，你别进去。那屋里人多心坏，都是耍咱们的。”说的宝钗、宝琴、香菱、莺儿等都笑了。宝钗笑道：“说你没心却有心，虽然有心，到底嘴太直了。我们这琴儿，今儿你竟认他做亲妹妹罢。”湘云又瞅了宝琴笑道：“这一件衣裳也只配他穿，别人穿了实在不配。”正说着，只见琥珀走来，笑道：“老太太说了，叫宝姑娘别管紧了琴姑娘，他还小呢，让他爱怎么着就由他怎么着，他要什么东西只管要，别多心。”宝钗忙起身答应了，又推宝琴笑道：“你也不知是那里来的这点福气。你倒去罢，恐怕我们委屈了你！我就不信，我那些儿不如你？”\n　　说话之间，宝玉、黛玉进来了，宝钗犹自嘲笑。湘云因笑道：“宝姐姐，你这话虽是玩，却有人真心是这样想呢。”琥珀笑道：“真心恼的再没别人，就只是他。”口里说，手抬着宝玉。宝钗、湘云都笑道：“他倒不是这样人。”琥珀又笑道：“不是他，就是他。”说着，又指黛玉。湘云便不作声。宝钗笑道：“更不是了。我的妹妹和他的妹妹一样，他喜欢的比我还甚呢，他那里还恼？你信云儿混说，他那嘴有什么正经。”宝玉素昔深知黛玉有些小性儿，尚不知近日黛玉和宝钗之事，正恐贾母疼宝琴，他心中不自在。今儿湘云如此说了，宝钗又如此答，再审度黛玉声色亦不似往日，果然与宝钗之说相符，心中甚是不解。因想：“他两个素日不是这样的，如今看来，竟更比他人好了十倍。”一时又见林黛玉赶着宝琴叫“妹妹”，并不提名道姓，真似亲妹妹一般。那宝琴年轻心热，且本性聪敏，自幼读书识字，今在贾府住了两日，大概人物巳知：又见众妹妹都不是那轻薄脂粉，且又和姐姐皆和气，故也不肯怠慢。其中又见林黛玉是个出类拔萃的，便更与黛玉亲敬异常。宝玉看着，只是暗暗的纳罕。\n　　一时宝钗姊妹往薛姨妈房内去后，湘云往贾母处来，林黛玉回房歇着。宝玉便找了黛玉来，笑道：“我虽看了《西厢记》，也曾有明白的几句说了取笑，你还曾恼过。如今想来，竟有一句不解，我念出来，你讲讲我听。”黛玉听了，便知有文章，因笑道：“你念出来我听听。”宝玉笑道：“那《闹简》上有一句说的最好：‘是几时孟光接了梁鸿案？’这五个字不过是现成的典，难为他‘是几时’三个虚字，问的有趣。是几时接了？你说说我听听。”黛玉听了，禁不住也笑起来，因笑道：“这原问的好。他也问的好，你也问的好。”宝玉道：“先时你只疑我，如今你也没的说了。”黛玉笑道：“谁知他竟真是个好人，我素日只当他藏奸。”因把说错了酒令，宝钗怎样说他，连送燕窝，病中所谈之事，细细的告诉宝玉，宝玉方知原故。因笑道：“我说呢，正纳闷‘是几时孟光接了梁鸿案’，原来是从‘小孩儿家口没遮拦’上就接了案了。”\n　　黛玉因又说起宝琴来，想起自己没有姊妹，不免又哭了。宝玉忙劝道：“这又自寻烦恼了。你瞧瞧，今年比旧年越发瘦了，你还不保养。每天好好的，你必是自寻烦恼，哭一会子，才算完了这一天的事。”黛玉拭泪道：“近来我只觉心酸，眼泪却象比旧年少了些的。心里只管酸痛，眼泪却不多。”宝玉道：“这是你哭惯了，心里疑惑，岂有眼泪会少的！”\n　　正说着，只见他屋里的小丫头子送了猩猩毡斗篷来，又说：“大奶奶才打发人来说，下了雪，要商议明日请人做诗呢。”一语未了，只见李纨的丫头走来请黛玉。宝玉便邀着黛玉同往稻香村来。黛玉换上掐金挖云红香羊皮小靴，罩了一件大红羽笺面白狐狸皮的鹤氅，系一条青金闪绿双环四合如意绦，上罩了雪帽。二人一齐踏雪行来，只见众妹妹都在那里，都是一色大红猩猩毡与羽毛缎斗篷，独李纨穿一件哆罗呢对襟褂子，薛宝钗穿一件莲青斗纹锦上添花洋线番丝的鹤氅。邢岫烟仍是家常旧衣，并没避雨之衣。一时湘云来了，穿着贾母给他的一件貂鼠脑袋面子、大毛黑灰鼠里子、里外发烧大褂子，头上带着一顶挖云鹅黄片金里子大红猩猩毡昭君套，又围着大貂鼠风领。黛玉先笑道：“你们瞧瞧，孙行者来了。他一般的拿着雪褂子，故意妆出个小骚鞑子样儿来。”湘云笑道：“你们瞧我里头打扮的。”一面说，一面脱了褂子，只见他里头穿着一件半新的靠色三厢领袖秋香色盘金五色绣龙窄小袖掩衿银鼠短袄，里面短短的一件水红妆缎狐肷摺子，腰里紧紧束着一条蝴蝶结子长穗五色宫绦，脚下也穿着鹿皮小靴，越显得蜂腰猿背，鹤势螂形。众人笑道：“偏他只爱打扮成个小子的样儿，原比他打扮女儿更俏丽了些。”\n　　湘云笑道：“快商议做诗。我听听是谁的东家？”李纨道：“我的主意。想来昨儿的正日已自过了。再等正日还早呢，可巧又下雪，不如咱们大家凑个热闹，又给他们接风，又可以做诗。你们意思怎么样？”宝玉先道：“这话很是，只是今儿晚了，若到明儿，晴了又无趣。”众人都道：“这雪未必晴。纵晴了，这一夜下的也够赏了。”李纨道：“我这里虽然好，又不如芦雪庭好。我已经打发人笼地炕去了，咱们大家拥炉做诗。老太太想来未必高兴。况且咱们小玩意儿，单给凤丫头个信儿就是了。你们每人一两银子就够了，送到我这里来。”指着香菱、宝琴、李纹、李绮、岫烟，“五个不算外，咱们里头二丫头病了不算，四丫头告了假也不算，你们四分子送了来，我包管五六两银子也尽够了。”宝钗等一齐应诺。因又拟题限韵，李纨笑道：“我心里早已定了。等到了明日临期，横竖知道。”说毕，大家又说了一回闲话，方往贾母处来，当日无话。\n　　到了次日清早，宝玉因心里惦记者，这一夜没好生得睡，天亮了就爬起来。掀起帐子一看，虽然门窗尚掩，只是窗上光辉夺目，心内早踌躇起来，埋怨定是晴了，日光已出。一面忙起来揭起窗屉，从玻璃窗内往外一看，原来不是日光，竟是一夜的雪，下的将有一尺厚，天上仍是搓绵扯絮一般。宝玉此时喜欢非常，忙唤起人来，盥漱已毕，只穿一件茄色哆罗呢狐狸皮袄，罩一件海龙小鹰膀褂子，束了腰；披上玉针蓑，带了金藤笠，登上沙棠屐，忙忙的往芦雪庭来。出了院门，四顾一望，并无二色，远远的是青松翠竹，自己却似装在玻璃盆内一般。于是走至山坡之下。顺着山脚刚转过去，已闻得一股寒香扑鼻，回头一看，却是妙玉那边栊翠庵中有十数枝红梅如胭脂一般，映着雪色，分外显得精神，好不有趣。宝玉便立住，细细的赏玩了一回方走。只见蜂腰板桥上一个人打着伞走来，是李纨打发了请凤姐儿去的人。宝玉来至芦雪庭，只见丫头婆子正在那里扫雪开径。原来这芦雪庭盖在一个傍山临水河滩之上，一带几间茅檐土壁，横篱竹牖，推窗便可垂钓，四面皆是芦苇掩覆。一条去径，逶迤穿芦度苇过去，便是藕香榭的竹桥了。众丫头婆子见他披蓑带笠而来，都笑道：“我们才说，正少一个渔翁，如今果然全了。姑娘们吃了饭才来呢，你也太性急了。”宝玉听了，只得回来。刚至沁芳亭，见探春正从秋爽斋出来，围着大红猩猩毡的斗篷，带着观音兜，扶着个小丫头，后面一个妇人打着一把青绸油伞。宝玉知道他往贾母处去，遂站在亭边等他来到，二人一同出园前去。\n　　宝琴正在里间房内梳洗更衣。一时众姐妹来齐，宝玉只嚷饿了，连连催饭。好容易等摆上饭来，头一样菜是牛乳蒸羊羔，贾母就说：“这是我们有年纪人的药，没见天日的东西，可惜你们小孩子吃不得。今儿另外有新鲜鹿肉，你们等着吃罢。”众人答应了。宝玉却等不得，只拿茶泡了一碗饭，就着野鸡瓜子忙忙的爬拉完了。贾母道：“我知道你们今儿又有事情，连饭也不顾吃了。”就叫：“留着鹿肉给他晚上吃罢。”凤姐儿忙说：“还有呢，吃残了的倒罢了。”湘云就和宝玉计较道：“有新鹿肉，不如咱们要一块，自己拿了园里弄着，又吃又玩。”宝玉听了，真和凤姐要了一块，命婆子送进园去。\n　　一时大家散后，进园齐往芦雪庭来，听李纨出题限韵。独不见湘云、宝玉二人。黛玉道：“他两个人再到不得一处，要到了一处，生出多少事来。这会子一定算计那块鹿肉去了。”正说着，只见李婶娘也走来看热闹，因问李纨道：“怎么那一个带玉的哥儿和那一个挂金麒麟的姐儿那样干净清秀，又不少吃的，他两个在那里商议看要吃生肉呢，说的有来有去的。我只不信，肉也生吃得的？”众人听了，都笑道：“了不得，快拿了他两个来。”黛玉笑道：“这可是云丫头闹的。我的卦再不错。”李纨即忙出来，找着他两个，说道：“你们两个要吃生的，我送你们到老太太那里吃去，那怕一只生鹿，撑病了不与我相干。这么大雪，怪冷的，快替我做诗去罢。”宝玉忙笑道：“没有的事！我们烧着吃呢。”李纨道：“这还罢了。”只见老婆子们拿了铁炉、铁叉、铁丝蒙来，李纨道：“留神，割了手不许哭。”说着，方进去了。\n　　那边凤姐打发平儿回复不来，为发放年例正忙着呢。湘云见了平儿，那里肯放？平儿也是个好玩的，素日跟着凤姐儿无所不至，见如此有趣，乐得玩笑，因而退去手上的镯子，三个人围着火，平儿便要先烧三块吃。那边宝钗、黛玉平素看惯了，不以为异，宝琴及李婶娘深为罕事。探春和李纨等已议定了题韵。探春笑道：“你们闻闻，香气这里都闻见了，我也吃去。”说着，也找了他们来。李纨也随来，说：“客已齐了，你们还吃不够吗？”湘云一面吃，一面说道：“我吃这个方爱吃酒，吃了酒才有诗。若不是这鹿肉，今儿断不能做诗。”说着，只见宝琴披着凫靥裘，站在那里笑。湘云笑道：“傻子！你来尝尝。”宝琴笑道：“怪腌的。”宝钗笑道：“你尝尝去，好吃的很呢。你林姐姐弱，吃了不消化，不然他也爱吃。”宝琴听了，就过去吃了一块，果然好吃，就也吃起来。一时凤姐儿打发小丫头来叫平儿，平儿说：“史姑娘拉着我呢，你先去罢。”小丫头去了。一时，只见凤姐儿也披了斗篷走来，笑道：“吃这样好东西，也不告诉我！”说着，也凑在一处吃起来。黛玉笑道：“那里找这一群花子去！罢了罢了，今日芦雪庭遭劫，生生被云丫头作践了。我为芦雪庭一大哭。”湘云冷笑道：“你知道什么，‘是真名士自风流’。你们都是假清高，最可厌的。我们这会子腥的膻的大吃大嚼，回来却是锦心绣口。”宝钗笑道：“你回来若做的不好了，把那肉掏出来，就把这雪压的芦苇子摁上些，以完此劫。”说着，吃毕，洗了一回手。平儿带镯子时，却少了一个，左右前后乱找了一番，踪迹全无。众人都诧异。凤姐儿笑道：“我知道这镯子的去向，你们只管做诗去。我们也不用找，只管前头去，不出三日包管就有了。”说着又问：“你们今儿做什么诗？老太太说了，离年又近了，正月里还该做些灯谜儿大家玩笑。”众人听了，都笑道：“可是呢，倒忘了。如今赶着做几个好的，预备着正月里玩。”说着一齐来至地炕屋内，只见杯盘里菜俱已摆齐了，墙上巳贴出诗题、韵脚、格式来了。宝玉、湘云二人忙看时，只见题目是《即景联句》，“五言排律一首，限‘二萧’韵。”后面尚未列次序。李纨道：“我不大会做诗，我只起三句罢，然后谁先得了谁先联。”宝钗道：“到底分个次序。”\n要知端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "Just then Xiangling joined the group who had been amusing themselves at her expense.\n\n“If you think this poem any good I’ll go on studying,” she said with a smile. “If not, I’ll give up. Here it is.”\n\nShe handed the poem to Daiyu and the others, and they read:\n\nHard for a pure essence to conceal its light:\nShadow so lovely, spirit certain to freeze.\nA slab pounds clothes, miles and miles of moonlit night;\nA cock crows, dawn breaks on the last watch of moon.\nBy green-rush bank the flute’s heard in autumn;\nA girl leans over red-railed balcony at night.\nIt must make the goddess in the moon exclaim:\nWhy can those separated ne’er be reunited?\n\n“Not just good, but original and ingenious too!” they cried. “This proves the old saying that all difficulties on earth can be overcome if men but give their minds to them. We must certainly ask you to join our club.”\n\nXiangling, thinking they must be making fun of her, turned to question Daiyu and Baochai.\n\nJust then some maids and old nurses hurried in beaming.\n\n“Some young ladies and other relatives have just arrived,” they announced. “We don’t know who they are, but you’d better go and welcome them, madam, young ladies.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” asked Li Wan. “Out with it! Whose relatives are they?”\n\n“There are two of your cousins, madam, and a young lady who’s Cousin Baochai’s younger sister, and a young gentleman who’s her cousin. We’re on our way to ask Aunt Xue over. Will you go on ahead, madam and young ladies?”\n\nWith that they went off.\n\n“Can it be Xue Ke and my sister have come?” wondered Baochai.\n\n“Maybe my aunt has come to the capital again,” said Li Wan. “But how is it they’ve all turned up together? This is very strange.”\n\nThey went to Lady Wang’s main reception room, which was packed with people. Among the new arrivals they learned was the wife of Lady Xing’s brother, who had brought her daughter Xiuyan to the capital to stay with Lady Xing. By chance, on the way, they had fallen in with Wang Ren, Xifeng’s elder brother, who was also bound for the capital; and since these two families were related they had travelled together. Half way there, when their boat put in, they had met Li Wan’s widowed aunt who was taking her two daughters Li Wen and Li Qi to the capital. And as they were related too, the three families had travelled on together. Then Xue Ke, Xue Pan’s cousin, whose father had betrothed his daughter Baoqin to the son of an Hanlin scholar in the capital before his death, had set out to bring her here for the wedding. Hearing that Wang Ren was on his way to the capital, he had hurried after him with his sister and joined the party. So now they had all come together to call on their different relatives.\n\nAfter an exchange of greetings, the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang were overjoyed.\n\n“No wonder my lamp kept spluttering last night,” said the old lady. “So that was an omen of your arrival.”\n\nThey chatted about domestic affairs and accepted the gifts brought them, then ordered a meal for the visitors. Xifeng, needless to say, had more than ever to attend to, while Li Wan and Baochai naturally chatted with their aunts and cousins.\n\nDaiyu, after her first delight, reflected that all the others had relatives but she had none. She could not hold back her tears.\n\nBaoyu, well aware of the reason, did his best to comfort her.\n\nPresently he hurried back to Happy Red Court and said to Xiren, Sheyue and Qingwen, “Hurry up and go to see the new arrivals. Cousin Baochai’s younger cousin is quite a different proposition from her elder brother — you’d take him for her own brother. And what’s even more amazing, you’re always saying what a beauty Cousin Baochai is, but just wait till you see her cousin and Cousin Zhu’s two sisters. Heavens! Why should nature produce so many exquisite creatures? This shows what a frog I am, cooped up at the bottom of a well, with no notion of what the rest of the world is like.”\n\n\"These few people here are unique, I thought. Who could have imagined that, without searching far afield, right here in our own household there are so many girls each lovelier than the last? Now I realize how little I know. Are there still more of them?\" As he spoke he smiled to himself.\n\nSince Xiren saw that he was in one of his crazy moods again, she was not going to look. But Qingwen and the others, who had already been over to see the newcomers, came back and told Xiren with a smile, \"Do go and have a look. Madame Wang's niece, Miss Baochai's cousin and Madam Zhu's two sisters are like four fresh young scallions.\"\n\nJust then Tanchun came in laughing to look for Baoyu.\n\n\"Our poetry club is going to flourish,\" she announced.\n\n\"Yes, this is great!\" he cried. \"It's an inspiration to start the club, and these people have turned up as if whisked here by magic. But I wonder if they know how to write poetry?\"\n\n\"I've just asked them. They were very modest, but I've an idea they do. Even if they don't, that wouldn't matter. Look how fast Xiangling's learning.\"\n\n\"Of them all, Miss Baochai's cousin is the prettiest,\" put in Qingwen. \"What do you think, miss?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tanchun. \"I think she's even prettier than her sister and all the rest of them.\"\n\nXiren, amazed and smiling, exclaimed, \"That's really strange! Where would you find anyone better? I must have a look.\"\n\n\"The old lady was so delighted with her at first sight,\" Tanchun told them, \"that she's already made Lady Wang adopt her as her daughter. She wants to bring her up herself and it's all settled.\"\n\n\"Is that true?\" cried Baoyu gleefully.\n\n\"When did you ever know me tell a lie?\" retorted Tanchun. \"The old lady has such a nice granddaughter now, she may forget all about you.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. It's only right that girls should come first. Tomorrow's the sixteenth, so we can start our club.\"\n\n\"Cousin Lin's just got up and Second Sister's ill again,\" said Tanchun. \"Things are still at sixes and sevens.\"\n\n\"Second Sister doesn't write much poetry anyway, so it won't matter if she's not in.\"\n\n\"Why not wait a few days till the newcomers have settled in, then we can ask them to join? That would be better, wouldn't it? Just now Madam Zhu and Cousin Baochai are in no mood for poetry. Besides, Xiangyun isn't back and Pinger's only just better, so the time isn't suitable. Let's wait till Xiangyun's here, these newcomers know their way around, Pinger's completely recovered, Madam Zhu and Baochai have more time, and Xiangling's improved at versifying; then we can invite all the members. Wouldn't that be better? Now let's go to the old lady's to hear what's been decided. Apart from Baochai's cousin, who's sure to stay with us, if the other three aren't going to live here we must ask the old lady to keep them in the Garden. Then we'll have more people, and that will be more fun still.\"\n\nBaoyu beamed with delight at this.\n\n\"How sensible you are!\" he cried. \"I'm so stupid, it never entered my head though I was so pleased. I just didn't think of that.\"\n\nSo brother and sister went together to the Lady Dowager's apartments. And sure enough, Lady Wang had already accepted Baoqin as her daughter. The old lady was so delighted that she made the girl sleep in her place instead of going to the Garden.\n\nXue Ke had moved into Xue Pan's study. The Lady Dowager told Lady Xing, \"Your niece needn't go home now. Let her stay in the Garden for a couple of days to have some fun first.\"\n\nLady Xing's brother and sister-in-law were hard up. It was Lady Xing who had found them lodgings and paid their travelling expenses to the capital, so of course they were only too glad to agree to this. She handed over Xiuyan to the Lady Dowager.\n\nNow Xifeng reflected that there were many girls in the Garden, all with different temperaments; and as it would be inconvenient to assign Xing Xiuyan separate quarters, it would be best to send her to stay with Yingchun. Then if later the girl had any complaints, Lady Xing could not hold her, Xifeng, responsible. She decided that from now on, when Xiuyan was not at home, if she spent a month or more in Grand View Garden she would give her the same allowance as Yingchun. Xifeng had observed that Xiuyan’s character and behaviour were very different from those of Lady Xing and her parents, for she was a sweet, gentle girl whom anybody would love. So Xifeng, pitying her for her poverty and hard life, was kinder to her than to the other girls. Lady Xing, however, did not care in the least.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and Lady Wang so admired Li Wan for her virtue and chastity at such a tender age that they would not allow her widowed aunt to stay outside. And though the aunt was reluctant to impose on them, the old lady insisted. So she had to move into Rice Fragrance Cottage with Li Wen and Li Qi.\n\nJust when these arrangements had been made, Shi Ding, Marquis of Zhongjing, was promoted to a provincial post and had to leave in a few days to take it up, taking his family with him. But the Lady Dowager was so attached to Xiangyun that she kept her behind and had her fetched to the Rong Mansion. She wanted Xifeng to give her separate quarters, but Xiangyun was so set on staying with Baochai that this idea was dropped.\n\nNow the Garden was more lively than ever. With Li Wan at their head, the girls — Yingchun, Tanchun, Xichun, Baochai, Daiyu, Xiangyun, Li Wen, Li Qi, Baoqin and Xing Xiuyan — now numbered eleven. And if Xifeng and Baoyu were added, that made thirteen. In order of age, Li Wan was the oldest, then Xifeng, and all the others were only fifteen or sixteen, most of them born in the same year but in different months. Even they themselves could not remember their exact order of seniority, and the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and their servants could not distinguish between them either, so they just called them “sister” or “cousin” at random.\n\nNow Xiangling was so eager to learn to write poetry that she hardly dared pester Baochai too much. Luckily Xiangyun was now staying with them, and as she was a non-stop talker what could she do but discuss poetry with Xiangling? This so delighted her that she held forth on the subject day and night.\n\n“I really can’t stand such a noise,” protested Baochai. “Now two girls here are so carried away by this mania for poetry that they talk about it all the time, not like well-bred young ladies at all. If scholars hear you, they’ll laugh and say you’ve forgotten your proper sphere. Here’s Xiangling not yet cured of her madness, and now we’ve got a chatter-box like you to keep her company. It’s all: How does Du Fu achieve his melancholy? How does Wei Yingwu achieve his limpidity? How does Wen Tingyun achieve his gorgeousness? How does Li Shangyin achieve his obscurity? You’ve both gone completely crazy.” At that, Xiangling and Xiangyun could not help laughing.\n\nJust then Baoqin arrived in a brilliant golden rain-cape.\n\n“Where did you get that?” asked Baochai.\n\n“It was snowing,” Baoqin told her. “The old lady gave me this.”\n\nXiangling stepped forward to examine it. “No wonder it looks so pretty. It’s made of peacock feathers.”\n\n“Not peacock feathers, but wild duck’s head-down,” Xiangyun corrected her. “You can see how much the old lady has taken to you, to give you this. She dotes on Baoyu, but she didn’t give it to him.”\n\n“As the saying goes, ‘Everyone has his share of luck,’” observed Baochai. “I never expected her to turn up like this; but now that she has, the old lady’s taken such a fancy to her.”\n\nXiangyun advised Baoqin, “When you’re not with the old lady, just enjoy yourself in the Garden, eating and playing. You can go and amuse yourself in her apartments too if she’s at home. But if she’s out, don’t go in — those other people there are all ones to steer clear of.”\n\n\"What nonsense! Sit down a while longer, there's no hurry. If Her Ladyship isn't in, you'd better not go in. All those people there are so nasty and deceitful, they like to make fools of us.\"\n\nThis set Bacchai, Baoqin, Xiangling and Yinger laughing.\n\n\"You sound so artless, yet you're quite artful,\" teased Bacchai. \"But though artful, you're too outspoken. As for our little Qin here, you'd better take her for your own cousin.\"\n\nXiangyun eyed Baoqin and chuckled.\n\n\"This dress looks well only on her. It doesn't suit anyone else.\"\n\nJust then Hupo came in.\n\n\"The Old Lady says, Miss Bacchai isn't to be too strict with Miss Baoqin,\" she announced. \"She's still young and should be allowed to have her own way. If she wants anything, she's to ask for it and not feel any hesitation.\"\n\nBacchai rising to her feet acquiesced, then nudged Baoqin.\n\n\"I can't think where such good fortune comes to you,\" she teased. \"Be off with you now, for fear we should wrong you. I refuse to believe I'm in any way your inferior.\"\n\nAs they were chatting, Baoyu and Daiyu arrived. Bacchai was still making fun of Baoqin.\n\n\"Cousin Bacchai, you may be joking,\" said Xiangyun, \"but some people really think that way.\"\n\n\"The one who's really annoyed is no one else but...\" Hupo pointed at Baoyu.\n\nBacchai and Xiangyun laughed.\n\n\"Oh, he's not like that.\"\n\n\"If not him, then her.\" Hupo pointed at Daiyu.\n\nXiangyun said nothing.\n\n\"Still less,\" cried Bacchai. \"My cousin's the same as his. He's even fonder of her than I am, so how can he be annoyed? Don't believe that crazy Yun's nonsense. She never talks seriously.\"\n\nBaoyu who knew that Daiyu was rather prone to take offence, but was not aware of her recent rapprochement with Bacchai, had been afraid that the Lady Dowager's favour to Baoqin might have upset her. Xiangyun's remark and Bacchai's answer, as well as Daiyu's unusually cheerful expression, confirmed Bacchai's claim and puzzled him.\n\n\"Those two used not to be on such good terms,\" he reflected. \"But now they seem ten times friendlier than ever.\"\n\nHe noticed too that Daiyu kept addressing Baoqin as \"cousin\" without using her name, as if she were her own sister. As for Baoqin, she was young and warm-hearted, intelligent and well-educated since childhood. Having spent the last few days in the Rong Mansion she already had some idea of the different characters there; and since the other girls were not frivolous but all very amiable, she was glad to fraternize with them. She was particularly impressed by Daiyu's outstanding charm, and showed her special affection and respect. Baoyu observed all this in silent amazement.\n\nPresently, when Bacchai and Baoqin had gone to Aunt Xue's quarters, Xiangyun to the Lady Dowager and Daiyu to her own room to rest, Baoyu followed Daiyu there.\n\n\"Though I've read The Western Chamber,\" he said with a smile, \"I was reproached once for quoting a few lines I thought were apt in fun. There's one passage I couldn't understand then, but now I do. Let me quote it to you and hear what you have to say.\"\n\nDaiyu, sensing that there was something behind this, smiled and said, \"Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"In the scene 'Creating a Disturbance' there's the line: 'When did Meng Kuang offer Liang Hong his wife's hand?' Of course that's a classical allusion, but the three words 'when did' are the key to the whole thing. 'When did' they become so friendly? Tell me.\"\n\nDaiyu could not help laughing.\n\n\"That's a good question,\" she cried. \"A good question in the play, and a good question for you to ask now.\"\n\n\"First you suspected me, but now you've nothing to say.\"\n\n\"Of course she turned out to be such a good person, I'd misjudged her before.\" She went on to remind him how she had been worried at first by her slip about the\n\nHe then made Daiyu tell him exactly what Baochai had said, and all about the bird’s nest and their conversation during her illness. Only then did he understand.\n\n“Of course,” he chuckled. “I was wondering when Meng Kuang had accepted Liang Hong’s tray. So it was that child’s ‘unbridled tongue’ that brought this about.”\n\nDaiyu’s mention of Baoqin reminded her that she herself had no sister, and she started crying again.\n\n“There you go, looking for trouble again,” said Baoyu. “You’re even thinner than last year, yet instead of taking care of yourself you keep on fretting. Every day you have to have a good cry to get through the day.”\n\nDaiyu dried her tears. “Lately I’ve been feeling very low, only I don’t seem to have as many tears as last year.”\n\n“That’s because you’re used to crying and imagine you’ve fewer tears. How can you have less tears?”\n\nAs they were talking a young maid from his apartment brought his red camlet cape.\n\n“The mistress has sent to say it’s snowing,” she announced. “She wants to discuss with you all which day to have the poetry meeting.”\n\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when Li Wan’s maid arrived to fetch Daiyu. Baoyu urged Daiyu to go with him to Paddy-Sweet Cottage.\n\nShe changed into a pair of little red-leather boots inset with gold thread and cloud designs, and put on a deep red camlet cloak lined with white fox-fur, a blue and gold sleeveless jacket with a green glitter and designs of paired rings and lucky signs, and finally a snow-hat. Then the two of them set off through the snow.\n\nThey found all the girls assembled there, all in identical red camlet and woolen cloaks — all, that is, except Li Wan who wore a serge jacket buttoning down the middle, and Baochai who had on a duckling-green cloak patterned with flowers and interlocking designs in foreign gold thread. Xiuyan had on nothing special to keep out the snow.\n\nPresently Xiangyun joined them, wearing the sable hood and large-sleeved ermine-lined coat, with a big sable collar, which the Lady Dowager had given her. Daiyu was the first to greet her.\n\n“Look, here comes the Monkey Sun!” she cried. “She’s wearing a snow-cloak all right, but just to show how rakish she is she’s dressed herself up like a Tartar.”\n\n“You should see what I’ve got on underneath,” retorted Xiangyun.\n\nShe unbuttoned her coat to reveal a lined, semi-new jacket of yellowish green, the cuffs and collar of which were embroidered with five-colour designs of dragons in gold thread. It had a narrow waist and small sleeves, and was fastened with buttons down one side. Under this was a short reddish silk jacket embroidered with dragons, and her waist was clasped by a pale green, five-colour embroidered silk sash. She had on doeskin boots too. The whole effect was most striking.\n\n“Preferring to dress like a boy, she looks even prettier than in girls’ clothes,” remarked the others laughingly.\n\n“Let’s settle the date for the poetry meeting quickly,” said Xiangyun. “Whose turn is it to play host?”\n\n“It was my idea,” said Li Wan. “But the date we fixed has gone by, and the next one is still a long way off. As it’s snowing, I thought we might seize this chance to have some fun, welcoming our new arrivals and writing some poems too. What do you say to that?”\n\n“A good idea,” agreed Baoyu. “But it’s rather late today. If we wait till tomorrow, the snow may have stopped and that would take away all the fun.”\n\n“The snow may not stop though,” said the others. “Even if it does, there’ll be enough snow on the ground after a whole night to admire.”\n\n“This place is all right, but not as good as Reed Snow Cottage,” said Li Wan. “I’ve already sent there to get the floor heated. We can sit round the fire to write poems. The old lady may not feel like joining us, and as this is just a little game of ours we need only let Xifeng know. I think one tael of silver each should be enough. Bring your share to me.” She pointed to Xiangling, Baoqin, Li Wen and Li Qi.\n\nXiuyan put in, “Not counting those five, and not counting Xichun who’s ill or Xifeng who’s asked for leave, if you four club together I guarantee five or six taels will be ample.”\n\nBaochai and the others agreed to this.\n\nWhen they went on to choose a subject and rhymes, Li Wan said with a smile, “I’ve already decided in my mind, but I shan’t tell you till tomorrow when the time comes.”\n\nAfter some further chat they went to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager, and nothing else happened that day.\n\nBaoyu, having this on his mind, slept badly that night. He was up at dawn and, lifting aside the curtain to see that although the doors and windows were still closed the window was brilliantly lit, he felt a sudden dismay, sure that it had cleared up and the sun was shining. But when he hastily got up and raised the blind to look out through the glass, it was not sunlight that had made the window bright but a fall of snow a foot deep during the night, and flakes were still fluttering down as thick as cotton-wool. This delighted him. He made haste to call for his maids. Having washed and rinsed his mouth, he put on a russet woollen gown lined with fox-fur and a sea-otter waistcoat with sleeves shaped like an eagle’s wings, tied a girdle round his waist, pulled on his rain-hat of rattan gold-spangled and his cork snow-clogs, and hurried off to Reed Snow Cottage.\n\nOnce outside his gate, looking around he saw a pure white world. In the distance the green of pines and emerald bamboos showed up clearly, and he himself felt as if he were in a glass bowl. Having rounded the foot of the slope he caught a whiff of cold fragrance. Looking over his shoulder he saw a dozen or so crimson plum-trees in Green Lattice Nunnery where Miaoyu lived, their blossoms red as rouge against the snow, seeming doubly striking and charming. He stopped to admire them for a while before going on. Then he saw someone with an umbrella coming over the humpbacked bridge — one of the maids sent by Li Wan to fetch Xifeng.\n\nBy the time he reached Reed Snow Cottage some maids and nannies were sweeping a path through the snow. This reed-thatched cottage with its mud walls and bamboo lattice windows had been built on the bank by the river, with a thatched verandah on which one could fish through the windows. It was surrounded by a grove of reeds, and a winding path led through this to the bamboo bridge of Lotus Fragrance Anchorage.\n\n“We were just saying we needed a fisherman to complete the scene,” cried the servants at sight of Baoyu in his rain-hat and cape. “And now here you are! The young ladies won’t be coming till after breakfast, you’re much too impatient.”\n\nAt that he had to turn back. Just then, at Seeping Fragrance Pavilion, he saw Tanchun emerging from Autumn Freshness Studio. In a dark red camlet cape with a hood, she was leaning on a young maid with a woman behind her holding a blue silk oiled-paper umbrella. Knowing that she was on her way to the Lady Dowager’s, he waited by the pavilion until she joined him and they left the Garden together.\n\nBaoqin was in her room, washing and changing. Soon all the girls had arrived. Baoyu, clamouring that he was hungry, kept urging the servants to hurry with the meal. When at last it was served, the first dish was steamed lamb in milk.\n\nThe Lady Dowager said, “This is what we old people should eat. It’s a medicine for us, and you young people who’ve never been exposed to the elements shouldn’t touch it. There’s some fresh venison today, you can wait and have that.”\n\nThe others agreed, but Baoyu was too hungry to wait. He soaked a bowl of rice in tea and, making his meal of salted pheasant with it, bolted this down.\n\n“I know you’ve something else on today and can’t even wait to eat properly,” said his grandmother. “Keep that venison for him to have this evening,” she ordered.\n\n“There’s plenty,” said Xifeng. “He can have some now and some later.”\n\nXiangyun whispered to Baoyu, “Do ask for some of that fresh venison. If we take a piece to the Garden we can cook it there and have some fun.”\n\nHe promptly asked Xifeng for a piece and sent a nurse to take it to the Garden.\n\nThey all went into the garden then and assembled in Reed Snow Cottage, where Li Wan set the subject and rhymes for their poems. But Xiangyun and Baoyu were missing.\n\n“Those two simply can’t keep out of mischief when they’re together,” remarked Daiyu. “I’ll bet they’ve hatched some plot to get that venison.”\n\nJust then Aunt Li arrived to watch the fun.\n\n“How is it,” she asked Li Wan, “that young fellow with the jade and that girl with the golden kylin pendant, who look so delicate and refined and certainly aren’t starved, are planning to eat raw meat? They were discussing it so seriously, I could hardly believe my ears. How can people eat raw meat?”\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n“Good gracious!” they cried. “Quick, fetch them here.”\n\n“This is all that Yun’s doing,” chuckled Daiyu. “I was sure of it.”\n\nLi Wan went out at once to fetch the two culprits.\n\n“If you want to eat raw meat,” she told them, “I’ll take you to the old lady to eat it there. You can stuff yourselves with a whole raw deer and make yourselves ill for all I care. On a snowy day like this, I’m not going to let you spoil our fun. Come and write poems.”\n\n“There’s no such thing,” Baoyu assured her. “We’re meaning to roast it.”\n\n“In that case, all right.”\n\nJust then some old women arrived with an iron stove, gridiron, skewers and wire covers.\n\n“Be careful now,” warned Li Wan. “If you cut yourselves, don’t blame me.” Then she went back.\n\nXifeng had sent Pinger with a message that she was too busy distributing the New-Year allowances to come. But now that Xiangyun had got hold of Pinger she wouldn’t let her go. And Pinger, who enjoyed fun and was used to doing everything with Xifeng, was only too glad to join them. She took off her bracelets, and the three of them sat round the fire to barbecue the meat. Baochai and Daiyu, accustomed to such things, were not surprised, but Baoqin and Aunt Li thought it most eccentric.\n\nTanchun and Li Wan, having decided on the subject and rhymes, came over to join the others.\n\n“What a delicious smell!” exclaimed Tanchun. “I’m going to have some too.”\n\nShe went to find the barbecue party, followed by Li Wan.\n\n“All our guests are here,” said Li Wan. “Haven’t you had enough yet?”\n\n“Eating this makes me feel like drinking,” replied Xiangyun with her mouth full. “And unless I drink I can’t write poetry. If not for this venison, I’d never be able to write today.”\n\nJust then Baoqin in her wild-duck down cape came over to watch, smiling.\n\n“You silly thing!” cried Xiangyun. “Come and taste some.”\n\n“It doesn’t look very nice,” said Baoqin.\n\nBut Baochai urged her, “Do try it, it’s really good. Cousin Lin’s so delicate, it wouldn’t agree with her; otherwise she’d like it too.”\n\nSo Baoqin went over and ate a piece, which she found so good that she joined them.\n\nThen Xifeng sent a young maid to fetch Pinger.\n\n“Miss Shi is keeping me here,” Pinger told her. “You go back first.”\n\nThe maid went away, and presently Xifeng herself appeared, wrapped in a purple woollen cape.\n\n“So you’re enjoying such good things without telling me!” she cried, joining the group.\n\n“Where did this horde of beggars come from?” cried Daiyu. “Well, well, Reed Snow Cottage is ravaged today, all on account of that Yun. I mourn for Reed Snow Cottage!”\n\nXiangyun retorted scornfully, “You know nothing about it, ‘True wits are always free and easy.’ It’s you hypocrites who are so disgusting. At the moment we’re eating this venison and drinking; but presently we’ll show our sterling worth in poetry.”\n\nBaochai teased, “If by the time you come back you can’t produce good poems, you’ll have to pay for that venison by eating all the reeds under the snow to make up for this havoc.”\n\nBy now they had all finished eating and were washing their hands. But when Pinger went to put on her bracelets, she found one missing. She looked high and low for it, but there was no trace of it.\n\n\"Really?\" Xifeng smiled. \"I know where to find that bracelet. Just concentrate on your poems. There's no need to look for it. Go on ahead, and I guarantee you'll have it back within three days.\" She asked, \"What poems are you doing today? The old lady says New Year is coming soon and we should make up some lantern riddles in the first month to amuse everyone.\"\n\nThey all laughed and agreed, \"Yes, we'd forgotten that. We must quickly make up some good ones for the first month.\"\n\nThey went then to the room with the heated floor, where a feast was already spread and the subject, rhyme and metre for the poems were posted on the wall. Baoyu and Xiangyun saw that the subject was \"Composed Impromptu\" and the form a five-character regulated verse with the rhyme \"second Xiao.\" The order in which they were to write had not yet been specified.\n\nLi Wan said, \"I'm no good at verses, so I'll just make the first three lines, then whoever is ready first can carry on.\"\n\nBaochai objected, \"We must decide on the order.\"\n\nTo know how they did this, read the following chapter."
