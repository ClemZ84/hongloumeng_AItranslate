  "original": "话说薛姨妈听了薛蝌的来书，因叫进小厮，问道：“你听见你大爷说，到底是怎么就把人打死了呢？”小厮道：“小的也没听真切。那一日，大爷告诉二爷说……”说着回头看了一看，见无人，才说道：“大爷说，自从家里闹的特利害，大爷也没心肠了，所以要到南边置货去。这日想着约一个人同行，这人在咱们这城南二百多地住。大爷找他去了，遇见在先和大爷好的那个蒋玉函，带着些小戏子进城，大爷同他在个铺子里吃饭喝酒。因为这当槽儿的尽着拿眼瞟蒋玉函，大爷就有了气了。后来蒋玉函走了。第二天，大爷就请找的那个人喝酒。酒后想起头一天的事来，叫那当槽儿的换酒，那当槽儿的来迟了，大爷就骂起来了。那个人不依，大爷就拿起酒碗照他打去。谁知那个人也是个泼皮，便把头伸过来叫大爷打。大爷拿碗就砸他的脑袋，一下子就冒了血了，躺在地下。头里还骂，后头就不言语了。”薛姨妈道：“怎么也没人劝劝吗？”那小厮道：“这个没听见大爷说，小的不敢妄言。”薛姨妈道：“你先去歇歇罢。”小厮答应出来。\n　　这里薛姨妈自来见王夫人，托王夫人转求贾政。贾政问了前后，也只好含糊应了，只说等薛蝌递了呈子，看他本县怎么批了，再作道理。这里薛姨妈又在当铺里兑了银子，叫小厮赶着去了。三日后果有回信，薛姨妈接着了，即叫小丫头告诉宝钗，连忙过来看了。只见书上写道：\n　　带去银两做了衙门上、下使费。哥哥在监，也不大吃苦，请太太放心。独是这里的人很刁，尸亲见证都不依，连哥哥请的那个朋友也帮着他们。我与李祥两个俱系生地生人，幸找着一个好先生，许他银子，才讨个主意，说是须得拉扯着同哥哥喝酒的吴良，弄人保出他来，许他银两，叫他撕掳。他若不依，便说张三是他打死，明推在异乡人身上。他吃不住，就好办了。我依着他，果然吴良出来。现在买嘱尸亲见证，又做了一张呈子，前日递的，今日批来，请看呈底便知。\n　　因又念呈底道：\n　　具呈人某，呈为兄遭飞祸、代伸冤抑事：窃生胞兄薛蟠，本藉南京，寄寓西京，于某年月日，备本往南贸易。去未数日，家奴送信回家，说遭人命，生即奔宪治，知兄误伤张姓。及至囹圄，据兄泣告，实与张姓素不相认，并无仇隙。偶因换酒角口，先兄将酒泼地，恰值张三低头拾物，一时失手，酒碗误碰囟门身死。蒙恩拘讯，兄惧受刑，承认斗殴致死。仰蒙宪天仁慈，知有冤抑，尚未定案。生兄在禁，具呈诉辩，有于例禁；生念手足，冒死代呈。伏乞宪慈恩准提证质讯，开恩莫大，生等举家仰戴鸿仁，永永无既矣。激切上呈。\n　　批的是：\n　　尸场检验，证据确凿。且并未用刑，尔兄自认斗杀，招供在案。今尔远来，并非目睹，何得捏词妄控？理应治罪，姑念为兄情切，且恕。不准。\n　　薛姨妈听到那里，说道：“这不是救不过来了么？这怎么好呢？”宝钗道：“二哥的书还没看完，后面还有呢。”因又念道：“有要紧的问来使便知。”\n　　薛姨妈便问来人。因说道：“县里早知我们的家当充足。须得在京里谋干得大情，再送一分大礼，还可以复审，从轻定案。太太此时必得快办，再迟了就怕大爷要受苦了。”薛姨妈听了，叫小厮自去，即刻又到贾府与王夫人说明原委，恳求贾政。贾政只肯托人与知县说情，不肯提及银物。薛姨妈恐不中用，求凤姐与贾琏说了，花上几千银子，才把知县买通。\n　　薛蝌那里也便弄通了，然后知县挂牌坐堂，传齐了一干邻保、证见、尸亲人等，监里提出薛蟠，刑房书吏俱一一点名。知县便叫地保对明初供，又叫尸亲张王氏并尸叔张二问话。张王氏哭禀：“小的的男人是张大，南乡里住，十八年头里死了。大儿子、二儿子，也都死了。光留下这个死的儿子，叫张三，今年二十三岁，还没有娶女人呢。为小人家里穷，没得养活，在李家店里做当槽儿的。那一天晌午，李家店里打发人来叫俺，说：‘你儿子叫人打死了。’我的青天老爷！小的就唬死了！跑到那里，看见我儿子头破血出的躺在地下喘气儿，问他话也说不出来，不多一会儿就死了。小人就要揪住这个小杂种拼命！”众衙役吆喝一声，张王氏便磕头道：“求青天老爷伸冤！小人就只这一个儿子了。”\n　　知县便叫：“下去。”又叫李家店的人问道：“那张三是在你店内佣工的么？”那李二回道：“不是佣工，是做当槽儿的。”知县道：“那日尸场上，你说张三是薛蟠将碗砸死的，你亲眼见的么？”李二说道：“小的在柜上，听见说客房里要酒，不多一回，便听见说，‘不好了，打伤了！’小的跑进去，只见张三躺在地下，也不能言语。小的便喊禀地保，一面报他母亲去了。他们到底怎样打的，实在不知道，求太爷问那喝酒的便知道了。”知县喝道：“初审口供你是亲见的，怎么如今说没有见！”李二道：“小的前日唬昏了乱说。”衙役又吆喝了一声。知县便叫吴良问道：“你是同在一处喝酒的么？薛蟠怎么打的？据实供来！”吴良说：“小的那日在家，这个薛大爷叫我喝酒。他嫌酒不好，要换，张三不肯。薛大爷生气，把酒向他脸上泼去，不晓得怎么样就碰在那脑袋上了。这是亲眼见的。”知县道：“胡说，前日尸场上薛蟠自己认拿碗砸死的，你说你亲眼见的，怎么今日的供不对？掌嘴！”衙役答应着要打。吴良求着说：“薛蟠实没有和张三打架，酒碗失手，碰在脑袋上的。求老爷问薛蟠，便是恩典了！”\n　　知县叫上薛蟠，问道：“你与张三到底有什么仇隙？毕竟是如何死的？实供上来。”薛蟠道：“求太老爷开恩：小的实没有打他，为他不肯换酒，故拿酒泼他。不想一时失手，酒碗误碰在他的脑袋上。小的即忙掩他的血，那里知道再掩不住，血淌多了，过一回就死了。前日尸场上，怕太老爷要打，所以说是拿碗砸他的。只求太老爷开恩！”知县便喝道：“好个糊涂东西！本县问你怎么砸他的，你便供说恼他不换酒，才砸的，今日又供是，失手碰的！”知县假作声势，要打要夹。薛蟠一口咬定。知县叫仵作：“将前日尸场填写伤痕，据实报来。”仵作禀报说：“前日验得张三尸身无伤，惟囟门有磁器伤，长一寸七分，深五分，皮开，囟门骨脆，裂破三分。实系磕碰伤。”\n　　知县查对尸格相符，早知书吏改轻，也不驳诘．胡乱便叫画供。张王氏哭喊道：“青天老爷！前日听见还有多少伤，怎么今日都没有了？”知县道：“这妇人胡说！现有尸格，你不知道么？”叫尸叔张二，便问道：“你侄儿身死，你知道有几处伤？”张二忙供道：“脑袋上一伤。”知县道：“可又来。”叫书吏将尸格给张王氏瞧去，并叫地保、尸叔指明与他瞧：现有尸场亲押、证见，俱供并未打架，不为斗殴，只依误伤吩咐画供，将薛蟠监禁候详，馀令原保领出，退堂。张王氏哭着乱嚷，知县叫众衙役撵他出去。张二也劝张王氏道：“实在误伤，怎么赖人？现在太老爷断明，别再胡闹了。”\n　　薛蝌在外打听明白，心内喜欢，便差人回家送信，等批详回来，便好打点赎罪，且住着等信。只听路上三三两两传说：“有个贵妃薨了，皇上辍朝三日。”这里离陵寝不远，知县办差垫道，一时料着不得闲，往在这里无益，不如到监，告诉哥哥：“安心等着，我回家去，过几日再来。”薛蟠也怕母亲痛苦，带信说：“我无事，必须衙门再使费几次便可回家了。只是别心疼银子钱。”薛蝌留下李祥在此照料，一径回家，见了薛姨妈，陈说知县怎样徇情，怎样审断．终定了误伤：“将来尸亲那里再花些银子，一准赎罪便没事了。”薛姨妈听说暂且放心，说：“正盼你来家中照应。贾府里本该谢去，况且周贵妃薨了，他们天天进去，家里空落落的。我想着要去替姨太太那边照应照应，作伴儿，只是咱们家又没人，你这来的正好。”薛蝌道：“我在外头，原听见说是贾妃薨了，这么才赶回来的。我们娘娘好好儿的，怎么就死了？”薛姨妈道：“上年原病过一次，也就好了。\n这回又没听见娘娘有什么病，只闻那府里头几天老太太不大受用，合上眼便看见元妃娘娘，众人都不放心。直至打听起来，又没有什么事。到了大前儿晚上，老太太亲口说是‘怎么元妃独自一个人到我这里？’众人只道是病中想的话，总不信。老太太又说：‘你们不信，元妃还和我说是：“荣华易尽，须要退步抽身。”’众人都说：‘谁不想到？这是有年纪的人思前想后的心事。’所以也不当件事。恰好第二天早起，里头吵嚷出来，说娘娘病重，宣各诰命进去请安。他们就惊疑的了不得，赶着进去。他们还没有出来，我们家里已听见周贵妃薨逝了。你想外头的讹言，家里的疑心，恰碰在一处，可奇不奇？”宝钗道：“不但是外头的讹言舛错，便在家里的，一听见‘娘娘’两个字，也就都忙了，过后才明白。这两天那府里这些丫头婆子来说，他们早知道不是咱们家的姐姐。我说：‘你们那里拿得定呢？’他说道：‘前几年正月，外省荐了一个算命的，说是很准的。老太太叫人将元妃八字夹在丫头们八字里头，送出去叫他推算，他独说：“这正月初一日生日的那位姑娘，只怕时辰错了；不然，真是个贵人，也不能在这府中。”老爷和众人说：“不管他错不错，照八字算去。那先生便说：“甲申年，正月丙寅，这四个字内，有‘伤官’‘败财’。惟‘申’字内有‘正官’‘禄马’，这就是家里养不住的，也不见什么好。这日子是乙卯，初春木旺，虽是‘比肩’，那里知道愈‘比’愈好，就象那个好木料，愈经斫削，才成大器。”独喜得时上什么辛金为贵，什么巳中“正官”“禄马”独旺：这叫作“飞天禄马格”。又说什么：“日逢‘专禄’，贵重的很。‘天月二德’坐本命，贵受椒房之宠。这位姑娘，若是时辰准了，定是一位主子娘娘。”这不是算准了么？我们还记得说：“可惜荣华不久；只怕遇着寅年卯月，这就是‘比’而又‘比’，‘劫’而又‘劫’，譬如好木，太要做玲拢剔透，本质就不坚了。”他们把这些话都忘记了，只——管瞎忙。我才想起来，告诉我们大奶奶，今年那里是寅年卯月呢？’”宝钗尚未述完这话，薛蝌急道：“且别管人家的事。既有这个神仙算命的，我想哥哥今年什么恶星照命，遭这么横祸？快开八字儿，我给他算去，看有妨碍么。”宝钗道：“他是外省来的，不知今年在京不在了。”说着，便打点薛姨妈往贾府去。\n　　到了那里，只有李纨、探春等在家接着，便问道：“大爷的事怎么样了？”薛姨妈道：“等详了上司才定，看来也到不了死罪。”这才大家放心。探春便道：“昨晚太太想着说：‘上回家里有事，全仗姨太太照应，如今自己有事，也难提了。’心里只是不放心。”薛姨妈道：“我在家里，也是难过。只是你大哥遭了这事，你二兄弟又办事去了，家里你姐姐一个人，中什么用？况且我们媳妇儿又是个不大晓事的，所以不能脱身过来。目今那里知县也正为预备周贵妃的差使，不得了结案件，所以你二兄弟回来了，我才得过来看看。”李纨便道：“请姨太太这里住几天更好。”薛姨妈点头道：“我也要在这边给你们姐妹们作作伴儿，就只你宝妹妹冷静些。”惜春道：“姨妈要惦着，为什么不把宝姐姐也请过来？”薛姨妈笑着说道：“使不得。”惜春道：“怎么使不得？他先怎么住着来呢？”李纨道：“你不怪的。人家家里如今有事，怎么来呢？”惜春也信以为实，不便再问。\n　　正说着，贾母等回来，见了薛姨妈，也顾不得问好，便问薛蟠的事。薛姨妈细述了一遍。宝玉在旁听见什么蒋玉函一段，当着人不问，心里打量是：“他既回了京，怎么不来瞧我？”又见宝钗也不过来，不知是怎么个原故。心内正自呆呆的想呢，恰好黛玉也来请安。宝玉稍觉心里喜欢，便把想宝钗来的念头打断，同着妹妹们在老太太那里吃了晚饭。大家散了，薛姨妈将就住在老太太的套间屋里。\n　　宝玉回到自己房中，换了衣裳，忽然想起蒋玉函给的汗巾，便向袭人道：“你那一年没有系的那条红汗巾子，还有没有？”袭人道：“我搁着呢，问他做什么？”宝玉道：“我白问问。”袭人道：“你没有听见薛大爷相与这些混账人，所以闹到人命关天，你还提那些做什么？有这样白操心，倒不如静静儿的念念书，把这些个没要紧的事撂开了也好。”宝玉道：“我并不闹什么，偶然想起，有也罢没也罢。我白问一声，你们就有这些话。”袭人笑道：“并不是我多话。一个人知书达礼，就该往上巴结才是。就是心爱的人来了，也叫他瞧着喜欢尊敬啊。”宝玉被袭人一提，便说：“了不得！方才我在老太太那边，看见人多，没有和林妹妹说话，他也不曾理我。散的时候他先走了，此时必在屋里，我去就来。”说着就走。袭人道：“快些回来罢。这都是我提头儿，倒招起你的高兴来了。”\n　　宝玉也不答言，低着头，一径走到潇湘馆来。只见黛玉靠在桌上看书。宝玉走到跟前，笑说道：“妹妹早回来了？”黛玉也笑道：“你不理我，我还在那里做什么？”宝玉一面笑说：“他们人多说话，我插不下嘴去，所以没有和你说话。”一面瞧着黛玉看的那本书，书上的字一个也不认得。有的象“芍”字；有的象“茫”字；也有一个“大”字旁边“九”字加上一勾，中间又添个“五”字；也有上头“五”字“六”字又添一个“木”字，底下又是一个“五”字。看着又奇怪，又纳闷，便说：“妹妹近日越发进了，看起天书来了。”黛玉“嗤”的一声笑道：“好个念书的人，连个琴谱都没有见过？”宝玉道：“琴谱怎么不知道？为什么上头的字一个也不认得？妹妹你认得么？”黛玉道：“不认得瞧他做什么？”宝玉道：“我不信，从没有听见你会抚琴。我们书房里挂着好几张，前年来了一个清客先生，叫做什么嵇好古，老爷烦他抚了一曲。他取下琴来，说都使不得，还说：‘老先生若高兴，改日携琴来请教。’想是我们老爷也不懂，他便不来了。怎么你有本事藏着？”黛玉道：“我何尝真会呢。前日身上略觉舒服，在大书架上翻书，看有一套琴谱，甚有雅趣，上头讲的琴理甚通，手法说的也明白，真是古人静心养性的工夫。我在杨州，也听得讲究过，也曾学过，只是不弄了，就没有了。这果真是‘三日不弹，手生荆棘’。前日看这几篇，没有曲文，只有操名，我又到别处找了一本有曲文的来看着，才有意思。究竟怎么弹的好，实在也难。书上说的，师旷鼓琴，能来风雷龙凤。孔圣人尚学琴于师襄，一操便知其为文王。高山流水，得遇知音。”说到这里，眼皮儿微微一动，慢慢的低下头去。\n　　宝玉正听得高兴，便道：“好妹妹，你才说的实在有趣。只是我才见上头的字都不认得，你教我几个呢。”黛玉道：“不用教的，一说便可以知道的。”宝玉道：“我是个糊涂人，得教我那个‘大’字加一勾，中间一个‘五’字的。”黛玉笑道：这‘大’字‘九’字是用左手大拇指按琴上的‘九徽’，这一勾加‘五’字是右手钩‘五弦’，并不是一个字，乃是一声，是极容易的。还有吟、揉、绰、注、撞、走、飞、推等法，是讲究手法的。”宝玉乐得手舞足蹈的说：“好妹妹，你既明琴理，我们何不学起来？”黛玉道：“琴者禁也。古人制下，原以治身，涵养性情，抑其淫荡，去其奢侈。若要抚琴，必择静室高斋，或在层楼的上头，在林石的里面，或是山颠上，或是水涯上。再遇着那天地清和的时候，风清月朗，焚香静坐，心不外想，气血和平，才能与神合灵，与道合妙。所以古人说：‘知音难遇。’若无知音，宁可独对着那清风明月苍松怪石野猿老鹤抚弄一番，以寄兴趣，方为不负了这琴。还有一层，又要指法好，取音好。若必要抚琴，先须衣冠整齐，鹤髦或深衣，要如古人的象表，那才能称圣人之器。然后盥手，焚上香，方才将身就在榻边，把琴放在案上，坐在第五徽的地方儿，对着自己的当心，两手方从容抬起：这才心身俱正。还要知道轻重疾徐、卷舒自若、体态尊重方好。”宝玉道：“我们学着玩，若这么讲究起来，那就难了。”\n　　两个人正说着，只见紫鹃进来，看见宝玉，笑说道：“宝二爷今日这样高兴！”宝玉笑道：“听见妹妹讲究的，叫人顿开茅塞，所以越听越爱听。”紫鹃道：“不是这个高兴，说的是二爷到我们这边来的话。”宝玉道：“先时妹妹身上不舒服，我怕闹的他烦。再者我又上学，因此显着就疏远了似的。”紫鹃不等说完，便道：“姑娘也是才好。二爷既这么说，坐坐也该让姑娘歇歇儿了，别叫姑娘只是讲究劳神了。”宝玉笑道：“可是我只顾爱听，也就忘了妹妹劳神了。”黛玉笑道：“说这些倒也开心，也没有什么劳神的。只是怕我只管说，你只管不懂呢。”宝玉道：“横竖慢慢的自然明白了。”说着，便站起来，道：“当真的妹妹歇歇儿罢。明儿我告诉三妹妹和四妹妹去，叫他们都学起来，让我听。”黛玉笑道：“你也太受用了。即如大家学会了抚起来，你不懂，可不是对……”黛玉说到那里，想起心上的事，便缩住口，不肯往下说了。宝玉便笑着道：“只要你们能弹，我便爱听，也不管‘牛’不‘牛’的了。”黛玉红了脸一笑，紫娟、雪雁也都笑了。\n    于是走出门来。只见秋纹带着小丫头，捧着一小盆兰花来，说：“太太那边有人送了四盆兰花来。因里头有事，没有空儿玩他，叫给二爷一盆，林姑娘一盆。”黛玉看时，却有几枝双朵儿的，心中忽然一动，也不知是喜是悲，便呆呆的呆看。那宝玉此时却一心只在琴上，便说：“妹妹有了兰花，就可以做《猗兰操》了。”黛玉听了，心里反不舒服。回到房中，看着花，想到：“草木当春，花鲜叶茂，想我年纪尚小，便象三秋蒲柳。若是果能随愿，或者渐渐的好来的。不然只恐似那花柳残春，怎禁得风催雨送！”想到那里，不禁又滴下泪来。紫鹃在旁看见这般光景，却想不出原故来：“方才宝玉在这里那么高兴，如今好好的看花，怎么又伤起心来？”正愁着没法儿劝解，只见宝钗那边打发人来。\n未知何事，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Aunt Xue questioned the page her nephew had brought with him and learned from him how Xue Pan had come to kill a man. She told the page to rest, then went to ask Lady Wang’s help and through her appealed to Jia Zheng. He made some noncommittal reply, simply saying that they must wait until Xue Ke had presented his petition and see what the county magistrate decided.\n\nAunt Xue changed some silver at the pawnshop and sent a servant post-haste with it. Three days later a reply arrived. She had it taken to Baochai, who came over at once to read it. The letter said:\n\nThe silver you sent has been used to bribe the yamen. My brother is not suffering in gaol, so don’t worry, madam. The only trouble is that the local people are so cunning. The witnesses and the victim’s family are unaccommodating, and even the friend my brother invited to a feast is siding with them. Li Xiang and I are strangers here, but luckily we found a good lawyer. We promised him a fee and he advised us to get Wu Liang, who was drinking with my brother, released on bail by providing a guarantor, then bribe him to settle the case. If he refused, we were to accuse him of having killed Zhang San and shifting the blame to a stranger. Once he was scared, we could go ahead. We took his advice and got Wu Liang out. Now we have bribed the witnesses and the victim’s family and drawn up a petition which was presented the day before yesterday. We received the reply to it today. I am enclosing a copy for you to read.\n\nHe read out the petition:\n\nThe petitioner Xue Ke, of such-and-such a place, presents the following for his brother who has been wronged: My elder brother Xue Pan, a native of Nanjing residing in the Western Capital, on such-and-such a date set off with capital to trade in the south. A few days after he left, a servant brought word that he was involved in a murder case. I hurried to the court here and learned that he had accidentally killed a man named Zhang. When I went to the gaol, my brother told me weeping that he had never known this Zhang and had no enmity with him. They had quarrelled while he was asking to have the wine changed. My brother threw the wine on the ground, and as Zhang San happened to be stooping to pick something up, he accidentally bumped his head on the wine bowl and died. When arrested and cross-examined, for fear of torture my brother confessed to having killed Zhang San in a brawl. The court in its mercy, sensing that he was wronged, has not yet passed sentence. As my brother in gaol is forbidden to present his case, I risk punishment by pleading for him. I beg the court to order a confrontation and cross-examination. Its great kindness will be eternally remembered by our whole family. This petition is respectfully presented.\n\nThe verdict was:\n“The evidence at the inquest is conclusive. No torture was used; the prisoner of his own free will confessed to killing the deceased in a brawl, and this confession is on record. You who live at a distance and did not witness the crime have no right to bring a false charge. You deserve to be punished, but in view of your fraternal concern you are let off. Case dismissed.”\nAunt Xue exclaimed, “Then there’s no hope! What are we to do?”\n“Cousin Ke’s letter isn’t finished,” Baochai told her. “There’s more.” She read on: “For essential information, you can question the messenger.”\nAunt Xue did so, and the man said, “The yamen knows that our family’s well off. If you can pull strings in the capital and send a handsome bribe, they may reopen the case and give a lighter sentence. You must act quickly, ma’am, or else the master may have to suffer.”\nAunt Xue dismissed the messenger and went straight to the Jia mansion to tell Lady Wang the whole story and beg Jia Zheng to help. He was willing to ask someone to put in a good word for Xue Pan with the magistrate, but not to offer a bribe. Afraid this would not suffice, Aunt Xue asked Xifeng to speak to Jia Lian, who spent several thousand taels to bribe the magistrate.\nThen Xue Ke was able to pull strings too. The magistrate, having posted notice, took his seat in the court and summoned the neighbours, witnesses and the victim’s relatives, then ordered Xue Pan to be brought from goal. The court clerks called the roll.\nThe magistrate ordered the local headman to verify the first deposition, and questioned the victim’s mother née Wang and his uncle Zhang Er.\nWeeping, the widow testified, “My husband Zhang Da lived in the south village and died eighteen years ago. My two elder sons have died too, leaving only this son Zhang San who’s been killed. He was twenty-three and not yet married. Because we’re so poor, to earn his keep he worked as a waiter in Li’s tavern. One day at noon, the tavern sent to ask me to go there. They said, ‘Your son’s been beaten to death.’ Good heavens! I nearly dropped dead! I ran there and found my son lying on the ground, his head smashed and bleeding. He was still breathing but couldn’t speak, and soon he died. I wanted to seize that young bastard and fight it out with him....”\nThe runners shouted her down and she kowtowed, crying, “I beg Your Honour to right this wrong! He was my only son.”\nThe magistrate ordered, “Stand down!” Then he asked the tavern-keeper, “Was Zhang San working for you?”\n“Not as a regular employee, just as a waiter,” Li Er replied.\n“At the inquest you stated that Xue Pan killed Zhang San by smashing a bowl at him. Did you see this yourself?”\n“I was at the counter. I heard the guests in the private room ask for more wine. Soon after that there was a cry, ‘Help! He’s hurt!’ I ran in and saw Zhang San lying on the ground, unable to speak. I reported it to the local headman and sent to let his mother know. I’ve no idea how the trouble started. You must ask the other drinkers, Your Honour.”\nThe magistrate barked, “At the first hearing you testified that you saw it. Why do you say now that you didn’t?”\n“I was too flustered that day to know what I was saying.”\nAt a shout from the runners the magistrate called Wu Liang and asked, “Were you drinking with them? How did Xue Pan assault him? Tell the truth!”\nWu Liang answered, “I was at home that day when Mr. Xue asked me to go drinking. He complained that the wine was no good and wanted it changed, but Zhang San wouldn’t agree. In a temper, Mr. Xue threw the wine in his face. I don’t know how it happened, but the cup hit him on the temple. I saw it with my own eyes.”\n“Nonsense!” The magistrate snorted. “At the inquest Xue Pan confessed to killing him with a bowl.\n\nHow could the deposition today be so different? Slap his face!” The runners made to do this, but Wu Liang entreated, “Xue Pan never fought with Zhang San. It was just that the bowl slipped from his hand and hit Zhang San on the head. I beg Your Honour to question Xue Pan — that would be a favour.”\n\nThe magistrate ordered Xue Pan to step forward and asked, “What grudge did you bear Zhang San? How exactly did he meet his death? Out with the truth now.”\n\nXue Pan said, “I beg Your Honour to be merciful. I really didn’t beat him. I threw wine over him because he refused to change my wine for me. The bowl slipped and hit him on the head by mistake. I tried at once to stop the bleeding, but couldn’t; he lost too much blood and after a while died. The other day at the inquest, afraid Your Honour would have me beaten, I said I threw the bowl at him. I beg Your Honour to show mercy!”\n\nThe magistrate stormed, “You fool! When I asked how you hit him, you said you were angry with him for not changing the wine, so you threw the bowl. Now you say it was an accident!” He blustered that he would have him beaten and the squeezers applied; but Xue Pan stuck to his story.\n\nThe magistrate ordered the coroner to report the injuries listed at the inquest. The coroner declared, “At the inquest the other day, no injuries were found on Zhang San’s body except a wound on the fontanel made by a ceramic shard, one and seven-tenths of an inch long, half an inch deep, the skin broken, the fontanel cracked for three-tenths of an inch. It was a knock by some hard object.”\n\nThe magistrate saw that this tallied with the coroner’s report. Knowing that the clerk had made the offence seem lighter, he did not dispute it but ordered Xue Pan to sign his confession.\n\nWidow Zhang wept and protested, “Your Honour, the other day we heard there were many injuries. Why have they all disappeared today?”\n\n“The woman’s talking nonsense!” fumed the magistrate. “Here’s the coroner’s report. Don’t you know that?” He summoned the dead man’s uncle Zhang Er and asked, “How many wounds were there on your nephew’s corpse?”\n\n“One on the head,” was the prompt answer.\n\n“You see!” The magistrate told the clerk to show the report to Widow Zhang and ordered the village head and Zhang Er to point this out to her. “At the inquest, all the eye-witnesses present testified that there was no fight and it was not a case of manslaughter in an affray,” he declared. He directed that the confession be signed as accidental injury, then had Xue Pan detained pending a detailed report and released the other accused on bail, after which he left the court. Widow Zhang went on sobbing and protesting until the magistrate ordered the runners to drive her out. Zhang Er also urged her, “It really was accidental. How can you accuse someone falsely? Now that the magistrate has passed judgment, don’t make any more trouble.”\n\nXue Ke, who had been waiting outside to find out the outcome, was overjoyed. He sent a man home with a letter, then waited for the report to be ratified so that he could bribe the officials to cancel Xue Pan’s penalty. While waiting he heard people in the street saying that an Imperial Consort had died and the Emperor had suspended his court for three days. Since this place was not far from the Imperial Mausoleum, the magistrate would have to see to the repair of the road and would have no time to attend to this case. So it was no use staying here.\n\nHe decided to go to the jail to tell his cousin, “Don’t worry, but wait here. I’m going home and will come back in a few days.” Afraid that his mother would take this to heart, Xue Pan sent word, “I’m all right. We just have to bribe the yamen again, then I can come home. Mind you don’t grudge the silver.”\n\nXue Ke left Li Xiang there to look after things and went straight home. When he saw Aunt Xue he described how the magistrate had shown partiality and passed judgment of accidental injury. “Later, when we’ve given the dead man’s family a sum of silver, we can get the sentence cancelled and that will be the end of the matter,” he concluded.\n\nAunt Xue, temporarily relieved, said, “I was hoping you’d come back to help at home. We ought to call at the Jia family to thank them; but now that Imperial Consort Zhou has died, they’re going to the Palace every day and their house is left empty. I’ve been thinking of keeping Aunt Wang company there, but with no man in our house I didn’t like to go. Now that you’re back, that’s all right.”\n\n“Outside I heard that the Imperial Consort had died, and that’s why I hurried back,” he said. “How could our Imperial Consort die for no reason? This must be a rumour.”\n\n\"How could she have died so suddenly?\" asked Aunt Xue.\n\n\"She was ill last year, but got over it. This time we didn't hear she was sick, but only that a few days ago the old lady in their mansion was unwell and saw Her Grace the moment she closed her eyes, which worried them all. They made inquiries but nothing seemed to be wrong. The evening before last, the old lady said, 'Why has Her Grace come all alone to see me?' They thought she was raving and paid no attention. Then she said, 'If you don't believe me, listen to this: Her Grace told me, \"Worldly splendour is short-lived. You must know when to retreat.\"' They all said, 'That's only to be expected. Old people are always harking back to the past.' So they didn't take it seriously.\n\n\"Next morning, when there was a commotion in the Palace and it was announced that Her Grace was seriously ill and all ladies with titles must go to pay their respects, they were horrified and hurried there. Before they came back, we heard that the Imperial Consort Zhou had died. So you see, the rumour outside and their suspicions at home happened to coincide. Wasn't that strange?\"\n\nBaochai put in, \"Not only were the rumours outside wrong, but at home too, as soon as they heard the word 'consort' everyone panicked. It was only later that they realized their mistake. The last couple of days, maids and old nurses from Their Ladyships' house told me they knew all along it wasn't our elder sister. When I asked how they could be so sure, they told me, 'Some years ago in the first month, a fortune-teller from another province who was said to be very accurate was recommended. The old lady sent him the horoscopes of all the young ladies, including Her Grace's, to work out. He said, \"I'm afraid the hour given for this young lady born on the first of the first month is wrong. If not, she's surely a noble lady -- she couldn't belong to your mansion.\" The master told him, \"Never mind whether it's wrong or not. Just base your calculations on this.\" Then the fortune-teller said, \"In the four characters for the year jiashen and the month of the first, bingyin, there is 'an official who is injured' and 'wealth run through.' Only in the character shen are there 'a regular official' and 'lu and horse,' meaning this lady cannot be kept at home, nor does her horoscope show much good fortune. The day is yimao, and as wood is in the ascendant in early spring this is 'shoulder to shoulder,' but who knows, the more the better; for good timber has to be cut and trimmed to make a useful vessel. Fortunately, xin metal in the hour is honourable, and the regular official and lu and horse in si are in the ascendant: this is called the 'flying horse carrying the lu.' And again, the day meets the 'special lu,' so this is most honourable. With 'the two virtues, heaven and moon' in the ascendant, she is fated to receive the Imperial favour. If the hour is correct, this young lady is undoubtedly a consort.\" Wasn't that an accurate prediction? We remember him saying too, \"The pity is that her glory will not last long. If she meets with the years yin or the months mao, this will be 'shoulder to shoulder' and 'rival upon rival,' just as when wood is carved too intricately it loses its strength.\" They'd forgotten all this and just panicked. Then I reminded our elder mistress that this year is yin and this month mao.'\"\n\nBefore Baochai could finish, Xue Ke cut in impatiently, \"Never mind about other people's affairs. Since there's this miraculous fortune-teller, I'd like to know what malignant star is in my brother's ascendant this year to land him in such trouble. Give me his horoscope and I'll go to ask the fortune-teller whether there's any danger.\"\n\n\"He came here from another province. I don't know if he's still in the capital or not,\" she answered.\n\nAs she was speaking, Aunt Xue made ready to go to the Jia mansion.\n\nUpon her arrival there, only Li Wan and Tanchun were at home to receive her.\n\n\"How is your nephew's case going?\" they asked.\n\n\"We're waiting for the higher court's decision,\" she told them. \"It doesn't look as if it will be a capital charge.\"\n\nThis set everyone’s mind at rest.\n\n“Last night Her Ladyship was saying how good Aunt Xue was to us when we had trouble here before,” Tanchun told them. “But now that she’s in trouble herself, of course we can’t very well ask for her help. She’s still very worried though.”\n\n“I’ve been feeling bad too at home,” said Aunt Xue. “But with my elder son in this trouble and my younger one away, what use would Baochai be here on her own? Besides, my daughter-in-law is so silly, I couldn’t leave. And now the magistrate here is busy preparing for Imperial Consort Zhou’s visit, so he can’t settle the case. It was only because Pan came back that I was able to get away to see you.”\n\n“Do stay here for a few days,” urged Li Wan.\n\nAunt Xue nodded. “I mean to keep you young ladies company. It’s only Baochai I feel bad about, left there on her own.”\n\n“If you’re worried, aunt, why not ask Cousin Baochai over too?” suggested Xichun.\n\n“That wouldn’t do,” replied Aunt Xue with a smile.\n\n“Why not? She’s stayed here before.”\n\n“You don’t understand,” Li Wan put in. “How can she come now that they’re in trouble?”\n\nXichun accepted this and asked no more.\n\nJust then the Lady Dowager came back. At sight of Aunt Xue, without waiting to greet her she asked for news of Xue Pan. Aunt Xue gave her a detailed account. Baoyu, standing by, heard her mention Jiang Yuhan. He refrained from questioning her in front of the others, but he was thinking, “Since he’s back in the capital, why hasn’t he come to see me?” And he was also wondering why Baochai had not come with her mother. He was still brooding over this when Daiyu came to pay her respects. The sight of her cheered him up a little and pushed Baochai from his mind. He stayed for the evening meal with the Lady Dowager and his girl cousins, after which the party broke up and Aunt Xue spent the night in his grandmother’s inner room.\n\nBack in his own room, Baoyu changed his clothes. Suddenly he remembered the girdle given him by Jiang Yuhan.\n\n“That red girdle you wouldn’t wear that year,” he asked Xiren. “Is it still there?”\n\n“Yes, I put it away. Why do you ask?”\n\n“No reason. I just wondered.”\n\n“Haven’t you heard how Master Xue got into this trouble which may cost him his life, all because he took up with such scoundrels? Why should you want to be reminded of that? Instead of worrying about such pointless things, you’d do better to study quietly and put all these frivolities out of your head.”\n\n“I’m not making trouble. It just occurred to me to ask. It doesn’t matter whether it’s there or not. But one casual question from me always starts you off on a long lecture.”\n\n“It’s not that I talk too much,” Xiren replied with a smile. “But if you’re well-educated and know the rules of propriety, you should try to get on in the world. Then when the one you love comes, she’ll be pleased and will respect you.”\n\nThis reminded Baoyu. “Good gracious!” he exclaimed. “Just now in the old lady’s place there were so many people, I didn’t have a chance to speak to Cousin Lin, and she didn’t take any notice of me either. She left first when the party broke up. She must be in her rooms now. I’ll go and see her.” With that he started off.\n\n“Come back soon,” Xiren called after him. “This is all my fault for making a suggestion which has set you off again.”\n\nBaoyu did not answer but hurried with lowered head to Bamboo Lodge. He found Daiyu leaning over her desk reading. He went up to her.\n\n“So you’re back already, cousin,” he said smiling.\n\nShe smiled back. “Why should I stay when you ignore me?”\n\n“There were so many people talking, I couldn’t get a word in. That’s why I didn’t speak to you.”\n\nAs he spoke he looked at the book she was reading. He could not make out a single word. Some characters looked like the word for peony, but he was not sure.\n\nSome looked like the character 茫; another was like the character 大 with the character 九 and a hook, and a 五 in the middle; still another had a 五 and a 六 on top, then a 木 and another 五 below. Finding this both strange and perplexing he remarked:\n\n“You’re really getting beyond me, cousin, studying this heavenly script.”\n\nDaiyu gave a tinkling laugh.\n\n“A fine scholar you are! Not to know a tablature for the lute!”\n\n“Of course I know what a tablature is. But why can’t I make out a single character? Do you know them, cousin?”\n\n“If I didn’t, what would I be reading it for?”\n\n“I don’t believe it. I’ve never heard that you could play. We have several lutes hanging in our study, but last year when that visitor — what was his name now? Ji Haogu — came, my father asked him to play. He took down one of the lutes, but said they were all no good. ‘If you’re in the mood, sir,’ he told my father, ‘I’ll bring my own lute another day to play for you.’ So I suppose my father can’t play either, and that’s why that fellow never came back. Are you hiding your accomplishments?”\n\n“I’m no player really,” she replied. “The other day, feeling a little better, I took a book on the lute from the big bookcase. It seemed so refined and the theory in it so sound, with clear directions too for fingering, that I felt it must be a good way to cultivate the mind. When I was in Yangzhou I heard something about this and even learned a little, but I gave it up and have forgotten it all. ‘Three days without playing, and listeners will be bored.’ The other day I was reading some notations which had the names of the melodies but not the scores, so I looked out another copy with scores and found it fascinating. But it’s really hard to play well. According to the book, when Shi Kuang played he could summon wind and thunder and dragons and phoenixes. And Confucius learned from Shi Xiang, recognizing from his playing that King Wen was the composer. To play ‘Lofty Mountains and Flowing Streams’ and find a connoisseur like Zhong Ziqi....” Her eyes misted over and she slowly lowered her head.\n\nThis so delighted Baoyu that he cried, “Cousin, this is wonderful! But as I can’t read the notations, do teach me.”\n\n“There’s no need for teaching. Once it’s explained you’ll understand.”\n\n“But I’m such a dolt. You must teach me. For instance, what’s that ‘big’ character with a hook and a ‘five’ in the middle?”\n\nDaiyu laughed.\n\n“The ‘big’ and the ‘nine’ mean that the left thumb should press the ninth marker. The hook and the ‘five’ mean that the right hand should pluck the fifth string. It’s not a character but a symbol, and very easy to understand. There are symbols for the various ways of fingering — intoning, kneading, slurring, appoggiaturas, trembling, flying, pushing and so on — a whole terminology.”\n\nBaoyu was so excited that he capered about.\n\n“Now that you know the theory, cousin, why don’t we learn to play?”\n\n“The lute is an instrument of austerity,” she answered. “The ancients invented it to cultivate their minds and control their passions, to suppress impure urges and avoid extravagance. So to play the lute you must choose a quiet room, either a lofty hall or a pavilion in the upper storey of a building, or among the rocks in a forest, or on a mountain summit or beside a stream at moonlight, when a light breeze is blowing. Then you must burn incense and sit quietly, regulating your breathing and calming your mind till you feel that your heart and soul are in harmony with the divine. If you lack a good understanding of the music, if your fingers are unpractised and your touch not true to the notes, if you are in the least agitated, then you must not play. That is why the ancients said that to find someone understanding to listen is even harder than to find a good player. If the listener knows nothing about music, it is better to play to the clear breeze, the bright moon, the dark pines and rugged rocks, to monkeys and cranes. That is why those who understand music are so hard to find. You must also have good fingering and a good tone.”\n\nPlacing the zither on the table, she sat opposite the fifth marker and, facing the centre of the strings, raised both hands gracefully. Only thus, she said, could both body and mind be in perfect composure. One must also know whether to play soft or loud, fast or slow, and do so with ease and natural dignity.\n\n“We’re only learning for fun,” objected Baoyu. “If one has to be so particular, it’s too difficult.”\n\nAs they were chatting Zijuan came in. At sight of Baoyu she exclaimed with a smile, “So you’re in high spirits today, Master Bao!”\n\n“Hearing my cousin expound this art has suddenly enlightened me,” he answered. “The more she tells me, the more I want to hear.”\n\n“I didn’t mean that, but the fact that you’ve come to our place.”\n\n“Earlier, when my cousin was unwell, I was afraid of upsetting her. Besides, I had school, and so it looked as if we’d drifted apart.”\n\nBefore he could say more, Zijuan interposed, “The young lady’s better now, but since that’s the case, Master Bao, after sitting here for a while you should let her rest instead of tiring her with all this talk.”\n\n“You’re right. I was so carried away that I forgot she may be tired.”\n\nDaiyu smiled. “Talking about this is rather refreshing, not tiring. I’m only afraid that, no matter how much I say, you still won’t understand.”\n\n“Well, in time I’m sure to catch on.” He stood up. “Do rest now, cousin. Tomorrow I’ll ask Tanchun and Xichun to come and learn too, then I can listen to you all.”\n\n“You’re too greedy,” she teased. “Suppose we all learn to play, if you don’t understand it will be like playing the lute to a cow....” This reminded her of something and she broke off, flushing.\n\nBaoyu laughed. “So long as you can play, I’m sure to enjoy it — never mind whether I’m a cow or not.”\n\nAt that Daiyu smiled, and Zijuan and Xueyan laughed.\n\nThey went out then and found Qiuwen with a young maid who was holding a small pot of orchids.\n\n“Someone sent four pots of orchids to Her Ladyship,” said Qiuwen. “As she’s busy she has no time to enjoy them, so she’s given one pot to you, master, and one to Miss Lin.”\n\nDaiyu saw that there were double blooms on some stalks, and this touched her heart, though she could not tell whether she felt glad or sad. She simply stared in silence. But Baoyu, his mind still on the zither, proposed:\n\n“Now that you have these orchids, cousin, you can play The Orchid’s Song.”\n\nThis suggestion, however, rather upset her. Back in her room she gazed at the flowers, thinking, “Plants in spring have fresh leaves and fine flowers. But I’m still young yet already as frail as willow catkins in late autumn. If only I could have my wish, I might grow stronger. Otherwise, I may not last any longer than willow blossoms at the end of spring, unable to stand the wind and rain.” At this reflection, she shed tears again.\n\nZijuan, watching this, could not think what had come over her. Baoyu had been in such high spirits, yet now that she was looking at flowers she was crying again. The maid was wondering how to console her when someone arrived from Baochai.\n\nIf you want to know the reason, read the next chapter."
