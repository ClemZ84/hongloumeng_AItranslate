  "original": "却说黛玉自立意自戕之后，渐渐不支，一日竟至绝粒。从前十几天内，贾母等轮流看望，他有时还说几句话，这两日索性不大言语。心里虽有时昏晕，却也有时清楚。贾母等见他这病不似无因而起，也将紫鹃、雪雁盘问过两次。两个那里敢说？便是紫鹃欲向侍书打听消息，又怕越闹越真，黛玉更死得快了，所以见了侍书，毫不提起。那雪雁是他传话弄出这样原故来，此时恨不得长出百十个嘴来说“我没说”，自然更不敢提起。到了这一天黛玉绝粒之日，紫鹃料无指望了，守着哭了会子，因出来偷向雪雁道：“你进屋里来，好好儿的守着他，我去回老太太、太太和二奶奶去。今日这个光景，大非往常可比了。”雪雁答应，紫鹃自去。\n　　这里雪雁正在屋里伴着黛玉，见他昏昏沉沉，小孩子家那里见过这个样儿，只打量如此便是死的光景了，心中又痛又怕，恨不得紫鹃一时回来才好。正怕着，只听窗外脚步走响，雪雁知是紫鹃回来，才放下心了，连忙站起来，掀着里间帘子等他。只见外面帘子响处，进来了一个人，却是侍书。那侍书是探春打发来看黛玉的，见雪雁在那里掀着帘子，便问道：“姑娘怎么样？”雪雁点点头儿，叫他进来。侍书跟进来，见紫鹃不在屋里，瞧了瞧黛玉，只剩得残喘微延，唬的惊疑不止。因问：“紫鹃姐姐呢？”雪雁道：“告诉上屋里去了。”那雪雁此时只打量黛玉心中一无所知了，又见紫鹃不在面前，因悄悄的拉了侍书的手问道：“你前日告诉我说的什么王大爷给这里宝二爷说了亲，是真话么？”侍书道：“怎么不真！”雪雁道：“多早晚放定的？”侍书道：“那里就放定了呢？那一天我告诉你时，是我听见小红说的。后来我到二奶奶那边去，二奶奶正和平姐姐说呢，道：‘那都是门客们借着这个事讨老爷的喜欢，往后好拉拢的意思。别说大太太说不好，就是大太太愿意，说那姑娘好，那大太太眼里看的出什么人来？再者，老太太心里早有了人了，就在咱们园子里的，大太太那里摸的着底呢。老太太不过因老爷的话，不得不问问罢咧。’又听见二奶奶说：‘宝玉的事，老太太总是要亲上作亲的，凭谁来说亲，横竖不中用。’”雪雁听到这里，也忘了神了，因说道：“这是怎么说！白白的送了我们这一位的命了。”侍书道：“这是从那里说起？”雪雁道：“你还不知道呢！前日都是我和紫鹃姐姐说来着，这一位听见了，就弄到这步田地了。”侍书道：“你悄悄儿的说罢，看仔细他听见了。”雪雁道：“人事都不醒了，瞧瞧罢，左不过在这一两天了。”正说着，只见紫鹃掀帘进来说：“这还了得！你们有什么话还不出去说，还在这里说！索性逼死他就完了。”侍书道：“我不信有这样奇事。”紫鹃道：“好姐姐，不是我说，你又该恼了！你懂得什么呢？懂得也不传这些舌了。”\n　　这里三个人正说着，只听黛玉忽然又嗽了一声，紫鹃连忙跪到炕沿前站着，侍书雪雁也都不言语了。紫鹃弯着腰，在黛玉身后轻轻问道：“姑娘，喝口水罢？”黛玉微微答应了一声。雪雁连忙倒了半钟滚白水，紫鹃接了托着，侍书也走近前来。紫鹃和他摇头儿，不叫他说话，侍书只得咽住了。站了一回，黛玉又嗽了一声。紫鹃趁势问道：“姑娘，喝水呀！”黛玉又微微应了一声，那头似有欲抬之意，那里抬得起？紫鹃爬上炕去，爬在黛玉旁边，端着水，试了冷热，送到唇边，扶了黛玉的头，就到碗边喝了一口。紫鹃才要拿时，黛玉意思还要喝一口，紫鹃便托着那碗不动。黛玉又喝了一口，摇摇头儿，不喝了。喘了一口气，仍旧躺下。半日，微微睁眼，说道：“刚才说话不是侍书么？”紫鹃答应道：“是。”侍书尚未出去，因连忙过来问候。黛玉睁眼看了，点点头儿，又歇了一歇，说道：“回去问你姑娘好罢。”侍书见这番光景，只当黛玉嫌烦，只得悄俏的退出去了。\n　　原来那黛玉虽则病势沉重，心里却还明白。起先侍书雪雁说话时，他也模糊听见了一半句，却只作不知，也因实无精神答理。及听了雪雁侍书的话，才明白过前头的事情原是议而未成的。又兼侍书说是凤姐说的，老太太的主意，亲上作亲，又是园中住着的，非自己而谁？因此一想，阴极阳生，心神顿觉清爽许多，所以才喝了两口水，又要想问诗书的话。恰好贾母、王夫人、李纨、凤姐听见紫鹃之言都赶着来看。黛玉心中疑团已破，自然不似先前寻死之意了。虽身骨软弱，精神短少，却也勉强答应一两句了。凤姐因叫过紫鹃，问道：“姑娘也不至这样。这是怎么说，你这样唬人？”紫鹃道：“实在头里看着不好，才敢去告诉的。回来见姑娘竟好了许多，也就怪了。”贾母笑道：“你也别信他。他懂得什么？看见不好就言语，这倒是他明白的地方。小孩子家不嘴懒脚嫩就好。”说了一回，贾母等料着无妨，也就去了。正是：\n　　心病终须心药洽，解铃还是系铃人。\n　　不言黛玉病渐减退。且说雪雁、紫鹃背地里都念佛。雪雁向紫鹃说道：“亏他好了！只是病的奇怪，好的也奇怪。”紫鹃道：“病的倒不怪，就只好的奇怪。想来宝玉和姑娘必是姻缘。人家说的：‘好事多磨。’又说道：‘是姻缘棒打不回。’这么看起来，人心天意，他们两个竟是天配的了。再者，你想那一年，我说了林姑娘要回南去，把宝玉没急死了，闹得家翻宅乱；如今一句话又把这一个弄的死去活来：可不说的三生石上百年前结下的么？”说着，两个悄悄的抿着嘴笑了一回。雪雁又道：“幸亏好了，咱们明儿再别说了。就是宝玉娶了别的人家儿的姑娘，我亲见他在那里结亲，我也再不露一句话了。”紫鹃笑道：“这就是了。”\n　　不但紫鹃和雪雁在私下里讲究，就是众人也都知道黛玉的病也病的奇怪，好也好得奇怪，三三两两，唧唧哝哝议论着。不多几时，连凤姐儿也知道了，邢、王二夫人也有些疑惑，倒是贾母略猜着了八九。那时正值邢、王二夫人、凤姐等在贾母房中说闲话，说起黛玉的病来。贾母道：“我正要告诉你们。宝玉和林丫头是从小儿在一处的，我只说小孩子们怕什么。以后时常听得林丫头忽然病，忽然好，都为有了些知觉了。所以我想他们若尽着搁在一块儿，毕竟不成体统。你们怎么说？”王夫人听了，便呆了一呆，只得答应道：“林姑娘是个有心计儿的。至于宝玉，呆头呆脑，不避嫌疑是有的。看起外面，却还都是个小孩儿形象。此时若忽然或把那一个分出园外，不是倒露了什么痕迹了？古来说的：‘男大须婚，女大须嫁。’老太太想，倒是赶着把他们的事办办也罢了。”贾母皱了一皱眉，说道：“林丫头的乖僻，虽也是他的好处，我的心里不把林丫头配他，也是为这点子。况且林丫头这样虚弱，恐不是有寿的。只有宝玉丫头最妥。”王夫人道：“不但老太太这么想，我们也是这么。但林姑娘也得给他说了人家儿才好。不然，女孩儿家长大了，那个没有心事？倘或真与宝玉有些私心，若知道宝玉定下宝丫头，那倒不成事了。”贾母道：“自然先给宝玉娶了亲，然后给林丫头说人家。再没有先是外人、后是自己的，况且林丫头年纪到底比宝玉小两岁。依你们这么说，倒是宝玉定亲的话，不许叫他知道倒罢了。”凤姐便吩咐众丫头们道：“你们听见了？宝二爷定亲的话，不许混吵嚷；若有多嘴的，提防着他的皮！”贾母又向凤姐道：“凤哥儿，你如今自从身上不大好，也不大管园里的事了。我告诉你，须得经点儿心。不但这个，就象前年那些人喝酒耍钱，都不是事。你还精细些，少不得多分点心儿，严紧严紧他们才好。况且我看他们也就还服你些。”凤姐答应了。娘儿们又说了一回话，方各自散了。\n　　从此，凤姐常到园中照料。一日，刚走进大观园，到了紫菱洲畔，只听见一个老婆子在那里嚷。凤姐走到跟前，那婆子才瞧见了，早垂手侍立，口里请了安。凤姐道：“你在这里闹什么？”婆子道：“蒙奶奶们派我在这里看守花果，我也没有差错，不料邢姑娘的丫头说我们是贼。”凤姐道：“为什么呢？”婆子道：“昨儿我们家的黑儿跟着我到这里玩了一回，他不知道，又往邢姑娘那边去瞧了一瞧，我就叫他回去了。今儿早起，听见他们丫头说，丢了东西了。我问他丢了什么，他就问起我来了。”凤姐道：“问了你一声，也犯不着生气呀。”婆子道：“这里园子，到底是奶奶家里的，并不是他们家里的。我们都是奶奶派的，贼名儿怎么敢认呢？”凤姐照脸啐了一口，厉声道：“你少在我跟前唠唠叨叨的！你在这里照看，姑娘丢了东西，你们就该问哪。怎么说出这些没道理的话来！把老林叫了来，撵他出去。”丫头们答应了。只见岫烟赶忙出来，迎着凤姐陪笑道：“这使不得，没有的事。事情早过去了。”凤姐道：“姑娘，不是这个话。倒不讲事情，这名分上太岂有此理了。”岫烟见婆子跪在地下告饶，便忙请凤姐到里边去坐。凤姐道：“他们这种人，我知道他，除了我，其馀都没上没下的了。”岫烟再三替他讨饶，只说自己的丫头不好。凤姐道：“我看着邢姑娘的分上，饶你这一次！”婆子才起来磕了头，又给岫烟磕了头，才出去了。\n　　这里二人让了坐，凤姐笑问道：“你丢了什么东西了？”岫烟笑道：“没有什么要紧的，是一件红小袄儿，已经旧了的。我原叫他们找，找不着就罢了。这小丫头不懂事，问了那婆子一声，那婆子自然不依了。这都是小丫头糊涂不懂事，我也骂了几句。已经过去了，不必再提了。”凤姐把岫烟内外一瞧，看见虽有些皮绵衣裳，已是半新不旧的，未必能暖和。他的被窝多半是薄的。至于房中桌上摆设的东西，就是老太太拿来的，却一些不动，收拾的干干净净。凤姐心上便很爱敬他，说道：“一件衣裳原不要紧，这时候冷，又是贴身的，怎么就不问一声儿呢？这撒野的奴才，了不得了！”说了一回，凤姐出来，各处去坐了一坐，就回去了。到了自己房中，叫平儿取了一件大红洋绉的小袄儿，一件松花色绫子一抖珠的小皮袄，一条宝蓝盘锦厢花线裙，一件佛青银鼠褂子，包好叫人送去。\n　　那时岫烟被那老婆子聒噪了一场，虽有凤姐来压住，心上终是不定。想起：“许多姐妹们在这里，没有一个下人敢得罪他的，独自我这里，他们言三语四，刚刚凤姐来碰见。”想来想去，终是没意思，又说不出来。正在吞声饮泣，看见凤姐那边的丰儿送衣裳过来。岫烟一看，决不肯受。丰儿道：“奶奶吩咐我说；‘姑娘要嫌是旧衣裳，将来送新的来。’”岫烟笑谢道：“承奶奶的好意。只是因我丢了衣裳，他就拿来，我断不敢受的。拿回去，千万谢你们奶奶！承你奶奶的情，我算领了。”倒拿个荷包给了丰儿，那丰儿只得拿了去了。不多时又见平儿同着丰儿过来，岫烟忙迎着问了好，让了坐。平儿笑说道：“我们奶奶说：姑娘特外道的了不得！”岫烟到：“不是外道，实在不过意。”平儿道：“奶奶说：‘姑娘要不收这衣裳，不是嫌太旧，就是瞧不起我们奶奶。’刚才说了：我要拿回去，奶奶不依我呢。”岫烟红着脸笑谢道：“这样说了，叫我不敢不收。”又让了一回茶。\n　　平儿和丰儿回去，将到凤姐那边，碰见薛家差来的一个老婆子，接着问好。平儿便问道：“你那里去的？”婆子道：“那边太太、姑娘叫我来请各位太太、奶奶、姑娘们的安。我才刚在奶奶前问起姑娘来，说姑娘到园中去了。可是从邢姑娘那里来么？”平儿道：“你怎么知道？”婆子道：“方才听见说，真真的二奶奶和姑娘们的行事叫人感念。”平儿笑了一笑说：“你回来坐着罢。”婆子道：“我还有事，改日再过来瞧姑娘罢。”说着走了。平儿回来，回覆了凤姐。不在话下。\n　　且说薛姨妈家中被金桂搅得翻江倒海，看见婆子回来，说起岫烟的事，宝钗母女二人不免滴下泪来。宝钗道：“都为哥哥不在家，所以叫邢姑娘多吃几天苦。如今还亏凤姐姐不错。咱们底下也得留心，到底是咱们家里人。”说着，只见薛蝌进来说道：“大哥哥这几年在外头相与的都是些什么人！连一个正经的也没有。来一起子，都是些狐群狗党。我看他们那里是不放心，不过将来探探消息儿罢例。这两天都被我赶出去了。以后吩咐了门上，不许传进这种人来。”薛姨妈道：“又是蒋玉函那些人哪？”薛蝌道：“蒋玉函却倒没来，倒是别人。”薛姨妈听了薛蝌的话，不觉又伤起心来，说道：“我虽有儿，如今就象没有的了。就是上司准了，也是个废人。你虽是我侄儿，我看你还比你哥哥明白些，我这后辈子全靠你了。你自己从今后要学好。再者，你聘下的媳妇儿，家道不比往时了。人家的女孩儿出门子不是容易，再没别的想头，只盼着女婿能干，他就有日子过了。若邢丫头也象这个东西——”说着把手往里头一指，道：“我也不说了。邢丫头实在是个有廉耻有心计儿的，又守得贫，耐得富。只是等咱们的事过去了，早些儿把你们的正经事完结了，也了我一宗心事。”薛蝌道：“琴妹妹还没有出门子，这倒是太太烦心的一件事。至于这个，可算什么呢。”大家又说了一回闲话。\n　　薛蝌回到自己屋里，吃了晚饭，想起邢岫烟住在贾府园中，终是寄人篱下，况且又穷，日用起居不想可知。况兼当初一路同来，模样儿性格儿都知道的。可知天意不均：如夏金桂这种人，偏叫他有钱，娇养得这般泼辣；邢岫烟这种人，偏叫他这样受苦。阎王判命的时候，不知如何判法的？想到闷来，也想吟诗一首，写出来出出胸中的闷气，又苦自己没有工夫，只得混写道：\n　　蛟龙失水似枯鱼，两地情怀感索居。\n　　同在泥涂多受苦，不知何日向清虚！\n　　写毕，看了一回，意欲拿来粘在壁上，又不好意思，自己沉吟道：“不要被人看见笑话。”又念了一遍．道：“管他呢，左右粘上自己看着解闷儿罢。”又看了一回，到底不好，拿来夹在书里。又想：“自己年纪可也不小了，家中又碰见这样飞灾横祸，不知何日了局。致使幽闺弱质，弄得这般凄凉寂寞！”\n　　正在那里想时，只见宝蟾推进门来，拿着一个盒子，笑嘻嘻放在桌上。薛蝌站起来让坐。宝蟾笑着向薛蝌道：“这是四碟果子，一小壶儿酒：大奶奶叫给二爷送来的。”薛蝌陪笑道：“大奶奶费心。但是叫小丫头们送来就完了，怎么又劳动姐姐呢？”宝蟾道：“好说。自家人，二爷何必说这些套话？再者我们大爷这件事，实在叫二爷操心，大奶奶久已要亲自弄点什么谢二爷，又怕别人多心。二爷是知道的，咱们家里都是言合意不合，送点子东西没要紧，倒没的惹人七嘴八舌的讲究。所以今儿些微的弄了一两样果子，一壶酒，叫我亲自悄悄儿的送来。”说着，又笑瞅了薛蝌一眼，道：“明儿二爷再别说这些话，叫人听着怪不好意思的。我们不过也是底下的人，伏侍的着大爷，就伏侍的着二爷，这有何妨呢？”薛蝌一则秉性忠厚，二则到底年轻，只是向来不见金桂和宝蟾如此相待，心中想到刚才宝蟾说为薛蟠之事，也是情理，因说道：“果子留下罢，这个酒儿，姐姐只管拿回去。我向来的酒上实在很有限，挤住了偶然喝一钟，平白无事是不能喝的，难道大奶奶和姐姐还不知道么？”宝蟾道：“别的我作得主，独这一件事，我可不敢应。大奶奶的脾气儿二爷是知道的，我拿回去，不说二爷不喝，倒要说我不尽心了。”薛蝌没法，只得留下。宝蟾方才要走，又到门口往外看看，回过头来向着薛蝌一笑，又用手指着里面说道：“他还只怕要来亲自给你道乏呢。”薛蝌不知何意，反倒讪讪的起来，因说道：“姐姐替我谢大奶奶罢。天气寒，看凉着。再者自己叔嫂，也不必拘这些个礼。”宝蟾也不答言，笑着走了。\n    薛蝌始而以为金桂为薛蟠之事，或者真是不过意，备此酒果给自己道乏，也是有的。及见了宝蟾这种鬼鬼祟祟、不尴不尬的光景，也觉有几分。却自己回心一想：“他到底是嫂子的名分，那里就有别的讲究了呢？或者宝蟾不老成，自己不好意思怎么着，却指着金桂的名儿，也未可知。然而到底是哥哥的屋里人，也不好……”忽又一转念：“那金桂素性为人毫无闺阁理法，况且有时高兴，打扮的妖调非常，自以为美，又怎么不是怀着坏心呢？不然，就是他和琴妹妹也有了什么不对的地方儿，所以设下这个毒法儿，要把我拉在浑水里，弄一个不清不白的名儿，也未可知？”想到这里，索性倒怕起来了。正在不得主意的时候，忽听窗外“噗哧”的笑了一声．把薛蝌倒唬了一跳。\n未知是谁，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Daiyu had made up her mind to take her own life, she gradually grew weaker until the day came when she refused all nourishment. During the previous fortnight the Lady Dowager and others had taken turns at her bedside, and sometimes she had still talked a little; but these last two days she had hardly spoken at all. Though her mind was sometimes clouded, she was still conscious at times. The Lady Dowager and the rest could see that her illness had not come on without cause, and questioned Nightingale and Snowgoose several times. How could the two maids dare to say anything?\n\nNightingale for her part had thought of asking Aroma for news, but was afraid this might precipitate a crisis and hasten Daiyu’s death; so when she saw Aroma she refrained from mentioning the subject. As for Snowgoose, her ill-considered report had caused all this trouble and she bitterly repented it, wishing she could grow a hundred tongues to cry, “I never said a word!” Naturally she too kept quiet about it.\n\nNow that Daiyu had stopped eating, Nightingale knew there was no hope. She sat watching her for a while, crying, then slipped out to whisper to Snowgoose, “You go in and keep careful watch. I’m going to report this to the old lady, madam and the second mistress. Things look much worse today.”\n\nSnowgoose assented and Nightingale left.\n\nLeft alone with Daiyu, who was lying in a coma, Snowgoose was appalled. Being young, she had never seen anyone in such a state before and supposed she was dying. This frightened as well as distressed her. She was longing for Nightingale’s return when footsteps outside the window made her think this was her, and feeling much relieved she stood up and lifted the inner curtain to wait. But as the outer portiere was raised, in came Aroma — sent by Tanchun to find out how Daiyu was. Seeing Snowgoose standing there holding up the curtain, she asked, “How is the young lady?”\n\nSnowgoose nodded and beckoned her in. Aroma followed and, noticing that Nightingale was not there, looked at Daiyu. She was horrified to see her at her last gasp.\n\n“Where is Sister Nightingale?” she asked.\n\n“She’s gone to the old lady’s apartments.”\n\nAssuming that Daiyu was no longer conscious and that Nightingale was not there, Snowgoose took Aroma’s hand and asked in a low voice, “Did you really mean it that day, when you told me that some Prince Wang had proposed a match for Master Bao?”\n\n“Of course it was true.”\n\n“When will the betrothal be announced?”\n\n“What betrothal? That day when I told you, I’d just heard it from Crimson. Later on, when I went to the second mistress’ place, she was talking to Pinger about it, and said, ‘That’s just the gentlemen in the outer study trying to get round the master by proposing this. Actually, they’re hoping to make use of him later. Even if Lady Xing says it’s no good, or even if she’s willing and says the young lady’s all right, what judgment has she got anyway? Besides, the old lady already has someone in mind — one of the girls in the Garden. How can Lady Xing know what’s in the old lady’s mind? The old lady only asked her opinion because the master had suggested it; she had to, for form’s sake.’ Then I heard the second mistress say, ‘In Master Bao’s case, the old lady’s sure to want to marry him to one of his cousins. No matter who proposes, it won’t be any use.’”\n\nSnowgoose at this forgot herself and exclaimed, “Well I never! So she’s dying for nothing.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Don’t you know? The other day, when I told Nightingale, my young lady overheard us and that’s why she’s in such a bad way.”\n\n“Lower your voice,” warned Aroma. “She may hear you.”\n\nSnowgoose retorted, “She’s no longer conscious. Look — she can’t last more than a day or two.”\n\nJust then Nightingale lifted the portiere and came in. “So this is what you’re up to!” she cried.\n\n‘Don’t spread such talk outside. Why must you come here and say such a thing? You might as well kill her outright and be done with it!’\n\n‘I don’t believe this story,’ protested Shi-shu. ‘It’s too fantastic.’\n\n‘Dear sister,’ said Nightingale. ‘Please don’t be cross with me, but really, what can you possibly know about such things? If you did, you wouldn’t go around spreading such gossip.’\n\nThe three of them were still talking when they heard Dai-yu give another cough. Nightingale hurried to her bedside and stood waiting. Shi-shu and Snowgoose fell silent. Nightingale leaned over the kang and asked Dai-yu softly:\n\n‘Would you like a drink of water, miss?’\n\nDai-yu gave a faint murmur of assent. Snowgoose poured half a cup of boiling water, and Nightingale took it in her hands. Shi-shu came over to help, but Nightingale shook her head and signalled to her not to speak. Shi-shu checked herself and stood where she was. Presently Dai-yu coughed again. Nightingale asked again:\n\n‘Would you like a drink, miss?’\n\nAgain Dai-yu murmured faintly. She seemed to be trying to raise her head, but was too weak to do so. Nightingale climbed up on the kang and, kneeling at Dai-yu’s side, held the cup to her lips. She tested the temperature and then supported Dai-yu’s head while she took a sip. When Nightingale tried to take the cup away, Dai-yu indicated that she would like another sip, so Nightingale kept the cup where it was. Dai-yu took another sip, shook her head and lay down again, gasping for breath. A little later, she opened her eyes a fraction and said:\n\n‘Was that Shi-shu talking just now?’\n\n‘Yes,’ replied Nightingale.\n\nShi-shu had not yet gone, and came forward at once to pay her respects. Dai-yu opened her eyes a little, nodded and after a pause said:\n\n‘When you go back, give your young lady my regards.’\n\nShi-shu interpreted this as a hint that she should leave, and withdrew quietly from the room.\n\nAlthough Dai-yu was critically ill, her mind was still perfectly clear. She had vaguely overheard part of the conversation between Snowgoose and Shi-shu, but had pretended not to hear, lacking the strength to take any notice. From what they had said, she gathered that the earlier proposal had never in fact been finalized. And then Shi-shu had quoted Xi-feng’s words to the effect that it was Grandmother Jia’s idea, that it was to be ‘an inner-family match’, and that the bride was to be one of the girls living in the Garden. Who else could that be but herself? This thought caused an instantaneous change in her, a sudden passage from the extreme of negativity to a more positive state of mind. She was able to drink a few sips of water and even to ask after Shi-shu. And then, as luck would have it, Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang, Li Wan and Xi-feng, having heard Nightingale’s report, all came to see her. The doubt in her mind had been resolved, and she no longer felt her former desire to die. Although she was still very weak and listless, she was able to say a few words in reply to their enquiries.\n\nXi-feng called Nightingale over:\n\n‘Is she really so ill? What’s been going on? You gave us all a dreadful fright.’\n\n‘She did seem very poorly earlier on,’ protested Nightingale. ‘That’s the only reason I reported it. I think it’s a miracle she’s so much better now.’\n\nGrandmother Jia laughed:\n\n‘You mustn’t take any notice of her. What can she know about it? It was sensible of her to tell us when she thought her mistress was ill. For a young maid, it’s good if she’s willing to use her eyes and her legs and her tongue.’\n\nThey stayed a little longer, and when they saw that there was no immediate danger, Grandmother Jia and the others left. It was a case of:\n\nThe cure of the heart is a matter of the heart;\n\nAnd the one who tied the bell is the one to untie it.\n\nWe leave Dai-yu convalescing, and turn instead to Snowgoose and Nightingale, who were privately exclaiming what a miracle it was.\n\n‘Thank goodness she’s better!’ said Snowgoose. ‘But it was a strange illness, and a strange recovery.’\n\n‘There was nothing so strange about the illness,’ replied Nightingale. ‘But the recovery certainly was a miracle! I think it shows that Bao-yu and our young lady must be destined for each other. You know what they say: “The course of true love never did run smooth.” And “No one can break up a match made in heaven.” It seems as if it’s fated, as if the Lord of Heaven has determined it himself. Do you remember that year, when I said that Miss Lin would have to go back to the South, and Bao-yu...’\n\nWhen Lady Wang said she meant to go south, Baoyu’s frantic distress had thrown the whole household into confusion; and now one word from him had nearly been the death of Daiyu. It really seems to be a predestined bond.” They smiled quietly over this for a while.\n\nThen Xuanyan said, “Thank goodness she’s better now. Let’s never refer to this again. Even if Baoyu marries someone else and I see the wedding with my own eyes, I won’t breathe a word about it.”\n\n“That’s right,” agreed Zijuan.\n\nNot only did they discuss this in private, but others too were saying that Daiyu’s illness and recovery were both strange. They talked it over in little groups, and before long this came to the ears of Xifeng, and even Lady Xing and Lady Wang were rather perplexed, only the Lady Dowager had a rough idea of the truth.\n\nOne day, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xifeng were chatting with the old lady when the conversation turned to Daiyu’s illness.\n\n“I’ve been meaning to tell you,” said the Lady Dowager. “Baoyu and that Daiyu have been together since they were children, and I thought as they were youngsters it didn’t matter. But now I keep hearing that Daiyu is subject to sudden relapses and equally sudden recoveries, which shows she’s old enough to have some ideas of her own. So I think if they go on staying together it won’t be quite proper. What’s your opinion?”\n\nLady Wang was taken aback but had to answer, “Miss Lin is a clever girl. As for Baoyu, he’s so simple and silly he may offend against the rules of propriety. Outwardly, though, they still seem just like children. If we suddenly separate them now, won’t that make people suspect something? As the old saying goes, ‘When a boy grows up he should marry, and when a girl grows up she should be betrothed.’ I think the best thing, madam, would be to hurry on with their marriage.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager frowned.\n\n“Daiyu’s eccentricity is one of her good points,” she said. “But the very reason I don’t want her for Baoyu is that she’s so frail and probably won’t live long. The only suitable wife for him is Baochai.”\n\n“We agree with you, madam,” replied Lady Wang. “But we ought to find someone else for Miss Lin. If we don’t, as she’s growing up she may get some foolish ideas. And if she really has designs on Baoyu and hears that he’s engaged to Baochai, that would be disastrous.”\n\n“Of course Baoyu must marry first, then we can find a husband for Daiyu. We can’t put an outsider before one of our own. Besides, Daiyu’s two years younger than Baoyu. So according to you, we mustn’t let her know that Baoyu’s engaged.”\n\nXifeng told the maids, “Did you hear that? No one must blab about Master Bao’s engagement. If anyone talks out of turn, I’ll have her skinned alive!”\n\nThe Lady Dowager said to Xifeng, “You’ve not been well yourself lately, Feng, so you’ve not been supervising the Garden. Still, I want you to keep your wits about you. Not only in this matter, but in general. Those drinking and gambling parties of the year before last were a scandal. You’re more clear-headed than the rest, so I’d like you to take more charge and keep a tighter rein on the servants. Besides, I think they’re more afraid of you.”\n\nXifeng promised to do her best, and after a little more chat they dispersed.\n\nAfter this, Xifeng often went to the Garden to see that all was well. One day she had just entered it and reached the bank of Purple Caltrop Isle when she heard an old woman shouting. The woman at once stopped when Xifeng came up and stood respectfully at attention.\n\n“What are you making such a row about?” demanded Xifeng.\n\n\"I was watching the fruit and flowers and had done nothing wrong, yet Miss Xing’s maid called us thieves.”\n“Why was that?” asked Xifeng.\n“Yesterday my son Heier came here with me to play. Not knowing any better, he went to have a look at Miss Xing’s place, but I made him come straight home. This morning I heard from her maids that they’d lost something, and when I asked what it was they started questioning me.”\n“What if they did? There was no call to take offence.”\n“After all, this garden belongs to Your Ladyship’s family, not to theirs. We were assigned to work here by Your Ladyship; so how can we let them call us thieves?”\nXifeng spat in her face. “How dare you gabble away in front of me like that?” she fumed. “If you’re in charge here and the young lady loses something, it’s up to you to make inquiries. How can you talk such nonsense? Send for Lin Zhixiao’s wife and have this woman packed off!” she ordered the maids.\nAs they assented, Xiuyan hurried out to meet Xifeng with a conciliatory smile.\n“You mustn’t do that,” she said. “It was nothing. The whole thing’s over and done with.”\n“This isn’t the point, my dear,” replied Xifeng. “The fact is, she has no respect for your position. It’s outrageous.”\nBy now the woman was on her knees pleading for forgiveness, and Xiuyan hastily invited Xifeng to her room.\n“I know this kind of creature,” Xifeng told her. “If I weren’t here, she’d have no respect for any of her superiors.”\nXiuyan pleaded repeatedly for the woman, taking the blame on her own maid.\n“Out of regard for Miss Xing, I’ll let you off this time,” said Xifeng.\nThe woman kotowed to her then to Xiuyan before withdrawing.\nThe two young women now asked Xifeng to be seated.\n“What have you lost?” she inquired with a smile.\n“Nothing of any importance — just a red jacket, rather an old one. I told the maids to look for it, and if they couldn’t find it, not to worry. But the silly child had to ask that woman, who of course took offence. I’ve given my maid a scolding for being so stupid. The whole thing’s over, so please don’t give it another thought.”\nXifeng, looking Xiuyan up and down, saw that although she had some fur-lined clothes they were none too new and probably not warm, and that her bedding was rather thin. As for the things on her table, although the old lady had given her some she had not used them, having put them neatly away; and this won Xifeng’s respect.\n“It’s not the jacket that matters,” she said. “But in this cold weather it’s the one you wear next to your skin; so of course your maid had to ask. That old bitch is getting above herself.”\nAfter sitting a while longer, Xifeng took her leave and went to different apartments to pay brief calls before returning home. She told Pinger to wrap up a bright red foreign crepe jacket, a leek-green pongee lined with ermine, a sapphire-blue embroidered skirt and a slate-blue squirrel cape, and send them to Xiuyan.\nThe old woman’s tirade had left Xiuyan on edge, and although Xifeng had silenced her she still felt upset.\n“All the other girls here have servants who wouldn’t dare offend them,” she reflected. “I’m the only one whose maids are insulted, and Xifeng happened to see it.”\nThis line of thought reduced her to silent weeping. Just then Feng’er arrived with the clothes, but Xiuyan absolutely declined to accept them.\n“My mistress said that if you think these are too shabby, another day she’ll send you new ones,” said Feng’er.\nXiuyan smiled her thanks and said, “I appreciate her kindness. But because I lost a jacket I can’t possibly accept these.”\n\n\"Take them back, and thank your mistress very much! I appreciate her kindness but cannot accept these.\" She gave the purse to Feng-erh, who had to take it away.\n\nPresently, Ping-erh came back with Feng-erh. Hsiu-yen stepped forward to greet her and offered her a seat.\n\n\"Our mistress says you're being too much of a stranger,\" announced Ping-erh.\n\n\"It's not that, I just feel bad about it.\"\n\n\"Our mistress says if you won't accept these clothes, it means either you think them too shabby or you look down on her. She told me just now that if I take them back she won't let me off lightly.\"\n\nHsiu-yen flushed and accepted them with a smile of thanks. \"In that case, I don't dare refuse,\" she said, then urged Ping-erh to have some tea.\n\nWhen Ping-erh and Feng-erh left and were approaching His-feng's quarters, they met an old woman sent from Aunt Hsueh's house who greeted them.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Ping-erh.\n\n\"Our mistress and young lady sent me to pay respects to all the ladies and young ladies. I asked just now at your place, madam, and was told you'd gone to the Garden. Have you come from Miss Hsing's place?\"\n\n\"How did you guess?\"\n\n\"I heard tell just now. The way Madam Lien and you young ladies do things is really heart-warming.\"\n\nPing-erh smiled. \"Come in and sit down,\" she said.\n\n\"I've other things to do. I'll call another day to see you, miss.\" With that the old woman went on her way.\n\nPing-erh went back and reported this to His-feng. But no more of this.\n\nIn Aunt Hsueh's house, Chin-kueh was still making trouble. When the old woman came back and reported Hsiu-yen's case, Pao-chai and her mother could not hold back their tears.\n\n\"Because your brother's away, poor Hsiu-yen has to put up with all this,\" said Pao-chai. \"It's lucky that Cousin Hsi-feng's been so good to her. We must keep an eye on her too -- after all, she's one of our family.\"\n\nJust then Hsueh Ko came in. \"What sort of people has my brother been mixing with outside all these years?\" he fumed. \"Not a single decent one! They're all rabble of rogues. They pretend to be concerned, but actually they come to fish for information. The last couple of days I've been driving them away. I've given orders to the gateman not to admit such people in future.\"\n\n\"Are they still those friends of Chiang Yu-han?\" asked his aunt.\n\n\"Chiang Yu-han hasn't come, it's the others.\"\n\nThis account distressed Aunt Hsueh. \"Although I have a son, it's as if I had none,\" she sighed. \"Even if his superiors pardon him, he's good for nothing. Though you're only my nephew, you seem more clear-headed than your brother, and I shall have to depend on you in my old age. From now on you must do better. Besides, the family of the girl you're engaged to isn't as well off as before. It isn't easy for a girl to leave home; she can only hope that her husband will make good, so that she can have a decent life. If Hsiu-yen were like that creature....\" She pointed towards the inner room. \"Well, I won't say any more. She's a girl with a sense of honour and some determination, who can put up with hardship or good living. As soon as our present troubles are over, we must settle your marriage to clear my mind of one worry.\"\n\n\"Chin hasn't married yet, that's what's worrying you, aunt. My marriage is a small matter, not worth worrying about.\"\n\nThey chatted for a while longer, then Hsueh Ko went back to his own room. After supper, thinking of Hsiu-yen staying in the Jung Mansion's Garden, he knew that as a poor dependent her daily life must be hard. Besides, they had travelled to the capital together....\n\nHe knew very well what Xia Jingui looked like and how she behaved. It showed that Heaven was unjust to give a woman like her wealth and a pampered upbringing which made her so vicious, while a girl like Xiuyan had to suffer so. How would King Yama judge them, he wondered, when their fate was decided? Depressed by such thoughts, he felt like writing a poem to work off his indignation, but lacked the leisure for it. So he dashed off these lines:\n\nA stranded dragon is like a fish out of water;\nApart, we miss each other in our distress.\nBoth in a sorry plight, both stuck in the mire,\nWhen can we soar up to the azure brightness?\n\nHaving read this through, he thought of sticking it on the wall but felt rather sheepish.\n\n“If anyone saw it, they’d laugh,” he reflected.\n\nThen he read it again. “What do I care?” he muttered. “I’ll stick it up to cheer myself.”\n\nBut after another reading he decided it was no good, and tucked it between the leaves of a book.\n\n“I’m not a boy any more,” he thought, “and now this calamity has befallen our family — who knows how long it will drag on? It’s reduced this delicate girl to such a wretched, lonely state!”\n\nAs he was thinking, Baochan pushed open the door and came in. Smiling, she put a hamper on the table. Xue Ke rose to his feet.\n\n“This is four dishes of sweetmeats and a small pot of wine,” she told him with a smile. “The mistress asked me to bring them to you.”\n\n“It’s kind of her,” he said. “But she could have sent one of the younger maids. Why trouble you, sister?”\n\n“Don’t mention it. We’re one family, Second Master; why stand on ceremony? Besides, you’ve taken so much trouble over our master’s case, the mistress has been meaning for some time to prepare something with her own hands to thank you, but was afraid of gossip. You know how it is in this household — though we talk big we’re not united. If she sent you some things for no good reason, that would set people’s tongues wagging. So today she’s prepared just a couple of dishes and this pot of wine, and told me to bring them to you quietly.” She shot him a roguish glance. “Another time, don’t talk that way — it’s quite embarrassing. We’re only servants. As we wait on the master, why shouldn’t we wait on you too?”\n\nXue Ke, being good-natured and young, had never seen Jin-gui and Baochan behave so amiably before. Thinking that this was because of his help to Xue Pan, he said, “You can leave the sweetmeats, sister, but please take back the wine. I’ve never been much of a drinker. I only drink a cup if I’m forced to, never for no reason. Doesn’t the mistress know that?”\n\n“I can make decisions about other things, but not about this. You know how hot-tempered the mistress is. If I take it back, instead of saying you won’t drink it she’ll accuse me of not doing my best.”\n\nXue Ke had to keep the wine then. As Baochan was leaving, she went to the door to look outside, then turned back to smile at him and point towards the inner house.\n\n“She may be coming herself to thank you,” she said.\n\nNot knowing what she meant, he flushed and answered with an embarrassed smile, “Please thank the mistress for me. It’s cold today, she mustn’t take the risk of catching chill. And as we’re sister and brother-in-law, there’s no call for such formality.”\n\nWithout answering, Baochan went off smiling.\n\nAt first, Xue Ke thought that Jin-gui had really sent these refreshments out of gratitude for his help to her husband; but Baochan’s furtive manner and embarrassing hints rather nonplussed him. Then he reflected, “After all, she’s my sister-in-law. She shouldn’t carry on like that....”\n\nWhat status has she that she should stand on ceremony? Or perhaps Baochan herself felt too shy to take the initiative and used her mistress’s name instead. But still, she belongs to my cousin....”\n\nThen another idea struck him. “Jin-gui has never behaved according to the rules for women. Sometimes she’s dolled herself up in a most seductive way, fancying herself a beauty. Could she be up to mischief? Or else, because of some falling out with Cousin Baoqin, is she trying to drag me into this too to besmirch my reputation?”\n\nThis thought rather alarmed him. He was at a loss what to do when a sudden chuckle was heard outside the window, making him start.\n\nBut who was it? Read the next chapter to know."
