  "original": "话说宝钗湘云计议已定，一宿无话。次日湘云便请贾母等赏桂花。贾母等都说道：“到是他有兴头，须要扰他这雅兴。”至午，果然贾母带了王夫人、凤姐兼请薛姨妈等进园来。贾母因问。“那一处好？”王夫人道：“凭老太太爱在那一处，就在那一处。”凤姐道：“藕香榭已经摆下了。那山坡下两棵桂花开的又好，河里的水又碧清，坐在河当中亭子上，不敞亮吗？看看水，眼也清亮。”贾母听了，说：“很好。”说着，引了众人往藕香榭来。原来这藕香榭盖在池中，四面有窗，左右有回廊，也是跨水接峰，后面又有曲折桥。众人上了竹桥，凤姐忙上来搀着贾母，口里说道：“老祖宗只管迈大步走，不相干，这竹子桥规矩是硌吱硌吱的。”\n　　一时进入榭中，只见栏杆外另放着两张竹案，一个上面设着杯箸酒具，一个上头设着茶筅茶具各色盏碟。那边有两三个丫头煽风炉煮茶，这边另有几个丫头也煽风炉烫酒呢。贾母忙笑问：“这茶想的很好，且是地方东西都干净。”湘云笑道：“这是宝姐姐帮着我预备的。”贾母道：“我说那孩子细致，凡事想的妥当。”一面说，一面又看见柱子上挂的黑漆嵌蚌的对子，命湘云念道：\n　　芙蓉影破归兰桨，菱藕香深泻竹桥。\n　　贾母听了，又抬头看匾，因回头向薛姨妈道：“我先小时，家里也有这么一个亭子，叫做什么枕霞阁。我那时也只象他姐妹们这么大年纪，同着几个人，天天玩去。谁知那日一下子失了脚掉下去，几乎没淹死，好容易救上来了，到底叫那木钉把头碰破了。如今这鬃角上那指头顶儿大的一个坑儿，就是那碰破的。众人都怕经了水，冒了风，说了不得了，谁知竟好了。”凤姐不等人说，先笑道：“那时要活不得，如今这么大福可叫谁享呢？可知老祖宗从小儿福寿就不小，神差鬼使，碰出那个坑儿来好盛福寿啊。寿星老儿头上原是个坑儿，因为万福万寿盛满了，所以倒凸出些来了。”未及说完，贾母和众人都笑软了。贾母笑道：“这猴儿惯的了不得了，拿着我也取起笑儿来了，恨的我撕你那油嘴。”凤姐道：“回来吃螃蟹，怕存住冷在心里，怄老祖宗笑笑儿，就是高兴多吃两个也无妨了。”贾母笑道：“明日叫你黑家白日跟着我，我倒常笑笑儿，也不许你回屋里去。”王夫人笑道：“老太太因为喜欢他，才惯的这么样，还这么说，他明儿越发没理。”贾母笑道：“我倒喜欢他这么着，况且他又不是那真不知高低的孩子。家常没人，娘儿们原该说说笑笑，横竖大礼不错就罢了。没的倒叫他们神鬼似的做什么！”\n　　说着，一齐进了亭子。献过茶，凤姐忙安放杯箸。上面一桌，贾母、薛姨妈、宝钗、黛玉、宝玉；东边一桌，湘云、王夫人、迎、探、惜。西边靠门一小桌，李纨和凤姐，虚设坐位，二人皆不敢坐，只在贾母、王夫人两桌上伺候。凤姐吩咐：“螃蟹不可多拿来，仍旧放在蒸笼里，拿十个来，吃了再拿。”一面又要水洗了手，站在贾母跟前剥蟹肉。头次让薛姨妈，薛姨妈道：“我自己掰着吃香甜，不用人让。”凤姐便奉与贾母。二次的便与宝玉。又说：“把酒烫得滚热的拿来。”又命小丫头们去取菊花叶儿桂花蕊熏的绿豆面子，预备着洗手。湘云陪着吃了一个，便下座来让人，又出至外头，命人盛两盘子给赵姨娘送去。又见凤姐走来道：“你张罗不惯，你吃你的去，我先替你张罗，等散了我再吃。”湘云不肯，又命人在那边廊上摆了两席，让鸳鸯、琥珀、彩霞、彩云、平儿去坐。鸳鸯因向凤姐笑道：“二奶奶在这里伺候，我可吃去了。”凤姐儿道：“你们只管去，都交给我就是了。”说着，湘云仍人了席。凤姐和李纨也胡乱应了个景儿。\n　　凤姐仍旧下来张罗。一时出至廊上，鸳鸯等正吃得高兴，见他来了，鸳鸯等站起来道：“奶奶又出来做什么？让我们也受用一会子。”凤姐笑道：“鸳鸯丫头越发坏了，我替你当差，倒不领情，还抱怨我，还不快斟一种酒来我喝呢。”鸳鸯笑着，忙斟了一杯酒，送至凤姐唇边，凤姐一挺脖子喝了。琥珀彩霞二人也斟上一杯送至凤姐唇边，那凤姐也吃了。平儿早剔了一壳黄子送来，凤姐道：“多倒些姜醋。”一回也吃了，笑道：“你们坐着吃罢，我可去了。”鸳鸯笑道：“好没脸，吃我们的东西！”凤姐儿笑道：“你少和我作怪。你知道你琏二爷爱上了你，要和老太太讨了你做小老婆呢。”鸳鸯红了脸，顺着嘴，点着头道：“哎，这也是做奶奶说出来的话！我不拿腥手抹你一脸算不得！”说着站起来就要抹。凤姐道：“好姐姐！饶我这遭儿罢！”琥珀笑道：“鸳丫头要去了，平丫头还饶他？你们看看，他没吃两个螃蟹，倒喝了一碟子醋了。”平儿手里正剥了个满黄螃蟹，听如此奚落他，便拿着螃蟹照琥珀脸上来抹，口内笑骂：“我把你这嚼舌根的小蹄子儿……”琥珀也笑着往旁边一躲。平儿使空了，往前一撞，恰恰的抹在凤姐腮上。凤姐正和鸳鸯嘲笑，不防吓了一跳，“嗳哟”了一声，众人掌不住都哈哈的大笑起来。凤姐也禁不住笑骂道：“死娼妇！吃离了眼了，混抹你娘的！”平儿忙赶过来替他擦了，亲自去端水。鸳鸯道：“阿弥陀佛！这才是现报呢。”贾母那边听见，一叠连声问：“见了什么了，这么乐？告诉我们也笑笑。”鸳鸯等忙高声笑回道：“二奶奶来抢螃蟹吃，平儿恼了，抹了他主子一脸螃蟹黄子，主子奴才打架呢！”贾母和王夫人等听了，也笑起来。贾母笑道：“你们看他可怜见儿的，那小腿子、脐子给他点子吃罢。”鸳鸯等笑着答应了，高声的说道：“这满桌子的腿子，二奶奶只管吃就是了。”凤姐笑着洗了脸，走来又伏侍贾母等吃了一回。\n　　黛玉独不敢多吃，只吃了一点夹子肉就下来了。贾母一时也不吃了。大家都洗了手。也有看花的，也有弄水看鱼的，游玩了一回。王夫人因问贾母：“这里风大，才又吃了螃蟹，老太太还是回屋里去歇歇罢。若高兴，明日再来逛逛。”贾母听了，笑道：“正是呢。我怕你们高兴，我走了，又怕扫了你们的兴，既这么说，咱们就都去罢。”回头嘱咐湘云：“别让你宝哥哥多吃了。”湘云答应着。又嘱咐湘云、宝钗二人说：“你们两个也别多吃了。那东西虽好吃，不是什么好的，吃多了肚子疼。”二人忙应着。送出园外，仍旧回来，命将残席收拾了另摆。宝玉道：“也不用摆，咱们且做诗。把那大团圆桌子放在当中，酒菜都放着。也不必拘定坐位，有爱吃的去吃，大家散坐，岂不便宜？”宝钗道：“这话极是。”湘云道：“虽这么说，还有别人。”因又命另摆一桌，拣了热螃蟹来，请袭人，紫鹃、司棋、侍书、入画、莺儿、翠墨等一处共坐。山坡桂树底下铺下两条花毯，命支应的婆子并小丫头等也都坐了，只管随意吃喝，等使唤再来。\n　　湘云便取了诗题，用针绾在墙上。众人看了，都说：“新奇！只怕做不出来。”湘云又把不限韵的缘故说了一番，宝玉道：“这才是正理。我也最不喜限韵。”黛玉因不大吃酒，又不吃螃蟹，自命人掇了一个绣墩，倚栏坐着，拿着钓杆钓鱼。宝钗手里拿着一技桂花，玩了一回，俯在窗槛上，掐了桂蕊，扔在水面，引的那游鱼上来唼喋。湘云出一回神，又让一回袭人等，又招呼山坡下的众人只管放量吃。探春和李纨、惜春正立在垂柳阴中看鸥鹭。迎春却独在花阴下，拿着个针儿穿茉莉花。宝玉又看了一回黛玉钓鱼，一回又俯在宝钗旁边说笑两句，一回又看袭人等吃螃蟹，自己也陪他喝两口酒，袭人又剥一壳肉给他吃。\n　　黛玉放下钓杆，走至座间，拿起那乌梅银花自斟壶来，拣了一个小小的海棠冻石蕉叶杯。丫头看见，知他要饮酒，忙着走上来斟。黛玉道：“你们只管吃去，让我自己斟才有趣儿。”说置便斟了半盏看时，却是黄酒，因说道：“我吃了一点子螃蟹，觉得心口微微的疼，须得热热的吃口烧酒。”宝玉忙接道：“有烧酒。”便命将那台欢花浸的酒烫一壶来，黛玉也只吃一口便放下了。宝钗也走过来，另拿了一只杯来，也饮了一口放下，便蘸笔至墙上把头一个《忆菊》勾了，底下又赘一个“蘅”字。宝玉忙道：“好姐姐，第二个我已有了四句了，你让我做罢。”室钗笑道：“我好容易有了一首，你就忙的这样。”黛玉也不说话，接过笔来把第八个《问菊》勾了，接着把第十一个《菊梦》也勾了，也赘上了一个“潇”宇。宝玉也拿起笔来将第二个《访菊》也勾了，也赘上一个“怡”字。探春起来看着道：“竟没入作《簪菊》？让我作。”又指着宝玉笑道：“才宣过：总不许带出闺阁字样来，你可要留神。”说着，只见湘云走来，将第四第五《对菊》《供菊》一连两个都勾了，也赘上个“湘”字。探春道：“你也该起个号。”湘云笑道：“我们家里如今虽有几分轩馆，我又不住着，借了来也设趣。”宝钗笑道：“方才老太太说，你们家里也有一个水亭，叫做枕霞阁，难道不是你的？如今虽没了，你到底是旧主人。”众人都道：“有理。”宝玉不待湘云动手，便代将“湘”字抹了，改了一个“霞”字。\n　　没有顿饭工夫，十二题己全，各自誊出来，都交与迎春，另拿了一张雪浪笺过来，一井誊录出来。某人作的底下赘明某人的号。李纨等从头看道：\n　　忆菊\n　　蘅芜君\n　　怅望西风抱闷思，蓼红苇白断肠时。\n　　空篱旧圃秋无迹，冷月清霜梦有知。\n　　念念心随归雁远，廖廖坐听晚砧迟。\n　　谁怜我为黄花瘦，慰语重阳会有期。\n　　访菊\n　　怡红公子\n　　闲趁霜晴试一游，酒杯药盏莫淹留。\n　　霜前月下谁家种？槛外篱边何处秋？\n　　蜡屐远来情得得，冷吟不尽兴悠悠。\n　　黄花若解怜诗客，休负今朝挂杖头。\n　　种菊\n　　怡红公子\n　　携锄秋圃自移来，篱畔庭前处处栽。\n　　昨夜不期经雨活，今朝犹喜带霜开。\n　　冷吟秋色诗千首，醉酹寒香酒一杯。\n　　泉溉泥封勤护惜，好和井径绝尘埃。\n　　对菊\n　　枕霞旧友\n　　别圃移来贵比金，一分浅淡一分深。\n　　萧疏篱畔科头坐，清冷香中抱膝吟。\n　　数去更无君傲世，看来惟有我知音！\n　　秋光荏苒休孤负，相对原宜惜寸阴。\n　　供菊\n　　枕霞旧友\n　　弹琴酌酒喜堪俦，几案婷婷点缀幽。\n　　隔坐香分三径露，抛书人对一枝秋。\n　　霜清纸帐来新梦，圃冷斜阳亿旧游。\n　　傲世也因同气味，春风桃李末淹留。\n　　咏菊\n　　潇湘妃子\n　　无赖诗魔昏晓侵，绕篱欹石自沉音。\n　　毫端蕴秀临霜写，口角噙香对月吟。\n　　满纸自怜题素怨，片言谁解诉秋心？\n　　一从陶令评章后，千古高风说到今。\n　　画菊\n　　蘅芜君\n　　诗馀戏笔不知狂，岂是丹青费较量？\n　　聚叶泼成千点墨，攒花染出几痕霜。\n　　淡淡神会风前影，跳脱秋生腕底香。\n　　莫认东篱闲采掇，粘屏聊以慰重阳。\n　　问菊\n　　潇湘妃子\n　　欲讯秋情众莫知，喃喃负手扣东篱。\n　　孤标傲世偕谁隐，一样开花为底迟？\n　　圃露庭霜何寂寞，雁归蛩病可相思。\n　　莫言举世无谈者，解语何妨话片时？\n　　簪菊\n　　蕉下客\n　　瓶供篱栽日日忙，折来休认镜中妆。\n　　长安公子因花癖，彭泽先生是酒狂。\n　　短鬓冷沾三径露，葛巾香染九秋霜。\n　　高情不入时人眼，拍手凭他笑路旁。\n　　菊影\n　　枕霞旧友\n　　秋光叠叠复重重，潜度偷移三径中。\n　　窗隔疏灯描远近，篱筛破月锁玲胧。\n　　寒芳留照魂应驻，霜印传神梦也空。\n　　珍重暗香踏碎处，凭谁醉眼认朦胧。\n　　菊梦\n　　潇湘妃子\n　　篱畔秋酣一觉清，和云伴月不分明。\n　　登仙非慕庄生蝶，忆旧还寻陶今盟。\n　　睡去依依随雁断，惊回故故恼蛩呜。\n　　醒时幽怨同谁诉：衰草寒烟无限情！\n　　残菊\n　　蕉下客\n　　露凝霜重渐倾欹，宴赏才过小雪时。\n　　蒂有馀香金淡泊，枝无全叶翠离披。\n　　半床落月蛩声切，万里寒云雁阵迟。\n　　明岁秋分外再会，暂时分手莫相思！\n　　众人看一首，赞一首，彼此称扬不绝。李纨笑道：“等我从公评来。通篇看来，各人有各人的警句。今日公评：《咏菊》第一，《问菊》第二，《菊梦》第三，题目新，诗也新，立意更新了，只得要推潇湘妃子为魁了。然后《簪菊》、《对菊》、《供菊》、《画菊》、《忆菊》次之。”宝玉听说，喜的拍手道：“极是！极公！”黛玉道：“我那个也不好，到底伤于纤巧些。”李纨道：“巧的却好，不露堆砌生硬。”黛玉道：“据我看来，头一句好的是‘圃冷斜阳忆旧游’，这句背面傅粉；‘抛书人对一枝秋’，已经妙绝，将供菊说完，没处再说，故翻回来想到未折未供之先，意思深远。”李纨笑道：“固如此说，你的‘口角噙香’一句也敌得过了。”探春又道：“到底要算蘅芜君沉着，‘秋无迹’，“梦有知’，把个‘忆’字竟烘染出来了。”宝钗笑道：“你的‘短鬓冷沾’，‘葛巾香染’，也就把簪菊形容的一个缝儿也没有。”湘云笑道：“‘偕谁隐’，‘为底迟’，真真把个菊花问的无言可对！”李纨笑道：“那么着，象‘科头坐’，‘抱膝吟’，竟一时也舍不得离了菊花，菊花有知，倒还怕腻烦了呢。”说的大家都笑了。宝玉笑道：“这场我又落第了。难道‘谁家种’，‘何处秋’，‘蜡展远来’，‘冷吟不尽’，那都不是访不成？‘昨夜雨’，‘今朝霜’，都不是种不成？但恨敌不上‘口角噙香对月吟’、‘清冷香中抱膝吟’、‘短鬓’，‘葛巾’、‘金淡泊’、‘翠离披’、‘秋无迹’、‘梦有知’这几句罢了。”又道：“明日闲了，我一个人做出十二首来。”李纨道：“你的也好，只是不及这几句新雅就是了。”\n　　大家又评了一回，复又要了热螃蟹，就在大圆桌上吃了一回。宝玉笑道：“今日持螯赏桂，亦不可无诗，我已吟成，谁还敢作？”说着，便忙洗了手，提笔写出，众人看道：\n　　持螯更喜桂阴凉，泼醋擂姜兴欲狂。\n　　饕餮王孙应有酒，横行公子竞无肠。\n　　脐间积冷馋忘忌，指上沾腥洗尚香。\n　　原为世人美口服，坡仙曾笑一生忙。\n　　黛玉笑道：“这样的诗，一时要一百首也有。”宝玉笑道：“你这会子才力已尽，不说不能作了，还褒贬人家。”黛玉听了，也不答言，略一仰首微吟，提起笔来一挥，已有了一首。众人看道：\n　　铁甲长戈死末忘，堆盘色相喜先尝。\n　　螯封嫩玉双双满，壳凸红脂块块香。\n　　多肉更怜卿八足，助情谁劝我千觞？\n　　对兹佳品酬佳节，桂拂清风菊带霜。\n　　宝玉看了，正喝彩时，黛玉便一把撕了，命人烧去，因笑道：“我做的不及你的，我烧了罢。你那个很好，比方才的菊花诗还好，你留着他给人看看。”\n　　宝钗笑道：“我也勉强了一首，未必好，写出来取笑儿罢。”说着，也写出来。大家看时，写道：\n　　桂霭桐阴坐举觞，长安涎口盼重阳。\n　　眼前道路无经纬，皮里春秋空黑黄。\n　　看到这里，众人不禁叫绝。宝玉道：“骂得痛快！我的诗也该烧了。”看底下道：\n　　酒未涤腥还用菊，性防积冷定须姜。\n　　于今落釜成何益？月浦空馀禾黍香。\n众人看毕，都说：“这方是食蟹的绝唱！这些小题目，原要寓大意思，才算是大才。只是讽刺世人太毒了些。”说着，只见平儿复进园来。\n不知却做什么，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Baochai and Xiangyun had made their plans, the night passed without further incident. The next day Xiangyun invited the Lady Dowager and the rest to enjoy the cassia. They all said they would be glad to gratify her whim.\n\nAt noon the Lady Dowager, accompanied by Lady Wang and Xifeng, invited Aunt Xue to the Garden.\n\n“Which would be the best place?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Wherever Your Ladyship prefers,” said Lady Wang.\n\n“I’ve had seats prepared in Lotus Fragrance Anchorage,” put in Xifeng. “The two cassia trees down the slope are in full bloom and the water of the stream is so clear. Won’t it be pleasant to sit in the pavilion in the middle of the stream? The sight of the water is so refreshing too.”\n\n“Very good,” agreed the Lady Dowager.\n\nShe led the way to Lotus Fragrance Anchorage. This pavilion, built in the middle of the pool, had windows on four sides and corridors on left and right connecting it with the banks, while a zigzag bridge led to its rear. As the party crossed the bamboo bridge, Xifeng hurried forward to offer the old lady her arm.\n\n“Just take big steps, Old Ancestress,” she cried. “Don’t worry. These bamboo bridges are meant to creek.”\n\nOnce inside they saw that two bamboo tables had been placed outside the railings. One was spread with cups, chopsticks and wine-service; the other with a tea-basket and different kinds of cups and dishes. A few maids were fanning two stoves to boil water for tea, and some others were fanning two stoves to warm up wine.\n\n“This is a fine idea, and everything’s so clean too,” exclaimed the Lady Dowager.\n\n“This was all Cousin Baochai’s idea,” Xiangyun told her.\n\n“I thought as much. That child’s so careful and thoughtful.”\n\nNoticing then a couplet inlaid in mother-of-pearl on black lacquer which hung on the pillars, the Lady Dowager asked Xiangyun to read it out:\n\nThe reflection of lotus-flowers is broken by the returning oars;\n\nDeep in the fragrant lotus roots a bamboo footbridge hides.\n\nThe old lady looked up then at the board above with its inscription, and turned to tell Aunt Xue, “When I was a girl we had a pavilion like this at home called the Pillowed Iridescence Pavilion. I was about the age then of these girls here, and used to go every day with my sisters to play there. One day I lost my balance and fell into the water — they barely fished me out in time to save me from drowning. But in falling I gashed my head on a nail, and here on my temple I still have the scar, as big as the tip of a finger. Everyone was afraid that if my head got wet or I caught cold it might be the death of me; yet I recovered.”\n\nBefore anyone else could speak Xifeng laughed, “If you’d died then, Old Ancestress, who’d be enjoying such good fortune today? It’s clear you were destined from childhood to good fortune and long life — that bang you gave your head was the God of Long Life punching a hole in it for all your good luck to be stored up in. The reason why the God of Long Life’s head bulges so is that it’s stuffed too full of good luck. It’s so crammed, it’s swollen.”\n\nThis set the whole party laughing.\n\n“This monkey’s incorrigible!” cried the Lady Dowager, laughing. “She’s even making fun of me. I’ve a good mind to tear that glib tongue of yours out.”\n\n“I was only afraid the crab might lie cold on your stomach, so I made you laugh to help you digest it,” replied Xifeng. “Then you can eat a couple more without any ill effects.”\n\n“Tomorrow I shall keep you with me day and night to amuse me,” chuckled the old lady. “I won’t let you go home.”\n\n“If you spoil her like this, madam, because you’re so fond of her, and then talk like that, she’ll take even more liberties tomorrow,” said Lady Wang.\n\n“I like to have her take liberties,” replied the Lady Dowager. “Besides, she’s not like a silly child who doesn’t know her place. When we’re on our own like this, it’s only right that we women should have some fun together. So long as the main rules of propriety aren’t infringed, what does it matter? If we put on airs all the time like graven images, wouldn’t that be dull?”\n\nBy now they had entered the pavilion and been served with tea, while Xifeng saw to the setting out of cups and chopsticks.\n\nAt the round table in the centre sat the Lady Dowager, Aunt Xue, Baochai, Daiyu and Baoyu. The eastern table was occupied by Xiangyun, Lady Wang, Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun. At a small table by the door on the west side places had been laid for Li Wan and Xifeng, but neither dared be seated and they were waiting on the two older ladies’ tables.\n\n“Don’t bring too many crabs at a time,” ordered Xifeng. “Keep them in the steamer and bring just ten; we can fetch more as we finish those.” She washed her hands then and stood by the old lady to shell some crabmeat for her.\n\nHer first portion she offered to Aunt Xue.\n\n“I enjoy shelling them myself,” said Aunt Xue. “It’s no fun eating them ready-shelled.”\n\nSo Xifeng gave the meat to the Lady Dowager, and her second portion to Baoyu.\n\n“Bring some well heated wine,” she cried.\n\nShe also told the younger maids to fetch some mung-bean flour perfumed with chrysanthemum leaves and cassia buds for washing their hands.\n\nXiangyun, after joining the others for one crab, left the feast to urge the others to eat, then went outside to order two plates of crabs to be sent to Concubine Zhao. Just then Xifeng came up to her.\n\n“You’re not used to entertaining,” she said. “Go ahead and enjoy yourself. I’ll see to things for you, and have something to eat after the party breaks up.”\n\nXiangyun demurred, but she told some servants to set two tables in the corridor for Yuanyang, Hupo, Caixia, Caiyun and Pinger.\n\nYuanyang said laughingly to Xifeng, “Since you’re doing the honours, madam, we can go and eat.”\n\n“All right, off you go,” replied Xifeng. “I’ll take care of everything.”\n\nSo Xiangyun returned to her seat while Xifeng and Li Wan went and sat down for a while.\n\nPresently Xifeng went out again to see to things. She found Yuanyang and the others in high spirits in the corridor. At sight of her they rose to their feet.\n\n“What have you come out for, madam?” they asked. “Do let us enjoy ourselves for a bit.”\n\n“Yuanyang, you’re getting a bad lot,” scolded Xifeng playfully. “Here am I doing your job for you, and instead of thanking me you complain. The least you can do is pour me a cup of wine.”\n\nYuanyang promptly smiled and filled a cup, then held it to Xifeng’s lips. She tossed it off. Hupo and Caixia then filled a cup each and offered it to her, and she drank both. Pinger had early scooped out some yellow crab meat, and this she now presented.\n\n“Put plenty of ginger and vinegar on it,” said Xifeng.\n\nHaving eaten it she remarked, “You go on with your meal now. I must be off.”\n\n“What a cheek!” Yuanyang chuckled. “Eating our food!”\n\n“Don’t try to get round me. I know our Lian the Second has taken a fancy to you and wants the old lady to let him have you as his concubine.”\n\nYuanyang blushed. “Ugh! Fancy a lady talking such nonsense. I’ve a good mind to smear your face with this messy hand of mine.”\n\nShe started forward to carry out her threat.\n\n“Dear sister, do let me off this time,” begged Xifeng laughingly.\n\nHupo put in, “Yuanyang may let you off, but will Pinger? You’ve not eaten much crab, but you’ve drunk a whole saucer of vinegar.”\n\nPinger, who was shelling a crab with rich cream inside, at this jibe dipped it in the soy and made to smear Hupo’s face.\n\n“I’ll teach you to wag your tongue, you bitch,” she cried laughingly.\n\nHupo dodged and Pinger, thrown off her balance, smeared Xifeng’s cheek by mistake. Xifeng, joking with Yuanyang, was taken by surprise and gave a cry.\n\n“Aiya!”\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\nXifeng could not help laughing too as she swore, “You bitch! Have you lost your eyes, smearing your own mother’s face?”\n\nPinger hastily wiped her clean, then went to fetch water.\n\n“Amida Buddha!” cried Yuanyang. “This is retribution.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager in the inner room heard this gust of merriment.\n\n“What’s the joke?” she called. “Tell us to make us laugh too.”\n\nYuanyang and the others answered loudly, laughing.\n\n“Our Lian Secundo’s wife has come to grab some crabs and Ping’s so angry she’s smeared her mistress’s face with crab yolk,” she announced. “Mistress and slave are fighting!”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and Lady Wang could not help laughing.\n\n“Look at the poor thing,” said the Lady Dowager. “Give her a few of the small legs and the roe.”\n\nYuanyang and the others assented and called out, “There are plenty of legs on this table, madam. Just help yourself.”\n\nXifeng having good-humouredly washed her face came back to wait on the Lady Dowager until she had finished eating.\n\nDaiyu did not dare eat much, only a little meat from the claws, then left the table. Presently the old lady too stopped eating. By now all had washed their hands. Some were watching the flowers, others playing with the water or looking at the fish.\n\n“There’s rather a wind here,” remarked Lady Wang to the Lady Dowager. “And you’ve just been eating crab, madam. Wouldn’t it be better to go inside and rest? If you’re in the mood, we can come again tomorrow.”\n\n“You’re quite right,” replied the Lady Dowager. “I was afraid of spoiling your fun if I left; but since you suggest it, let’s all go.” She turned to Xiangyun. “Don’t let your Cousin Bao eat too much.”\n\nAs Xiangyun promised she told her and Baochai, “You two mustn’t eat too much either. Though crabs are delicious they’re not very wholesome, and too many will give you a stomach-ache.”\n\nThey both assented.\n\nHaving seen the Lady Dowager out of the Garden they came back and gave orders to clear the tables and reset them.\n\n“Don’t bother,” said Baoyu. “Let’s write poems now. We can put that big round table in the middle with the wine and dishes on it. We needn’t sit in order either, but help ourselves to whatever we fancy. Wouldn’t that be more informal?”\n\n“An excellent idea,” agreed Baochai.\n\n“Still, there are the others to consider,” put in Xiangyun.\n\nShe ordered another table to be laid and a fresh supply of hot crabs brought for Xiren, Zijuan, Siqi, Shishu, Ru-hua, Yinger and Cuimo, who were invited to sit together. Two gay felt rugs were spread under the cassia trees on the slope, and the old serving-women and younger maids were told to sit down and eat and drink at their ease until needed again.\n\nXiangyun then fixed the themes for the poems to the wall with a pin. The others exclaimed in delight, “How original! But I doubt if we can do them justice.”\n\nShe explained too that no rhyme schemes were prescribed.\n\n“Quite right too,” cried Baoyu. “I hate regulated verse.”\n\nDaiyu, who had not drunk much wine or eaten any crab, told a maid to put an embroidered cushion for her by the railing. Then, leaning on the rail, she fished with a rod. Baochai played for a while with a spray of cassia, then leaned on the window-sill to break off bits of blossom and throw them into the water to attract the fish, which came up to nibble at them. Xiangyun, after a moment’s reflection, urged Xiren and the others to eat their fill, and called down to the people at the foot of the slope to help themselves freely too. Tanchun, Li Wan and Xichun were standing in the shade of some willows watching the water-fowl. Yingchun, all on her own in the shade of the flowers, was threading jasmine blossoms with a needle. Baoyu watched Daiyu fishing for a while, then said a few words to Baochai with a laugh, after which he watched Xiren and the others eating crab and drank a few cups of wine with them. Xiren shelled some crab for him.\n\nPresently Daiyu put down her fishing-rod, went to the table and picked up the dark- patterned silver pot with a design of plum-blossom. She chose a small greenish-white stone cup in the shape of a plantain leaf. The maids, assuming she meant to drink, promptly came forward to pour for her.\n\n“You go on with your meal,” she said. “Let me help myself. That’s the fun of it.” She poured half a cup and found it was yellow rice wine.\n\n“I’ve eaten just a little crab,” she said, “and it’s given me a slight heartburn. I’d like to sip some hot spirits.”\n\n“There is some,” cried Baoyu promptly.\n\nHe ordered a pot of spirits heated, infused with petals of the hibiscus which made them fragrant. Daiyu took only a sip.\n\nShe put it down after one sip. Baochai came over then, picked up another cup and took a sip. Having moistened the brush she marked the first poem “In Memory of the Chrysanthemum” and added the character Heng below. Baoyu hastily intervened.\n\n“Dear cousin, I’ve already four lines for the second one. Do let me do that.”\n\n“I’ve only just managed to finish one, yet you’re in such a hurry.” She smiled.\n\nDaiyu said nothing but took the brush and marked the eighth poem “Chrysanthemums in Question,” then the eleventh “Chrysanthemums in Dream,” adding below the character Xiao. Baoyu took the brush then to mark the second poem “A Visit to the Chrysanthemums” and added the character Yi. Tanchun, who had come over to look, exclaimed:\n\n“What, no one has chosen ‘Chrysanthemums in the Hair’? I’ll do that.” She pointed a finger at Baoyu. “We’ve just agreed not to use any epithets suggesting boudoirs or maidens, so you’d better be careful.”\n\nJust then Xiangyun came up and marked the fourth and fifth poems “Chrysanthemums Adorned” and “Chrysanthemums Appreciated,” adding the character Xiang below.\n\n“You should choose a sobriquet too,” Tanchun told her.\n\n“Although our family has some fine lodges and pavilions,” said Xiangyun with a smile, “I don’t live in them; so it would be silly to borrow one of their names.”\n\n“Just now the old lady said that your family has a pavilion called the Pavilion of Rosy Cloud,” Baochai reminded her. “Isn’t that yours? Even if it no longer exists, you were the former owner.”\n\nThe others agreed that this was a good idea, and before Xiangyun could stop him Baoyu changed the character Xiang to Xia.\n\nIn less time than it would take to eat a meal all twelve poems were finished. Each was copied out and given to Yingchun, who made a clean copy on another sheet of snow-bark paper with the writer’s sobriquet appended to each poem. Li Wan and the rest then read out:\n\nIN MEMORY OF THE CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby Lady of the Alpinia\n\nThe west wind blows and I gaze sadly around,\n\nWhile smartweed reds and reed-cypress turn white;\n\nNo sign in deserted garden or empty plot,\n\nOnly cold moon and clear frost in dream have sight.\n\nMy heart follows the wild geese back south far away,\n\nAnd I sit lonely listening to evening’s washing block;\n\nWho pities me pining for the yellow blossom?\n\nBut the Ninth Festival will come, comfort me not.\n\nA VISIT TO THE CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby Happy Red Prince\n\nIn fine frosty weather, my leisure I take\n\nTo visit the flowers, no wine cup or medicine to keep me away.\n\nWho planted this before the frost under the moon?\n\nOutside the rails, by the fence, where does autumn stay?\n\nIn clogs I come from far, full of joy;\n\nChanting cold verses, my pleasure is complete.\n\nIf you flowers know the lover of verse,\n\nDo not disappoint this morning my cane’s support!\n\nPLANTING THE CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby Happy Red Prince\n\nI take a hoe and move them myself from the plot,\n\nPlanting them everywhere by the fence in front of the court;\n\nUnexpected rain last night revived them,\n\nThis morning they open, still with frost, to my joy.\n\nChanting of autumn beauty a thousand verses,\n\nTipsy with good wine, to cold fragrance I pour a libation;\n\nWith spring water I irrigate and with soil cover,\n\nWell to protect them from the world’s dust.\n\nCHRYSANTHEMUMS ADORNED\n\nby Old Friend of Rosy Cloud\n\nTransplanted from another plot, more precious than gold,\n\nOne shows light colour, another shows deep.\n\nBy the sparse fence, bare-headed, I sit,\n\nAnd in the clear fragrance, hugging my knees, I chant.\n\nOf all flowers you’re the one to disdain worldly show;\n\nIt seems that none but I your nature can tell.\n\nDo not miss the fleeting autumn days,\n\nBut facing each other let us treasure this time.\n\nCHRYSANTHEMUMS APPRECIATED\n\nby Old Friend of Rosy Cloud\n\nTo music and wine you are a fit companion,\n\nGracefully adorning the desk with your quiet charm.\n\nScent from the seat opposite wafts like dew from the path,\n\nLeaving my book I face an autumn spray.\n\nClear frost and paper screen bring fresh dreams;\n\nCold garden, setting sun, recall the past.\n\nWe scorn the world because we share the same taste,\n\nNot lingering like peach and plum in the spring wind.\n\nCHRYSANTHEMUMS IN SONG\n\nby Queen of Bamboos\n\nThe poetry fiend comes at dawn and dusk unseen,\n\nChanting by the fence, leaning on the stone, rapt alone.\n\nWith elegant verses I write of their purity in frost,\n\nAnd, mouth full of fragrance, chant to the moon.\n\nMy verses are filled with grief over virgin purity,\n\nBut who understands the complaint in my heart?\n\nEver since Tao Yuanming of old passed judgment,\n\nAfter that, their sublime strains have been praised to this day.\n\nPAINTING THE CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby Lady Alpinia\n\nWhat madness prompts me to wield my crazy brush after rhyming?\nNot to rival the art of some painter of renown,\nBut to show leaves massed together splashed with a thousand ink-dots,\nAnd flowers clustered one on another tinged with hoar-frost.\nTheir subtle charm is conjured up by my moving brush,\nAnd fragrance seems to emanate from my flowing wrist.\nDon’t mistake those on the fence for real ones plucked at random;\nI paint them to adorn my screen for the Double Ninth.\n\nQUESTIONING THE CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby River Queen\n\nNone else but you can tell of autumn’s tale;\nMusing alone, hands clasped, I ask the fence.\nWith your proud grace apart from all the crowd,\nWhat makes you bloom so late, the last to come?\nDoes dew in your garden plot, frost in your court\nBring loneliness? When wild geese come home, crickets chirp,\nDoes this fill you with longing? Say,\nThough all the world is dull, there’s none to talk with you,\nWhy not chat for a while with one who understands?\n\nWEARING CHRYSANTHEMUMS\n\nby The Stranger Under the Plantain\n\nEach day I’ve potted plants or set them by the fence;\nPlucked now, they should not be regarded as mere dress.\nThe young lord of Changan was by flowers obsessed;\nThe poet of Pengze was a drunkard, possessed.\nMy short hair is be-dewed from the garden’s three paths;\nMy coarse scarf stained with fragrance by autumn’s ninth frost.\nSuch noble taste is not for common people’s eyes —\nLet them point jeeringly at me here by the road.\n\nSHADOWS OF CHRYSANTHEMUMS\n\nby Old Friend by Awkward Fountain\n\nIn multiple, manifold shadows autumn’s splendour\nSteals imperceptibly into the garden.\nThe sparse lamp through the window outlines near and far;\nThe waning moon through the fence casts a checkered pattern.\nThe cold flower’s reflected spirit should stay;\nThe frost’s vivid imprint is an empty dream.\nTread carefully where dark fragrance is trampled — Who can distinguish the blurred shapes through bleared eyes?\n\nDREAM OF CHRYSANTHEMUMS\n\nby River Queen\n\nBy the fence autumn’s drowned in a refreshing sleep\nAs clouds drift past and the moon steals dimly away.\nNot like Zhuangzi, I dream of no butterfly;\nBut like the poet Tao Lin I recall old friends.\nIn sleep I yearn to follow the wild geese’s flight,\nBut am woken by the cicadas’ shrill complaint.\nTo whom can I complain of waking solitude?\nThe withered grass and misty night are full of grief!\n\nTHE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM\n\nby The Stranger Under the Plantain\n\nAs heavy frost congeals they gradually droop;\nThe feasting and enjoyment are barely over.\nTheir golden petals fade, leaving some fragrance;\nNo whole deep-green leaves remain on the boughs.\nHalf of the moonlight floods my bed, crickets chirp sadly;\nIn the vast cold sky the wild geese’s flight is slow.\nNext autumn we are sure to meet again —\nFor the time being, dear friends, let us not grieve at parting.\n\nAs the others read each poem they praised it, and all complimented each other.\n\n“Wait till I give my verdict,” said Li Wan with a smile. “On the whole, each of you has some good lines. But in my judgment, the first prize today goes to ‘Chanting the Chrysanthemum,’ the second to ‘Questioning the Chrysanthemum,’ and the third to ‘Dream of Chrysanthemums.’ The themes are original and the verses fine, with fresh ideas. So the River Queen should come first. After that, ‘Wearing Chrysanthemums,’ ‘Facing the Chrysanthemums,’ ‘Placing the Chrysanthemums,’ ‘Painting the Chrysanthemums’ and ‘Remembering the Chrysanthemums’ are the best.”\n\nBaoyu clapped his hands delightedly at this.\n\n“Quite right! Absolutely just!” he cried.\n\n“Mine aren’t up to much,” said Daiyu. “They’re rather too contrived.”\n\n“Well contrived, though. They don’t seem laboured.”\n\n“In my opinion,” said Daiyu, “the best line is ‘In cold garden, slanting sun, I recall old friends.’ That’s a fresh approach. And ‘Facing a spray of autumn, he lays aside his book’ is fine too. It says all there is to say about placing chrysanthemums, so then the poet goes back to the time before they were plucked. That’s profound.”\n\n“That’s true,” agreed Li Wan. “Still, your line ‘And from my mouth I let out fragrance’ can hold its own with those.”\n\n“I think Lady Allspice is more forceful,” put in Tanchun. “‘Autumn has left no trace’ and ‘only in dreams it’s known’ bring out the idea of remembrance.”\n\nBaochai smiled.\n\n“Your ‘short hair is be-dewed’ and ‘coarse scarf stained with fragrance’ give a perfect description of wearing chrysanthemums.”\n\nXiangyun remarked, “‘With whom do you hide’ and ‘why do you bloom so late’ certainly have the chrysanthemum stumped.”\n\n“Well, lines like ‘Sit bare-headed’ or ‘Chant, clasping my knees’ show that for the moment one can’t bear to part with the chrysanthemum,” said Li Wan. “If it had feelings, it would probably find this rather cloying.”\n\nThis set them all laughing.\n\n“I failed again,” she chuckled. “Could it be that ‘by whose fence,’ ‘where the frost,’ ‘from afar in clogs,’ and ‘endless cold chanting’ are not about visiting chrysanthemums? And that ‘last night’s rain’ and ‘this morning’s frost’ are not about planting them? Still, I must admit my lines can’t compare with ‘scent in the mouth chanting to the moon,’ ‘chanting, arms clasped round knees, in cool fragrance,’ ‘short hair,’ ‘coarse scarf,’ ‘pale gold,’ ‘emerald disorder,’ ‘autumn has no trace’ and ‘dream knows where.’” She added, “When I’m free tomorrow I’ll write a dozen on my own.”\n\n“Yours are good too,” said Li Wan. “They’re just not as fresh and original as those lines.”\n\nAfter further comments they asked for more hot crabs and sat down round the large round table to enjoy them.\n\nBaoyu remarked, “We should write some poems while eating crabs and enjoying the osmanthus. I’ve just made one. Who else will have a try?” He quickly washed his hands and, picking up a brush, wrote out his poem. It was as follows:\n\nGlad to eat crabs in osmanthus shade, we storm\n\nWith ginger minced and vinegar; of wine we’ve plenty.\n\nThe gluttonous prince might well have stayed away from home,\n\nBut the crusty customer has no contents in his belly.\n\nToo greedy to remember the belly’s chill,\n\nOur fingers washed, the smell of crabs clings on.\n\nTo please the palate, then, the gourmands kill;\n\nThe old immortal laughed: one’s whole life is soon gone. 1\n\n“You could write a hundred poems like that at one sitting,” teased Daiyu.\n\n“Well, your inspiration seems to have run out,” he retorted. “Instead of writing one yourself, you’re finding fault.”\n\nWithout a word she tossed her head, then with a smile, after a moment’s thought, she picked up her brush and wrote a poem which the others read:\n\nNot forgetting in death their armour and long spears,\n\nPiled on the plate they make us cry for joy.\n\nThe tender meat in double claws is full;\n\nThe rich red cream in shells smells very good.\n\nWe love the eight legs, though of meat there’s little;\n\nTo add zest who will urge me to drink a thousand cups?\n\nWe toast this fine fare in this fine season,\n\nBreezes fan osmanthus, frost spangles the chrysanthemums.\n\nBaoyu was loud in his praise, but Daiyu tore the poem up and told the servants to burn it.\n\n“Mine isn’t as good as yours, so I’ll burn it,” she said smiling. “Yours is very good — better than your last one about chrysanthemums. You should keep it to show people.”\n\n“I’ve managed to rough out a verse too,” put in Baochai. “It may not be up to much, but I’ll write it out for a laugh.” She did so, and the others read:\n\nWe sit, cups raised, by misty osmanthus and dryandra,\n\nAnd greedy mouths in Changan are longing for this festival.\n\nThe roads before your eyes run criss-cross without reason,\n\nWhile dark yellow and light in your inwards brew trouble.\n\nAt this point they exclaimed in wonder.\n\n“Well said!” cried Baoyu. “My poem should be burned too.”\n\nThey read on:\n\nTo wash down fishy smells we need some ale of chrysanthemums,\n\nTo prevent belly-ache we must have ginger hot.\n\nWhat good to it now, descended in the pot?\n\nAll that remains by the pool is the scent of grain.\n\nAfter reading this they agreed, “This is the best poem about crabs. Small subjects like this should carry a profound meaning, and only a real talent can write so well. Still, it’s a bit too biting a satire.”\n\nAs they were speaking they saw Pinger return to the Garden. To know what business had brought her back, read the next chapter."
