  "original": "话说贾琏、贾珍、贾蓉等三人商议，事事妥贴，至初二日，先将尤老娘和三姐儿送入新房。尤老娘看了一看，虽不似贾蓉口内之言，倒也十分齐备，母女二人，已算称了心愿。鲍二两口子见了，如一盆火儿，赶着尤老娘一口一声叫“老娘”，又或是“老太太”；赶着三姐儿叫“三姨儿”，或是“姨娘”。至次日五更天，一乘素轿，将二姐儿抬来，各色香烛纸马，并铺盖以及酒饭，早已预备得十分妥当。一时贾琏素服坐了小轿来了，拜过了天地，焚了纸马。那尤老娘见了二姐儿身上头上，焕然一新，不似在家模样，十分得意；搀入洞房。是夜贾琏和他颠鸾倒凤，百般恩爱，不消细说。\n　　那贾琏越看越爱，越瞧越喜，不知要怎么奉承这二姐儿才过得去，乃命鲍二等人不许提三说二，直以“奶奶”称之，自己也称“奶奶”，竟将凤姐一笔勾倒。有时回家，只说在东府有事。凤姐因知他和贾珍好，有事相商，也不疑心。家下人虽多，都也不管这些事。便有那游手好闲、专打听小事的人，也都去奉承贾琏，乘机讨些便宜，谁肯去露风？于是贾琏深感贾珍不尽。贾琏一月出十五两银子，做天天的供给。若不来时，他母女三人一处吃饭；若贾琏来，他夫妻二人一处吃，他母女就回房自吃。贾琏又将自己积年所有的体己，一并搬来给二姐儿收着，又将凤姐儿素日之为人行事，枕边衾里，尽情告诉了他，只等一死，便接他进来。二姐儿听着，自然是愿意的了。当下十来个人，倒也过起日子来，十分丰足。\n　　眼见已是两月光景，这日贾珍在铁槛寺做完佛事，晚间回家时，与他妹妹久别，竟要去探望探望。先命小厮去打听贾琏在与不在。小厮回来，说：“不在那里。”贾珍喜欢，将家人一概先遣回去，只留两个心腹小童牵马。一时，到了新房子里，已是掌灯时候，悄悄进去。两个小厮将马拴在园内，自往下房去听候。\n　　贾珍进来，屋里才点灯，先看过尤氏母女，然后二姐儿出来相见。贾珍见了二姐儿，满脸的笑容，一面吃茶，一面笑说：“我做的保山如何？要错过了，打着灯笼还没处寻。过日你姐姐还备礼来瞧你们呢。”说话之间，二姐儿已命人预备下酒馔，关起门来。都是一家人，原无避讳。那鲍二来请安，贾珍便说：“你还是个有良心的，所以二爷叫你来伏侍。日后自有大用你之处。不可在外头吃酒生事，我自然赏你。倘或这里短了什么，你二爷事多，那里人杂，你只管去回我。我们弟兄，不比别人。”鲍二答应道：“小的知道。若小的不尽心，除非不要这脑袋了。”贾珍笑着点头道：“要你知道就好。”\n　　当下四人一处吃酒。二姐儿此时恐怕贾琏一时走来，彼此不雅，吃了两钟酒便推故往那边去了。贾珍此时也无可奈何，只得看着二姐儿自去。剩下尤老娘和三姐儿相陪。那三姐儿虽向来也和贾珍偶有戏言，但不似他姐姐那样随和儿，所以贾珍虽有垂涎之意，却也不肯造次了，致讨没趣。况且尤老娘在旁边陪着，贾珍也不好意思太露轻薄。\n　　却说跟的两个小厮，都在厨下和鲍二饮酒，那鲍二的女人多姑娘儿上灶。忽见两个丫头也走了来，嘲笑要吃酒，鲍二因说：“姐儿们不在上头伏侍，也偷着来了，一时叫起来没人，又是事。”他女人骂道：“糊涂浑呛了的忘八，你撞丧那黄汤罢。撞丧醉了，夹着你的脑袋挺你的尸去。叫不叫与你什么相干？一应有我承当呢。风啊雨的，横竖淋不到你头上来。”这鲍二原因妻子之力，在贾琏前十分有脸；近日他女人越发在二姐儿跟前殷勤服侍，他便自己除赚钱吃酒之外，一概不管，一听他女人吩咐，百依百随。当下又吃了些，便去睡觉。这里他女人随着这些丫鬟小厮吃酒，又和那小厮们打牙撂嘴儿的玩笑，讨他们的喜欢，准备在贾珍前讨好儿。\n　　正在吃的高兴，忽听见扣门的声儿。鲍二的女人忙出来开门看时，见是贾琏下马，问有事无事。鲍二女人便悄悄的告诉他说：”大爷在这里西院里呢。”贾琏听了，便至卧房。见尤二姐和两个小丫头在房中呢，见他来了，脸上却有些讪讪的。贾琏反推不知，只命：“快命酒来。咱们吃两杯好睡觉，我今日乏了。”二姐儿忙忙陪笑，接衣捧茶，问长问短，贾琏喜的心痒难受。一时，鲍二的女人端上酒来，二人对饮，两个小丫头在地下伏侍。\n　　贾琏的心腹小童隆儿拴马去，瞧见有了一匹马，细瞧一瞧，知是贾珍的，心下会意，也来厨下。只见喜儿、寿儿两个正在那里坐着吃酒，见他来了，也都会意，笑道：“你这会子来的巧。我们因赶不上爷的马，恐怕犯夜，往这里来借个地方睡一夜。”隆儿便笑道：“我是二爷使我送月银的。交给了奶奶，我也不回去了。”鲍二的女人便道：“咱们这里有的是炕，为什么大家不睡呢？”喜儿便说：“我们吃多了，你来吃一钟。”隆儿才坐下，端起酒来，忽听马棚内闹将起来。原来二马同槽，不能相容，互蹄蹶起来。隆儿等慌的忙放下酒杯，出来喝住，另拴好了进来。鲍二的女人笑道：“好儿子们，就睡罢！我可去了。”三个拦着不肯叫走，又亲嘴摸乳，口里乱嘈了一回，才放他出去。这里喜儿喝了几杯，已是楞子眼了。隆儿、寿儿关了门，回头见喜儿直挺挺的躺在炕上，二人便推他说：“好兄弟，起来好生睡。只顾你一个人舒服，我们就苦了。”那喜儿便说道：“咱们今儿可要公公道道贴一炉子烧饼了。”隆儿、寿儿见他醉了，也不理他，吹了灯将就卧下了。\n　　二姐听见马闹，心下着实不安，只管用言语混乱贾琏。那贾琏吃了几杯，春兴发作，便命收了酒果，掩门宽衣。二姐只穿着大红小袄，散挽乌云，满脸春色，比白日更增了俏丽。贾琏搂着他笑道：“人人都说我们那夜叉婆俊，如今我看来，给你拾鞋也不要。”二姐儿道：“我虽标致，却没品行，看来倒是不标致的好。”贾琏忙说：“怎么说这个话？我不懂。”二姐滴泪说道：“你们拿我作糊涂人待，什么事我不知道？我如今和你作了两个月的夫妻，日子虽浅，我也知你不是糊涂人。我生是你的人，死是你的鬼，如今既做了夫妻，终身我靠你，岂敢瞒藏一个字：我算是有倚有靠了，将来我妹子怎么是个结果？据我看来，这个形景儿，也不是常策，要想长久的法儿才好。”贾琏听了，笑道：“你放心，我不是那拈酸吃醋的人。你前头的事，我也知道，你倒不用含糊着。如今你跟了我来，大哥跟前自然倒要拘起形迹来了。依我的主意，不如叫三姨儿也合大哥成了好事，彼此两无碍，索性大家吃个杂会汤。你想怎么样？”二姐一面拭泪，一面说道：“虽然你有这个好意，头一件，三妹妹脾气不好；第二件，也怕大爷脸上下不来。”贾琏道：“这个无妨。我这会子就过去，索性破了例就完了。”\n　　说着，乘着酒兴，便往西院中来。只见窗内灯烛辉煌。贾琏便推门进去，说：“大爷在这里呢，兄弟来请安。”贾珍听是贾琏的声音，唬了一跳，见贾琏进来，不觉羞惭满面。尤老娘也觉不好意思。贾琏笑道：“这有什么呢，咱们弟兄，从前是怎么样来？大哥为我操心，我粉身碎骨，感激不尽。大哥要多心，我倒不安了。从此，还求大哥照常才好，不然兄弟宁可绝后，再不敢到此处来了。”说着便要跪下。慌的贾珍连忙搀起来，只说：“兄弟怎么说，我无不领命。”贾琏忙命人：“看酒来，我和大哥吃两杯。”因又笑嘻嘻向三姐儿道：“三妹妹为什么不合大哥吃个双钟儿？我也敬一杯，给大哥合三妹妹道喜。”\n　　三姐儿听了这话，就跳起来，站在炕上，指着贾琏冷笑道：“你不用和我花马掉嘴的！咱们‘清水下杂面，你吃我看’。‘提着影戏人子上场儿，好歹别戳破这层纸儿’。你别糊涂油蒙了心，打量我们不知道你府上的事呢！这会子花了几个臭钱，你们哥儿俩，拿着我们姊妹两个权当粉头来取乐儿，你们就打错了算盘了。我也知道你那老婆太难缠。如今把我姐姐拐了来做了二房，‘偷来的锣鼓儿打不得’。我也要会会这凤奶奶去，看他是几个脑袋？几只手？若大家好取和儿便罢，倘若有一点叫人过不去，我有本事先把你两个的牛黄狗宝掏出来，再和那泼妇拼了这条命！喝酒怕什么？咱们就喝。”说着自己拿起壶来，斟了一杯，自己先喝了半盏，揪过贾琏来就灌，说：“我倒没有和你哥哥喝过。今儿倒要和你喝一喝，咱们也亲近亲近。”吓的贾琏酒都醒了。贾珍也不承望三姐儿这等拉的下脸来。兄弟两个本是风流场中耍惯的，不想今日反被这个女孩儿一席话说的不能搭言。三姐看了这样，越发一叠声又叫：“将姐姐请来！要乐，咱们四个大家一处乐。俗语说的，‘便宜不过当家’，你们是哥哥兄弟，我们是姐姐妹妹，又不是外人，只管上来！”尤老娘方不好意思起来。贾珍得便就要溜，三姐儿那里肯放？贾珍此时反后悔，不承望他是这种人，与贾琏反不好轻薄了。\n　　只见这三姐索性卸了妆饰，脱了大衣服，松松的挽个儿，身上穿着大红小袄，半掩半开的，故意露出葱绿抹胸，一痕雪脯，底下绿裤红鞋，鲜艳夺目。忽起忽坐，忽喜忽嗔，没半刻斯文，两个坠子就和打秋千一般。灯光之下，越显得柳眉笼翠，檀口含丹，本是一双秋水眼，再吃了几杯酒，越发横波入鬓，转盼流光，真把那贾珍二人弄的欲近不能，欲远不舍，迷离恍惚，落魄垂涎。再加方才一席话，直将二人禁住。弟兄两个竟全然无一点儿能为，别说调情斗口齿，竟连一句响亮话都没了。三姐自己高谈阔论，任意挥霍，村俗流言，洒落一阵，由着性儿拿他弟兄二人嘲笑取乐。一时，他的酒足兴尽，更不容他弟兄多坐，竟撵出去了，自己关门睡去了。\n　　自此后，或略有丫鬟婆子不到之处，便将贾珍、贾琏、贾蓉三个厉言痛骂，说他爷儿三个诓骗他寡妇孤女。贾珍回去之后，也不敢轻易再来。那三姐儿有时高兴，又命小厮来找。及至到了这里，也只好随他的便，干瞅着罢了。看官听说：这尤三姐天生脾气，和人异样诡僻。只因他的模样儿风流标致，他又偏爱打扮的出色，另式另样，做出许多万人不及的风情体态来。那些男子们，别说贾珍、贾琏这样风流公子，便是一班老到人，铁石心肠，看见了这般光景，也要动心的。及至到他跟前，他那一种轻狂豪爽、目中无人的光景，早又把人的一团高兴逼住，不敢动手动脚。所以贾珍向来和二姐儿无所不至，渐渐的俗了，却一心注定在三姐儿身上，便把二姐儿乐得让给贾琏，自己却和三姐儿捏合。偏那三姐一般合他玩笑，别有一种令人不敢招惹的光景。他母亲和二姐儿也曾十分相劝，他反说：“姐姐糊涂！咱们金玉一般的人，白叫这两个现世宝沾污了去，也算无能。而且他家现放着个极利害的女人，如今瞒着，自然是好的，倘或一日他知道了，岂肯干休？势必有一场大闹。你二人不知谁生谁死，这如何便当作安身乐业的去处？”他母女听他这话，料着难劝，也只得罢了。那三姐儿天天挑拣穿吃，打了银的，又要金的；有了珠子，又要宝石；吃着肥鹅，又宰肥鸭。或不趁心，连桌一推，衣裳不如意，不论绫缎新整，便用剪子铰碎，撕一条，骂一句。究竟贾珍等何曾随意了一日，反花了许多昧心钱。\n　　贾琏来了，只在二姐屋里，心中也渐渐的悔上来了。无奈二姐儿倒是个多情的人，以为贾琏是终身之主了，凡事倒还知疼着热。要论温柔和顺，却较着凤姐还有些体度，就论起那标致来，及言谈行事，也不减于凤姐。但已经失了脚，有了一个“淫”字，凭他什么好处也不算了。偏这贾琏又说：“谁人无错？知过必改就好。”故不提已往之淫，只取现今之善。便如胶似漆，一心一计，誓同生死，那里还有凤、平二人在意了。二姐在枕边衾内，也常劝贾琏说：“你和珍大爷商议商议，拣个相熟的，把三丫头聘了罢。留着他不是常法儿，终久要生事的。”贾琏道：“前日我也曾回大哥的，他只是舍不的。我还说：‘就是块肥羊肉，无奈烫的慌！玫瑰花儿可爱，刺多扎手。咱们未必降的住，正经拣个人聘了罢。’他只意意思思的就撂过手了，你叫我有什么法儿？”二姐儿道：“你放心。咱们明儿先劝三丫头，问准了，让他自己闹去，闹的无法，少不得聘他。”贾琏听了，说：“这话极是。”\n　　至次日，二姐儿另备了酒，贾琏也不出门，至午间，特请他妹妹过来和他母亲上坐。三姐儿便知其意，刚斟上酒，也不用他姐姐开口，便先滴泪说道：“姐姐今儿请我，自然有一番大道理要说。但只我也不是糊涂人，也不用絮絮叨叨的。从前的事，我已尽知了，说也无益。既如今姐姐也得了好处安身，妈妈也有了安身之处，我也要自寻归结去，才是正礼。但终身大事，一生至一死，非同儿戏。向来人家看着咱们娘儿们微息，不知都安着什么心，我所以破着没脸，人家才不敢欺负。这如今要办正事，不是我女孩儿家没羞耻，必得我拣个素日可心如意的人，才跟他。要凭你们选择，虽是有钱有势的，我心里进不去，白过了这一世了。”贾琏笑道：“这也容易。凭你说是谁，就是谁。一应彩礼，都有我们置办，母亲也不用操心。”三姐儿道：“姐姐横竖知道，不用我说。”贾琏笑问二姐儿是谁，二姐儿一时想不起来。贾琏料定必是此人无移了，便拍手笑道：“我知道这人了，果然好眼力。”二姐儿笑道：“是谁？”贾琏笑道：“别人他如何进得去？一定是宝玉。”二姐儿与尤老娘听了，也以为必然是宝玉了。三姐儿便啐了一口，说：“我们有姐妹十个，也嫁你弟兄十个不成？难道除了你家，天下就没有好男人了不成？”众人听了都诧异：“除了他，还有那一个？”三姐儿道：“别只在眼前想，姐姐只在五年前想，就是了。”\n　　正说着，忽见贾琏的心腹小厮兴儿走来请贾琏，说：“老爷那边紧等着叫爷呢。小的答应往舅老爷那边去了，小的连忙来请。”贾琏又忙问：“昨日家里问我来着么？”兴儿说：“小的回奶奶：爷在家庙里和珍大爷商议做百日的事，只怕不能来。”贾琏忙命拉马，隆儿跟随去了，留下兴儿答应人。尤二姐便要了两碟菜来，命拿大杯斟了酒，就命兴儿在炕沿下站着喝，一长一短，向他说话儿。问道：“家里奶奶多大年纪？怎么个利害的样子？老太太多大年纪？姑娘几个？”各样家常等话。\n　　兴儿笑嘻嘻的，在炕沿下，一头喝，一头将荣府之事备细告诉他母女。又说：“我是二门上该班的人。我们共是两班，一班四个，共是八个人。有几个知奶奶的心腹，有几个知爷的心腹。奶奶的心腹，我们不敢惹；爷的心腹，奶奶敢惹。提起来，我们奶奶事，告诉不得奶奶！他心里歹毒，口里尖快。我们二爷也算是个好的，那里见的他？倒是跟前有个平姑娘，为人很好，虽然和奶奶一气，他倒背着奶奶常作些好事。我们有了不是，奶奶是容不过的，只求求他去就完了。如今合家大小，除了老太太、太太两个，没有不恨他的，只不过面子情儿怕他。皆因他一时看得人都不及他，只一味哄着老太太、太太两个人喜欢。他说一是一，说二是二，没人敢拦他。又恨不的把银子钱省下来，堆成山，好叫老太太、太太说他会过日子。殊不知苦了下人，他讨好儿。或有好事，他就不等别人去说，他先抓尖儿。或有不好的事，或他自己错了，他就一缩头，推到别人身上去，他还在旁边拨火儿。如今连他正经婆婆都嫌他，说他：‘雀儿拣着旺处飞’，‘黑母鸡——一窝儿’，自家的事不管，倒替人家去瞎张罗。要不是老太太在头里，早叫过他去了。”尤二姐笑道：“你背着他这么说他，将来背着我还不知怎么说我呢。我又差他一层儿了，越发有的说了。”兴儿忙跪下说道：“奶奶要这么说，小的不怕雷劈吗？但凡小的要有造化，起先娶奶奶时，要得了这样的人，小的们也少挨些打骂，也少提心吊胆的。如今跟爷的几个人，谁不是背前背后称扬奶奶盛德怜下？我们商量着叫二爷要出来，情愿来伺候奶奶呢。”\n　　尤二姐笑道：“你这小猾贼儿还不起来。说句玩话儿，就吓的这样儿。你们做什么往这里来？我还要找了你奶奶去呢。”兴儿连忙摇手，说：“奶奶千万别去！我告诉奶奶：一辈子不见他才好呢。‘嘴甜心苦，两面三刀’，‘上头笑着，脚底下就使绊子’，‘明是一盆火，暗是一把刀’：他都占全了。只怕三姨儿这张嘴还说不过他呢，奶奶这么斯文良善人，那里是他的对手？”二姐笑道：“我只以理待他，他敢怎么着我？”兴儿道：“不是小的喝了酒放肆胡说，奶奶就是让着他，他看见奶奶比他标致，又比他得人心儿，他就肯善罢干休了？人家是醋罐子，他是醋缸，醋瓮。凡丫头们跟前，二爷多看一眼，他有本事当着爷打个烂羊头似的。虽然平姑娘在屋里，大约一年里头，两个有一次在一处，他还要嘴里掂十来个过儿呢。气的平姑娘性子上来，哭闹一阵，说：‘又不是我自己寻来的！你逼着我，我不愿意，又说我反了；这会子又这么着。’他一般也罢了，倒央及平姑娘。”二姐笑道：“可是撒谎？这么一个夜叉，怎么反怕屋里的人呢？”兴儿道：“就是俗语说的，‘三人抬不过个理字去’了。这平姑娘原是他自幼儿的丫头。陪过来一共四个，死的死，嫁的嫁，只剩下这个心爱的，收在房里，一则显他贤良，二则又拴爷的心。那平姑娘又是个正经人，从不会挑三窝四的，倒一味忠心赤胆伏侍他，所以才容下了。”\n　　二姐笑道：“原来如此。但只我听见你们还有一位寡妇奶奶和几位姑娘，他这么利害，这些人肯依他吗？”兴儿拍手笑道：“原来奶奶不知道。我们家这位寡妇奶奶，第一个善德人，从不管事，只教姑娘们看书写字，针线道理，这是他的事情。前儿因为他病了，这大奶奶暂管了几天事，总是按着老例儿行，不象他那么多事逞才的。我们大姑娘，不用说，是好的了。二姑娘混名儿叫‘二木头’。三姑娘的混名儿叫‘玫瑰花儿’：又红又香，无人不爱，只是有刺扎手。可惜不是太太养的，‘老鸹窝里出凤凰’。四姑娘小，正经是珍大爷的亲妹子，太太抱过来的，养了这么大，也是一位不管事的。奶奶不知道：我们家的姑娘们不算，外还有两位姑娘，真是天下少有。一位是我们姑太太的女儿，姓林；一位是姨太太的女儿，姓薛：这两位姑娘都是美人一般的呢，又都知书识字的。或出门上车，或在园子里遇见，我们连气儿也不敢出。”尤二姐笑道：“你们家规矩大，小孩子进的去，遇见姑娘们，原该远远的藏躲着，敢出什么气儿呢。”兴儿摇手，道：“不是那么不敢出气儿。是怕这气儿大了，吹倒了林姑娘；气儿暖了，又吹化了薛姑娘。”说得满屋里都笑了。\n　　要知尤三姐要嫁何人，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jia Lian, Jia Zhen and Jia Rong having settled everything to their satisfaction, on the second of the month they had the old woman and Third Sister escorted to the new house. The old woman saw that although it did not quite come up to Jia Rong’s description, it was well furnished and she and her daughters were content. And the Pao family, full of zeal, kept addressing her as “Old Lady” or “Lady,” and Third Sister as “Third Sister” or “Miss.”\n\nThe next day at dawn a plain sedan-chair arrived to fetch Second Sister. Incense, candles, paper horses, bedding, food and wine had all been prepared. Presently Jia Lian, in undress costume, arrived by sedan-chair. He bowed to Heaven and Earth and burned paper horses. The old woman was delighted to see how smart Second Sister looked now in her new clothes and headdress, so different from at home. She helped the young couple into the bridal chamber, and that night their lovemaking was of the most ardent and affectionate nature — we need not go into details.\n\nJia Lian was so enraptured with Second Sister that he could not do enough to please her. He ordered Pao Er and the others not to refer to her as Second Sister but to call her “Mistress,” and he himself called her “Mistress,” ignoring Xifeng’s very existence. When he went home he said that he had business to attend to in the other mansion. And as Xifeng knew that he was on good terms with Jia Zhen and had matters to discuss with him, she suspected nothing. The servants, although they knew what was going on, had no wish to interfere. Those idlers who pried into other people’s affairs and made trouble tried to curry favour with Jia Lian in the hope of gaining some advantage, so who would spread rumours? Jia Lian was therefore very grateful to Jia Zhen. He provided fifteen taels a month for their daily expenses, and when he was not there the three women had their meals together; when he came, he ate with Second Sister while the mother and Third Sister retired to their own rooms. He also handed over to Second Sister all his private savings, and confided to her Xifeng’s faults as well as his intention to install Second Sister in her place after her death. Naturally Second Sister was only too pleased. And so the dozen or so of them lived in considerable comfort.\n\nTwo months passed. One day, on his way back after Buddhist mass in the Iron Threshold Temple, Jia Zhen who had not seen his sister for so long decided to call on her. He sent a servant first to find out whether Jia Lian was there or not.\n\nLearning that he was not at home, Jia Zhen in high spirits sent the rest of his attendants back, keeping only two trusted pages to lead his horse. He reached the house at lamp-lighting time and went in quietly. The two pages tethered the horses in the stable and waited in the servants’ quarters.\n\nJia Zhen went into the lighted room and after greeting the old woman and Third Sister, Second Sister came out to welcome him. He beamed at the sight of her.\n\n“What do you think of me as a match-maker?” he asked, sipping tea. “If you’d let such a chance slip, you could search everywhere with a lantern and never find another. One of these days your sister means to call with presents to congratulate you.”\n\nMeanwhile Second Sister had ordered a feast to be prepared, and now the door was closed. Since they were one family there was no need to stand on ceremony. When Pao Er came to pay his respects, Jia Zhen said:\n\n“You’re a good fellow, that’s why the Second Master put you here to serve. Later on we’ll see about promoting you. Don’t get into trouble outside through drinking. If you do well, you can count on a reward. If you find anything lacking here, don’t go to the Second Master about it; he has plenty of other business and there are too many people in his house who might talk. Just come and report to me. We brothers don’t stand on ceremony.”\n\n“I understand, sir,” said Pao Er. “Unless I do my best, may I lose my head.”\n\nJia Zhen nodded, smiling.\n\n“That’s the way to talk.”\n\nThen the four of them drank together.\n\nFearing that Jia Lian might come back and find them together, Second Sister after a couple of cups made some excuse to leave. Jia Zhen had to let her go. This left only old Mrs. You and Third Sister to keep him company. Although Third Sister had occasionally joked with him in the past, she was not as easy-going as her sister, and much as he lusted after her he was afraid of making a fool of himself; besides, with her mother there he could not be too shameless.\n\nJia Zhen’s two pages, who had accompanied him, were drinking in the kitchen with Bao Er, whose wife Duo Guniang was cooking. When two maids came in too, bantering and demanding wine, Bao Er said:\n\n“Why aren’t you girls waiting on the mistresses up there? Playing truant, eh? If you’re called for and no one’s there, there’ll be trouble.”\n\n“You stupid, addled turtle!” swore his wife. “Go on, swill your yellow soup. Swill yourself silly, then pillow your head on your prick and sleep it off. What business is it of yours if they’re called or not? I’ll take the blame if anything happens. Rain or wind, you won’t get wet.”\n\nBao Er owed his good job with Jia Lian to his wife. And now that she was working so hard to please Second Sister, he left everything to her apart from drawing his pay and drinking, always doing whatever she told him. So after a little more drinking he went off to bed. His wife stayed drinking with the maids and pages, joking with the boys and teasing them to keep them in a good humour so that they would put in a good word for her with Jia Zhen.\n\nThey were enjoying themselves when there came a knock on the gate. Bao Er’s wife hurried out to open it and saw that Jia Lian had dismounted. When he asked if all was well, she whispered, “The Elder Master is in the west courtyard.”\n\nOn hearing this Jia Lian went to the bedroom. He found Second Sister there with two maids. She looked rather embarrassed at his arrival, but he pretended not to notice and simply said, “Bring some wine. We’ll have a couple of cups before turning in. I’m tired today.”\n\nSecond Sister smilingly helped him off with his outdoor clothes, offered him tea and asked him a few questions, till he was itching with desire. Soon Bao Er’s wife brought in the wine and they drank together, the two maids waiting on them.\n\nJia Lian’s page Long-er, having stabled his master’s horse, noticed another horse there and realized to whom it belonged. He made his way to the kitchen, where he found Xi-er and Shou-er sitting drinking. They understood each other without any explanation.\n\n“You’ve come at the right time,” they told him. “As we couldn’t keep up with our master’s horse and were afraid of breaking the curfew, we’ve come here to beg a bed for the night.”\n\n“The Second Master sent me to bring the monthly allowance,” said Long-er. “I’ve given it to the mistress, so I’m not going back either.”\n\n“There’s room on the kang for all of us,” said Bao Er’s wife. “Why not turn in?”\n\n“We’ve had a drop too much,” said Xi-er. “Come and have a cup.”\n\nLong-er had just sat down and taken up his cup when a commotion broke out in the stable. The two horses, being in the same stall, had started kicking each other. The three pages put down their cups and rushed out to quiet them, then tethered them separately before returning to the kitchen.\n\n“Go to bed now, my fine sons,” said Bao Er’s wife. “I’m off.”\n\nThey tried to detain her, kissing her and fondling her breasts, and it was some time before they let her go. By now Xi-er was tipsy. When Long-er and Shou-er had closed the door and turned round, they saw him stretched out flat on the kang.\n\n“Get up, brother, and make yourself comfortable,” they said, shaking him.\n\n\"How miserable!\" Then Xi’er said, \"We must be fair and square today and bake a pan of cakes.\"\n\nSeeing that he was drunk, Long’er and Shou’er ignored him, blew out the lamp and lay down to sleep.\n\nThe commotion outside made Second Sister most uneasy, and she tried to distract Jia Lian with small talk. He had had a few cups of wine and now felt amorous. He ordered the remains of the feast to be cleared away, the door closed and his outer garments removed. Second Sister in her red jacket, with her glossy black hair down and her cheeks flushed, looked even more lovely than by daylight. He hugged her and said with a smile:\n\n\"Everyone says my shrew is beautiful, but to my mind she’s not fit to hold your shoes.\"\n\n\"I may be good-looking but I’ve no sense of propriety,\" she rejoined. \"Maybe it’s better not to be.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I don’t understand.\"\n\nWith tears in her eyes she said, \"You may think me a fool, but there’s nothing I don’t know. Though we’ve only been married two months, I can see you’re no fool either. Alive I’m yours, dead your ghost. Now that I’m your wife I shall depend on you all my life; how dare I hide anything from you? I’m provided for, but what’s to become of my younger sister? It seems to me this can’t go on for long. We must think of some more permanent way out.\"\n\n\"Set your mind at rest,\" he said. \"I’m not the jealous type. I know all about your past, you’ve no need to be so discreet. Now that you’re mine, of course you have to keep up appearances with my elder cousin. My idea is that Third Sister should become his wife too; then neither will be in the other’s way and we can all have a good time together. What do you say to that?\"\n\nWiping her eyes she answered, \"It’s good of you to suggest it, but in the first place she’s so headstrong, and in the second I’m afraid the master may feel embarrassed.\"\n\n\"That doesn’t matter. I’ll go over now and break the ice for them.\"\n\nSo, fired by wine, he went to the western court. Seeing lights behind the window, he pushed open the door and went in.\n\n\"So you’re here, brother,\" he said. \"I’ve come to pay my respects.\"\n\nJia Zhen, recognizing his voice, was consternated. And when Jia Lian walked in he blushed for shame, as did old Mrs. You.\n\n\"What’s there to be afraid of?\" asked Jia Lian cheerfully. \"We’re brothers, aren’t we? I can never thank you enough for all the trouble you’ve taken on my account, brother. If you feel embarrassed, that makes me uncomfortable. I hope you’ll go on looking after me as before. Otherwise, I’d rather have no son than presume any more on your kindness.\" He made as if to kneel down.\n\nIn confusion Jia Zhen helped him up, saying, \"Don’t talk like that, brother. I’ll do whatever you say.\"\n\nJia Lian ordered a servant to bring wine. \"I’ll drink a few cups with my brother,\" he said. Then, beaming, he turned to Third Sister. \"Why don’t you drink a cup with our elder brother, third sister? Let me offer a toast to congratulate you both.\"\n\nThird Sister jumped up at that and stepped on to the kang.\n\n\"Don’t try to get round me with your glib talk!\" she cried, pointing one finger at him. \"Let’s be open as day, and no hanky-panky. Don’t put on a shadow-play and pretend not to see through the screen. Don’t be such a muddle-headed fool as to think we don’t know all about your fine family. Just because you’ve spent a few stinking coins, you and your brother think you can buy us to amuse you like a couple of prostitutes. You’ve miscarculated. I know what a termagant your wife is. Now you’ve inveigled my sister here to be your second wife; but a stolen drum isn’t one you can beat.\"\n\nI’ve a good mind to have it out with that whore Xifeng and see how many heads and hands she has. If she’ll be reasonable, well and good. If she makes the least trouble, I’ll tear out your livers first, then have it out with that bitch even if it costs me my life. What do I care about drinking? Let’s drink.”\n\nShe picked up the kettle, filled a cup and drank half of it herself; then, seizing hold of Jia Lian, she forced him to drink the rest.\n\n“I’ve never drunk with your cousin,” she said. “But I’ll drink with you today so that we can get to know each other better.”\n\nThis sobered Jia Lian with fright. And Jia Zhen had never expected Third Sister to be so brazen. The two cousins, used to fooling around with women, were now tongue-tied by this girl.\n\n“Fetch my sister here!” she cried. “If we want to have fun, let’s all four have fun together. As the proverb says, ‘The best bargain is when one of the family benefits.’ You’re brothers, we’re sisters — we’re all one family, none of us are outsiders. Come on, don’t hang back!”\n\nMadam You was quite embarrassed by now, and Jia Zhen was looking for a chance to slip away; but Third Sister would not let him go. He regretted now having come, for this was not the way he and Jia Lian had meant to fool around with her.\n\nThird Sister, having taken off her ornaments and outer clothes, was in a scarlet jacket which she wore open to show her leek-green stomacher and a glimpse of white breast. Below you could see her green trousers and red slippers. Her eyes sparkled, whether she was coming or going, smiling or annoyed. There was nothing demure about her. Her ear-rings swung wildly as she moved. In the lamplight her eyebrows looked as black as if painted, her lips were red without rouge, and her liquid eyes, now that she was a little drunk, seemed even more alluring, shooting out rays which shot through the hearts of Jia Zhen and Jia Lian. Transfixed, they would have liked to approach her but dared not, would have liked to leave but could not tear themselves away. And her tirade had so cowed them that they had lost all power of repartee, even of coherent speech. She, however, talked away volubly, airing all the vulgar gossip she knew and making fun of the two cousins to amuse herself. Then, having drunk her fill and enjoyed herself enough, she chased them away — she did not even let them stay any longer — and having seen them out, bolted the door and went to bed.\n\nAfter this, if any maid or serving-woman failed to wait on them properly, she would roundly abuse Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong, accusing the three of them of swindling a widow and her fatherless daughters. Jia Zhen did not dare to visit them again unless he was sent for by Third Sister when she was in the mood; and then he had to let her have her way, not venturing to lay a finger on her.\n\nNow, readers, Third Sister had a most extraordinary, eccentric character. Because she was so good-looking and loved to dress strikingly in a style all her own, she had a coquettish appeal which few could equal. Not to speak of profligates like Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, even men of steady principles and iron self-control would have been fascinated at the sight of her. But once in her presence, her shocking audacity and the way she ignored them would damp their ardour and deter them from any familiarities. Jia Zhen, who had had his will of Second Sister and gradually tired of her, had set his heart on Third Sister. He was only too glad to turn Second Sister over to Jia Lian in the hope of getting on intimate terms with Third Sister; but though she joked with him too, she had a way of keeping him at arm’s length.\n\nHer mother and Second Sister had often urged her to be more amenable.\n\n“How silly you are!” she retorted. “We’re as good as gold and jade...”\n\nIt would be too bad to let those two wretches defile her — that would prove me incompetent too. Besides, their family has a real termagant. If we keep this from her for the time being, well and good; but if she finds out one day there’ll be the devil to pay. You two don’t know which of you will come out alive. So how can you look on this as a safe refuge?” Realizing from this that it would be hard to dissuade her, mother and daughter had to let the matter drop.\n\nThird Sister gave way to extravagance, demanding silver one day and gold the next, pearls one day and gems the next; she would eat fat goose and then fat duck. If she was out of temper she pushed over the table; if her clothes displeased her she would cut good new satin or silk to shreds, tearing it strip by strip and cursing as she did so. In fact, far from having their way with her, Jia Zhen and the others had to spend much ill-gotten money on her.\n\nJia Lian spent all his time in Second Sister’s rooms and was beginning to repent of this marriage. However, she was a loving woman who regarded him as the man of her destiny and showed him every tenderness. She was more gentle and considerate than Xifeng, while for charm, speech and behaviour she was Xifeng’s equal. But having stumbled once, the label “loose” stuck to her and nothing could whitewash her. Besides, Jia Lian had said, “Who doesn’t make mistakes? So long as she mends her ways, that’s all right.” So he overlooked her past and appreciated her present goodness. They became as close as glue and lacquer, one at heart, swearing to live and die together, with no thought for Xifeng or Pinger.\n\nIn bed, Second Sister often urged him, “Have a talk with Master Zhen and find some family we know to arrange a match for Third Sister. It’s not safe to keep her here; sooner or later there’s bound to be trouble.”\n\n“I did mention it to him the other day,” Jia Lian replied. “But he can’t bear to part with her. I said, ‘That piece of fat mutton’s too hot to eat. A lovely rose like that is hard to pluck. We may not be able to handle her. We’d better find her a husband.’ But he hemmed and hawed and dropped the subject. What can I do?”\n\n“Don’t worry,” said Second Sister. “Tomorrow we’ll sound Third Sister out. Once she agrees, we can leave it to her to raise such a rumpus that they’ll have to marry her off.”\n\n“Good idea,” agreed Jia Lian.\n\nThe next day, Second Sister prepared a feast. As Jia Lian did not go out, at noon she invited her sister over and made her mother take the seat of honour. Third Sister, knowing what was in the wind, had hardly any wine poured out before she said with tears:\n\n“I know you’ve something very important to say to me today, sister. But I’m not a fool and there’s no need to beat about the bush. I know all about the past, and talking of it won’t help. Now that you’ve found a snug berth and mother has a home too, it’s only right that I should be thinking of my future. But marriage is a serious step — it’s for life — not a joking matter. People have always looked down on us, and who knows what ideas they may have? I had to brazen it out to stop them from bullying me. Now that it’s time to think of my future, I don’t care if people think me shameless: I must choose someone I really care for. If I leave the choice to you, even if you pick a rich and powerful man, if I can’t stand him I shall feel all my life that I’ve thrown myself away.”\n\nJia Lian laughed. “That’s easy. Just say who you want. We’ll provide all the betrothal gifts and your mother needn’t worry.”\n\n“My sister knows, I needn’t say.”\n\nJia Lian asked Second Sister who it was, but she could not think. Sure that there must be such a person, he clapped his hands.\n\n“I know!” he cried. “It must be him of course. He’s a good fellow, and he’s suited to her too.”\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Jia Lian.\n\nSecond Sister laughed. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Who else could get in but Baoyu?\"\n\nShe and her mother were convinced that it must have been him.\n\nThird Sister spat in disgust. \"Are we ten sisters to be married to your ten brothers? Are there no good men outside your family?\"\n\nThe others were surprised. \"Who else could it be?\"\n\n\"Don't just think of the present,\" she retorted. \"Let sister think back five years.\"\n\nAs they were talking, Jia Lian's trusted servant Xing'er came in.\n\n\"The master's waiting for you, sir,\" he announced. \"I said you'd gone to your uncle's, then came to fetch you.\"\n\n\"Did they ask for me at home yesterday?\"\n\n\"I told the mistress you'd gone to the family temple to discuss the mourning ceremonies for a hundred days with Master Zhen, and might not be back.\"\n\nJia Lian ordered his horse to be saddled and left with Long'er, while Xing'er stayed behind in charge. Second Sister sent for two dishes of food and a large cup, and told Xing'er to stand below the kang and drink while she chatted with him, asking him all sorts of questions about the Jia household: How old was the mistress? How was she so formidable? How old was the old lady? How many young ladies were there?\n\nBeaming, Xing'er standing by the kang drank and gave them a detailed description of the Rong Mansion.\n\n\"I'm on duty at the inner gate,\" he said. \"There are two shifts of us, four to a shift — eight altogether. Some of the mistress' trusted servants are there, and some of the master's. We daren't offend her minions; but he doesn't dare offend his. Our mistress' doings are really something! She has a malicious heart and a sharp tongue. Even the master can't stand up to her, good man though he is. But there's Miss Ping who's very kind. Although she's on the mistress' side, she often does good behind her back. If any of us get into trouble and the mistress won't forgive us, we just beg Miss Ping to put in a word for us, and then it's all right. Everyone high and low apart from the old lady and Lady Wang detests our mistress, they just put up with her for form's sake. Because she looks down on everyone and only curries favour with the old lady and Her Ladyship. Whatever she says goes, and no one dares stop her. She'd save every cent to build up a mountain of silver, just to make them say she's a good manager. She doesn't care how we servants suffer, so long as she gets the credit. If anything good turns up, she pushes to the front. If something bad happens or she makes some mistake, she backs away and shifts the blame on to other people; in fact, she even fans the fire. Now even her own mother-in-law can't stand her, and calls her a sparrow flying to a prosperous house and a black hen laying eggs in other hens' nests — she doesn't look after her own affairs but bustles about managing other people's business. If not for the old lady, the master would have sent her packing long ago.\"\n\nSecond Sister smiled. \"You run her down behind her back. Who knows what you'll say about me later when my back is turned. I'm not her equal, so you'll have even more to say.\"\n\nXing'er fell on his knees. \"Don't talk like that, madam, or may lightning strike me!\" he cried. \"If we'd had the luck to have a mistress like you when first the master married, we'd have been spared many beatings and curses, and we wouldn't have to live in fear and trembling. All the master's servants now, behind your back, can't find words to praise your kindheartedness to your inferiors. We've been meaning to beg the master to let us come and serve you, madam.\"\n\n“You little rascal,” said Second Sister with a laugh. “Get up. Can’t you take a joke? Fancy being so scared. What are you doing here? I was just going to see your mistress.”\n\nXinger hastily waved his hands in protest. “Don’t go, madam, whatever you do. Take my advice and steer clear of her all your life. ‘Honey-mouthed but dagger-hearted,’ ‘double-faced and double-tongued,’ ‘a smile on her face but a knife up her sleeve’ — she’s all that. Even your sharp-tongued sister is no match for her, so how can a gentle, kind lady like you hope to stand up to her?”\n\n“I shall appeal to her reason,” said Second Sister. “What can she do to me?”\n\n“It’s not the drink that’s making me talk so wildly, madam, but even if you were to give in to her, the fact that you’re better-looking and more popular would make her leave you alone? If other people are jealous, she’s a hundred times worse. If the master so much as glances at one of the maids, she can beat the girl black and blue in front of him. Although Miss Ping is his concubine, they’re only together once a year or so, and then she nags about it at least ten times. This has made Miss Ping so angry, she once stormed and sobbed, ‘It wasn’t my idea. You forced me into it against my will, and now you’re complaining. If I protest you accuse me of rebelling; and now you carry on like this.’ Yet in the end she usually gives in and has to coax Miss Ping.”\n\n“You’re making this up, surely. How could a fury like that be afraid of her maid?”\n\n“As the proverb says, ‘The reasonable man rules.’ Besides, Miss Ping was her maid from childhood. She brought four girls here with her at the time of her marriage. Two died and one left after marrying, leaving just her favourite whom she made the master’s concubine. This made her appear virtuous, and at the same time it tied him to her. And Miss Ping is a good sort, not one to make trouble; she serves her mistress loyalty, so she puts up with her.”\n\n“I see. But I’ve heard you have a widow as well as several young ladies in your household. If she’s so horrid, how do they get on with her?”\n\nXinger clapped his hands and chuckled.\n\n“So you don’t know that, madam. Our widowed mistress is the kindest person, she never interferes in anything but just teaches the young ladies to read, write and sew. That’s her whole life. The other day, because our mistress was ill, she took over the running of the household for a few days; but she always stuck to the old rules, not like our mistress who’s so interfering and pushing. Our eldest young lady was a really good sort, no need to tell you that. The second, whose nickname is ‘the block of wood,’ is a simple soul. The third is called ‘the rose’ — lovely to look at, but prickly. It’s a pity she wasn’t born of the mistress; a phoenix from a crow’s nest. The fourth is still young. She’s Master Zhen’s sister by the same father, but our mistress brought her up, and she’s another who doesn’t bother about affairs.\n\n“But that’s not all, madam. We have two other young ladies who are real beauties, the likes of whom you won’t find again in the whole world. One is the daughter of our master’s sister, her name is Lin; the other is the daughter of Aunt Xue, her name is Xue. Both are good scholars. Whenever we see them getting into a carriage or meet them in the garden, we hardly dare even breathe.”\n\n“You have such strict rules, when a young boy like you goes in and meets the young ladies, of course you should hide and not dare to breathe.”\n\n“No, it’s not that we daren’t breathe.” Xinger waved this objection aside. “We’re afraid that if we breathed too hard we might blow Miss Lin away; and if we breathed too warm....”\n\n“You’ve melted Miss Xue away!” This set the whole room laughing.\n\nTo know whom Third Sister You wished to marry, read the next chapter."
