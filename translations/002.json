  "original": "却说封肃听见公差传唤，忙出来陪笑启问，那些人只嚷：“快请出甄爷来。”封肃忙陪笑道：“小人姓封，并不姓甄。只有当日小婿姓甄，今已出家一二年了，不知可是问他？”那些公人道：“我们也不知什么‘真’‘假’，既是你的女婿，就带了你去面禀太爷便了。”大家把封肃推拥而去，封家各各惊慌，不知何事。至二更时分，封肃方回来，众人忙问端的。“原来新任太爷姓贾名化，本湖州人氏，曾与女婿旧交，因在我家门首看见娇杏丫头买线，只说女婿移住此间，所以来传。我将缘故回明，那太爷感伤叹息了一回又问外孙女儿，我说看灯丢了。太爷说：‘不妨，待我差人去，务必找寻回来。’说了一回话，临走又送我二两银子。”甄家娘子听了，不觉感伤。一夜无话。\n　　次日，早有雨村遣人送了两封银子、四匹锦缎，答谢甄家娘子；又一封密书与封肃，托他向甄家娘子要那娇杏作二房。封肃喜得眉开眼笑，巴不得去奉承太爷，便在女儿前一力撺掇。当夜用一乘小轿，便把娇杏送进衙内去了。雨村欢喜，自不必言，又封百金赠与封肃，又送甄家娘子许多礼物，令其且自过活，以待访寻女儿下落。\n　　却说娇杏那丫头，便是当年回顾雨村的，因偶然一看便弄出这段奇缘，也是意想不到之事。谁知他命运两济，不承望自到雨村身边，只一年便生一子，又半载雨村嫡配忽染疾下世，雨村便将他扶作正室夫人。正是：\n　　偶因一回顾，便为人上人。\n　　原来雨村因那年士隐赠银之后，他于十六日便起身赴京，大比之期，十分得意，中了进士，选入外班，今已升了本县太爷。虽才干优长，末免贪酷，且恃才侮上，那同寅皆侧目而视。不上一年，便被上司参了一本，说他貌似有才，性实狡猾，又题了一两件徇庇蠹役、交结乡绅之事，龙颜大怒，即命革职。部文一到，本府各官无不喜悦。那雨村虽十分惭恨，面上却全无一点怨色，仍是嘻笑自若，交代过了公事，将历年所积宦囊，并家属人等，送至原籍安顿妥当了，却自己担风袖月，游览天下胜迹。\n　　那日偶又游至淮扬地方，闻得今年盐政点的是林如海。这林如海姓林名海，表字如海，乃是前科的探花，今已升兰台寺大夫，本贯姑苏人氏，今钦点为巡盐御史，到任未久。原来这林如海之祖也曾袭过列侯的，今到如海，业经五世。起初只袭三世，因当今隆恩盛德，额外加恩，至如海之父又袭了一代，到了如海便从科第出身。虽系世禄之家，却是书香之族。只可惜这林家支庶不盛，人丁有限，虽有几门，却与如海俱是堂族，没甚亲支嫡派的。今如海年已五十，只有一个三岁之子，又于去岁亡了，虽有几房姬妻，奈命中无子，亦无可如何之事。只嫡妻贾氏生得一女，乳名黛玉，年方五岁，夫妻爱之如掌上明珠。见他生得聪明俊秀，也欲使他识几个字，不过假充养子，聊解膝下荒凉之叹。\n　　且说贾雨村在旅店偶感风寒，愈后又因盘费不继，正欲得一个居停之所以为息肩之地。偶遇两个旧友认得新盐政，知他正要请一西席教训女儿，遂将雨村荐进衙门去。这女学生年纪幼小，身体又弱，工课不限多寡，其馀不过两个伴读丫鬟，故雨村十分省力，正好养病。看看又是一载有馀，不料女学生之母贾氏夫人一病而亡。女学生奉侍汤药，守丧尽礼，过于哀痛，素本怯弱，因此旧病复发，有好些时不曾上学。雨村闲居无聊，每当风日晴和，饭后便出来闲步。\n　　这一日偶至郊外，意欲赏鉴那村野风光。信步至一山环水游、茂林修竹之处，隐隐有座庙宇，门巷倾颓，墙垣剥落。有额题曰“智通寺”。门旁又有一副旧破的对联云：\n　　身后有馀忘缩手；眼前无路想回头。\n　　雨村看了，因想道：“这两句文虽甚浅，其意则深。也曾游过些名山大刹，倒不曾见过这话头，其中想必有个翻过筋斗来的也未可知，何不进去一访。”走入看时，只有一个龙钟老僧在那里煮粥。雨村见了，却不在意；及至问他两句话，那老僧既聋且昏，又齿落舌钝，所答非所问。雨村不耐烦，仍退出来，意欲到那村肆中沽饮三杯，以助野趣。于是移步行来。刚人肆门，只见座上吃酒之客有一人起身大笑，接了出来，口内说：“奇遇，奇遇！”雨村忙看时，此人是都中古董行中贸易姓冷号子兴的，旧日在都相识。雨村最赞这冷子兴是个有作为大本领的人，这子兴又借雨村斯文之名，故二人最相投契。雨村忙亦笑问：“老兄何日到此？弟竟不知。今日偶遇，真奇缘也。”子兴道：“去年岁底到家，今因还要入都，从此顺路找个敝友说一句话。承他的情，留我多住两日。我也无甚紧事，且盘桓两日，待月半时也就起身了。今日敝友有事，我因闲走到此，不期这样巧遇！”一面说一面让雨村同席坐了，另整上酒看来。\n　　二人闲谈慢饮，叙些别后之事。雨村因问：“近日都中可有新闻没有？”子兴道：“倒没有什么新闻，倒是老先生的贵同宗家出了一件小小的异事。”雨村笑道：“弟族中无人在都，何谈及此？”子兴笑道：“你们同姓，岂非一族？”雨村问：“是谁家？”子兴笑道：“荣国贾府中，可也不玷辱老先生的门楣了。”雨村道：“原来是他家。若论起来，寒族人丁却自不少，东汉贾复以来，支派繁盛，各省皆有，谁能逐细考查？若论荣国一支，却是同谱。但他那等荣耀，我们不便去认他，故越发生疏了。”子兴叹道：“老先生休这样说。如今的这荣、宁两府，也都萧索了，不比先时的光景。”雨村道：“当日宁荣两宅人口也极多，如何便萧索了呢？”子兴道：“正是，说来也话长。”\n    雨村道：“去岁我去金陵时，因欲游览六朝遗迹，那日进了石头城，从他宅门前经过。街东是宁国府，街西是荣国府，二宅相连，竟将大半条街占了。大门外虽冷落无人，隔着围墙一望，里面厅殿楼阁也还都峥嵘轩峻，就是后边一带花园里，树木山石，也都还有葱蔚洇润之气，那里象个衰败之家。”子兴笑道：“亏你是进士出身，原来不通。古人有言：‘百足之虫，死而不僵。’如今虽说不似先年那样兴盛，较之平常仕宦人家，到底气象不同。如今人口日多，事务日盛，主仆上下都是安富尊荣，运筹谋画的竟无一个，那日用排场，又不能将就省俭。如今外面的架子虽没很倒，内囊却也尽上来了。这也是小事。更有一件大事：谁知这样钟鸣鼎食的人家儿，如今养的儿孙，竟一代不如一代了。”\n　　雨村听说，也道：“这样诗礼之家，岂有不善教育之理？别门不知，只说这宁荣两宅，是最教子有方的，何至如此？”子兴叹道：“正说的是这两门呢。等我告诉你。当日宁国公是一母同胞弟兄两个。宁公居长，生了两个儿子。宁公死后，长子贾代化袭了官，也养了两个儿子：长子名贾敷，八九岁上死了，只剩了一个次子贾敬，袭了官，如今一味好道，只爱烧丹炼汞，别事一概不管。幸而早年留下一个儿子，名唤贾珍，因他父亲想作神仙，把官倒让他袭了。他父亲又不肯住往家里，只在都中城外和那些道士们胡羼。这位珍爷也生了个儿子，今年才十六岁，名叫贾蓉。如今敬老爷不管事了，这珍爷那里于正事，只一味高乐不了，把那宁国府竟翻过来了，也没有敢来管他的人。\n   再说荣府你听：方才所说异事就出在这里。自荣公死后，长子贾代善袭了官，娶的是金陵世家史侯的小姐为妻。生了两个儿子，长名贾赦，次名贾政。如今代善早已去世，太夫人尚在。长子贾赦袭了官，为人却也中平，也不管理家事，惟有次子贾政，自幼酷喜读书，为人端方正直。祖父钟爱，原要他从科甲出身，不料代善临终遗本一上，皇上怜念先臣，即叫长子袭了官。又问还有几个儿子，立刻引见，又将这政老爷赐了个额外主事职衔，叫他入部习学，如今现已升了员外郎。这政老爷的夫人王氏，头胎生的公子名叫贾珠，十四岁进学，后来娶了妻，生了子，不到二十岁，一病就死了。第二胎生了一位小姐，生在大年初一就奇了，不想隔了十几年，又生了一位公子，说来更奇：一落胞胎，嘴里便衔下一块五彩晶莹的玉来，还有许多字迹。你道是新闻不是？”\n　　雨村笑道：“果然奇异，只怕这人的来历不小。”子兴冷笑道：“万人都这样说，因而他祖母爱如珍宝。那周岁时，政老爷试他将来的志向，便将世上所有的东西摆了无数叫他抓。谁知他一概不取，伸手只把些脂粉钗环抓来玩弄，那政老爷便不喜欢，说将来不过酒色之徒，因此不甚爱惜。独那太君还是命根子一般。说来又奇，如今长了十来岁，虽然淘气异常，但聪明乖觉，百个不及他一个，说起孩子话来也奇，他说：‘女儿是水做的骨肉，男子是泥做的肉。我见了女儿便清爽，见了男子便觉浊臭逼人。’你道好笑不好笑？将来色鬼无疑了！”\n　　雨村罕然厉色道：“非也！可惜你们不知道这人的来历，大约政老前辈也错以淫魔色鬼看待了。若非多读书识事，加以致知格物之功、悟道参玄之力者，不能知也。”子兴见他说得这样重大，忙请教其故。雨村道：“天地生人，除大仁大恶，馀者皆无大异。若大仁者则应运而生，大恶者则应劫而生，运生世治，劫生世危。尧、舜、禹、汤、文、武、周、召、孔、孟、董、韩、周、程、朱、张，皆应运而生者；蚩、尤、共工、桀、纣、始皇、王莽、曹操、桓温、安禄山、秦桧等，皆应劫而生者。大仁者修治天下，大恶者扰乱天下。清明灵秀，天地之正气，仁者之所秉也；残忍乖僻，天地之邪气，恶者之所秉也。今当柞永运隆之日，太平无为之世，清明灵秀之气所秉者，上自朝廷，下至草野，比比皆是。所馀之秀气漫无所归，遂为甘露，为和风，洽然溉及四海。彼残忍乖邪之气，不能荡溢于光天化日之下，遂凝结充塞于深沟大整之中。偶因风荡，或被云摧，略有摇动感发之急，一丝半缕误而逸出者，值灵秀之气适过，正不容邪，邪复妒正，两不相下，如风水雷电，地中既遇，既不能消，又不能让，必致搏击掀发。既然发泄，那邪气亦必赋之于人。假使或男或女偶秉此气而生者，上则不能为仁人为君子，下亦不能为大凶大恶。置之千万人之中，其聪俊灵秀之气，则在于万人之上；其乖僻邪谬不近人情之态，又在千万人之下。若生于公侯富贵之家，则为情痴情种。若生于诗书清贫之族，则为逸士高人。纵然生于薄祚寒门，甚至为奇优，为名娼，亦断不至为走卒健仆，甘遭庸夫驱制。如前之许由、陶潜、阮籍、稽康、刘伶、王谢二族、顾虎头、陈后主、唐明皇、宋徽宗、刘庭芝、温飞卿、米南宫、石曼卿、柳耆卿、秦少游，近日倪云林、唐伯虎、祝枝山，再如李龟年、黄幡绰、敬新磨、卓文君、红拂、薛涛、崔莺、朝云之流，此皆易地则同之人也。”\n　　子兴道：“依你说，‘成则公侯败则贼’了？”雨村道：“正是这意。你还不知，我自革职以来，这两年遍游各省，也曾遇见两个异样孩子，所以方才你一说这宝玉我就猜着了，八九也是这一派人物。不用远说，只这金陵城内钦差金陵省体仁院总裁甄家，你可知道？”子兴道：“谁人不知！这甄府就是贾府老亲，他们两家来往极亲热的。就是我也和他家往来非止一日了。”雨村笑道：“去岁我在金陵，也曾有人荐我到甄府处馆。我进去看其光景，谁知他家那等荣贵，却是个富而好礼之家，倒是个难得之馆。但是这个学生虽是启蒙，却比一个举业的还劳神。说起来更可笑，他说：‘必得两个女儿陪着我读书，我方能认得字，心上也明白，不然我心里自己糊涂。’又常对着跟他的小厮们说：‘这女儿两个字极尊贵极清净的，比那瑞兽珍禽、奇花异草更觉希罕尊贵呢，你们这种浊口臭舌万万不可唐突了这两个字，要紧，要紧！但凡要说的时节，必用净水香茶漱了口方可，设若失错，便要凿牙穿眼的。’其暴虐顽劣，种种异常。只放了学，进去见了那些女儿们，其温厚和平、聪敏文雅，竟变了一个样子。因此他令尊也曾下死笞楚过几次，竟不能改。每打的吃疼不过时，他便‘姐姐’‘妹妹’的乱叫起来。后来听得里面女儿们拿他取笑：‘因何打急了只管叫姐妹作什么？莫不叫姐妹们去讨情讨饶？你岂不愧些！’他回答的最妙，他说；‘急痛之时，只叫姐姐妹字样，或可解疼也未未可知，因叫了一声，果觉疼得好些。遂得了秘法，每疼痛之极，便连叫姐妹起来了。’你说可笑不可笑？为他祖母溺爱不明，每因孙辱师责子，我所以辞了馆出来的。这等于弟必不能守祖父基业、从师友规劝的。只可惜他家几个好妹妹都是少有的！”\n　　子兴道：“便是贾府中现在三个也不错。政老爷的长女名元春，因贤孝才德，选入宫作女史去了。二小姐乃是赦老爷姨娘所出，名迎春。三小姐政老爷庶出，名探春。四小姐乃宁府珍爷的胞妹，名惜春。因史老夫人极爱孙女，都跟在祖母这边，一处读书，听得个个不错。”雨村道：“更妙在甄家风俗，女儿之名亦皆从男子之名，不似别人家里另外用这些‘春’‘红’‘香’‘玉’等艳字。何得贾府亦落此俗套？”子兴道：“不然。只因现今大小姐是正月初一所生，故名‘元春’，馀者都从了‘春’字，上一排的却也是从弟兄而来的。现有对证，目今你贵东家林公的夫人，即荣府中赦、政二公的胞妹，在家时名字唤贾敏。不信时你回去细访可知。”雨村拍手笑道：“是极。我这女学生名叫黛玉，他读书凡‘敏’字他皆念作‘密’字，写字遇着‘敏’字亦减一二笔。我心中每每疑惑，今听你说，是为此无疑矣。怪道我这女学生言语举止另是一样，不与凡女子相同。度其母不凡，故生此女，今知为荣府之外孙，又不足罕矣。可惜上月其母竟亡故了。”叹道：“妹妹三个，这是极小的，又没了，长一辈的妹妹一个也没了。只看这小一辈的，将来的东床何如呢？”\n　　雨村道：“正是。方才说政公已有一个衔玉之子，又有长子所遗弱孙，这赦老竟无一个不成？”子兴道：“政公既有玉儿之后，其妻又生了一个，倒不知其好歹。只眼前现有二子一孙，却不知将来何如？若问那赦老爷，也有一子，名叫贾琏，今已二十多岁了，亲上做亲，娶的是政老爷夫人王氏内侄女，今已娶了四五年。这位琏爷身上现捐了个同知，也是不喜正务的，于世路上好机变，言谈去得，所以目今现在乃叔政老爷家住，帮着料理家务。谁知自娶了这位奶奶之后，倒上下无人不称颂他的夫人，琏爷倒退了一舍之地。模样又极标致，言谈又爽利，心机又极深细，竟是个男人万不及一的。”雨村听了笑道：“可知我言不谬了。你我方才所说的这几个人，只怕都是那正邪两赋而来，一路之人，未可知也。”\n　　子兴道：“正也罢，邪也罢，只顾算别人家的账，你也吃杯酒才好。”雨村道：“只顾说话，就多吃了几杯。”笑道：“说着别人家的闲话，正好下酒，即多吃几杯何妨。”雨村向窗外看道：“天也晚了，仔细关了城，我们慢慢进城再谈，未为不可。”于是二人起身，算还酒钱。方欲走时，忽听得后面有人叫道：“雨村兄恭喜了！特来报个喜信的。”雨村忙回头看时，    ——要知是谁，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Feng Su came out with a smile to ask what they wanted. “Fetch Mr. Zhen!” they bawled.\n\n“My name is Feng, not Zhen. My son-in-law’s name is Zhen, but he left home to become a Taoist priest a year or two ago. Is it him you want?”\n\n“We don’t know whether he’s true or false,” growled the runners. “Just bring him along, and you can explain to the magistrate.”\n\nThey hustled Feng Su away, leaving the whole household trembling. Not until the second watch did he return, and they pressed him for news.\n\n“The new magistrate, Mr. Jia Hua, is a native of Huzhou. He was a friend of my son-in-law’s. Seeing Jiao Xing at our gate buying thread today, he thought Zhen Shiyin had moved here and sent runners to fetch him. I explained what had happened. The magistrate seemed very upset and asked after my little granddaughter. When I told him she was lost during the Lantern Festival, he said, ‘Never mind. I’ll send men to find her and bring her back.’ After a little more talk he gave me two taels of silver.”\n\nZhen Shiyin’s wife was very touched by this. The night passed without further incident.\n\nThe next day Jia Yucun sent two packets of silver and four rolls of silk as a present for Mrs. Zhen, and a confidential letter to Feng Su asking him to persuade his daughter to let Jiao Xing become the magistrate’s second wife. Feng Su was delighted and lost no time in urging her to comply. That very evening he put Jiao Xing in a small sedan-chair and escorted her to the yamen.\n\nYucun’s jubilation can be imagined. He gave Feng Su a hundred pieces of gold and sent rich presents to Mrs. Zhen with a promise to find her daughter.\n\nNow this maid Jiao Xing was the one who had turned back to look at Yucun in the old days. A casual glance had led to this strange coincidence — a striking example of fortune favouring the unexpected. For less than a year after becoming his concubine she bore him a son, and then his wife died. He raised Jiao Xing to the position of his principal wife, as the verse puts it:\n\nA single chance glance  \nRaised her to rank.\n\nAfter Shiyin made Yucun that gift of silver to go to the capital, on the sixteenth the young man started out for Beijing. He passed the examination in flying colours and became a palace graduate, after which he was selected as a probationary magistrate. Now he had been promoted to this post. Although a capable administrator, Yucun was grasping and ruthless and, while presuming on his ability, he offended his superiors. In less than two years they found a pretext to impeach him. He was accused of “ingrained duplicity” and of “disgracing the office of a scholar” by “tolerating the rapacity of his underlings and trespassing on the rights of the local gentry.” The court, therefore, ordered his disgrace.\n\nHis colleagues were delighted. But although mortified and enraged, Yucun gave no sign of his feelings and went about looking as cheerful as before. After handing over his affairs he gathered the capital accumulated during his years in office and moved his family back to his native place. There he lived in comfort, off and on, for a year, until all his money was spent. Then, wishing to see more of the world’s famous mountains and rivers, he set out to travel, unhampered, as a common citizen.\n\nOne day in Yangzhou he heard that the Salt Commissioner that year was Lin Ru-hai. This Lin Ru-hai, whose courtesy name was Haiyu, had come first in the palace examination three years before and recently been promoted to the Censorate. A native of Gusu, he had now been selected as Salt Commissioner. He had reached this post by sheer merit, for his forefathers, who had been ennobled five generations ago, had had their rank conferred on them for only three generations. Thanks, however, to the extraordinary kindness of the present emperor, this had been extended for one more generation, so that Lin Ru-hai’s father inherited the title as well. But since Lin Ru-hai had no brothers and the family was not well off, he had taken the official examinations. He came of a scholarly family and had many distinguished connections. Unfortunately, however, the Lin family had not been prolific, and though by now it had five branches its members were not numerous. Lin Ru-hai was in his forties and had only one three-year-old son.\n\nThe year before this his wife had died; and although he had several concubines he was fated to have no son, so this was a loss he had to put up with. His only child, born to his worthy wife nee Jia, was a daughter named Daiyu just five years old. Both parents loved her dearly. And because she was as intelligent as she was pretty, they decided to give her a good education to make up for their lack of a son and help them forget their loss.\n\nJia Yucun had caught a chill in the inn which developed into a chill and fever. As he was recovering from this at the end of the second month, he found his funds running out and wanted to move to some place where he could live more cheaply. He had spent a couple of months there when the money given him by his friend was gone, and the inn-keeper made tactful representations. The local people, knowing that the new Salt Commissioner had been a classmate of Yucun’s, suggested that he should apply to him for help.\n\nYucun made a mental note of this but refrained from acting on it. “I’ve given him a face already,” he thought. “If I ask for more help, that might make him despise me for my importunity.”\n\nWhile he was hesitating the inn-keeper one day announced that a Mr. Leng Zixing from the capital, who was an assistant in the Salt Commissioner’s yamen, had called to see him on his way to the capital. Yucun was delighted. Hurrying out he found it was an old acquaintance who had come to offer his congratulations. He lost no time in asking the inn-keeper to prepare a meal and produce some wine.\n\n“After I left the capital I was laid up here for over a month through being short of funds,” he told Zixing. “That’s why I couldn’t join my colleague. I’m so glad you’ve come, sir. Please be seated and let us warm some wine while we talk.”\n\nThey chatted so long and so cheerfully that it was late before they dispersed. The next day Yucun went to the Salt Commissioner’s yamen to express his thanks, and Lin invited him to a meal.\n\nSoon after this Lin Ruhai wrote a letter to his brother-in-law Jia Zheng in the capital recommending Yucun to him; and Jia Zheng, out of regard for his brother-in-law, found Yucun a post as a second-class secretary in the Board of Works. So less than two months later Yucun left for Jinling. But no more of this.\n\nTo return to Daiyu. When her mother died she was so grief-stricken that she fell ill again and had to abandon her studies. Her father, advanced in years, had no desire to marry again; and there was no one to look after the child. He decided therefore to send her to her maternal grandmother in the capital.\n\nHer grandmother’s family, the Jias, was a renowned and highly cultured house. Of its many members both old and young, all were devoted to pleasure. And now that the Lady Dowager was told that her daughter was dead and her granddaughter was arriving, she did her utmost to have the child fetched as quickly as possible. The two maid-servants escorting Daiyu were thus able to enter the capital and reach the Rong Mansion with no trouble.\n\nDaiyu had been constantly depressed by her mother’s death and now she had to leave her father. So although she knew she was going to a comfortable home she was very loath to part with him and start the long journey. However, she had to do as her father wished. She embarked with her nurse and some elderly maid-servants from the Lin family, accompanied by the two servants sent by the Jias, and started for the capital.\n\nIn due course they reached it and entered the city. Peeping through the gauze window of her sedan-chair at the bustle in the streets and the crowds of people, the fine shops and large mansions in the capital, Daiyu reflected that it was indeed a different world from Yangzhou. After what seemed a long time they came to a street with two huge stone lions crouching on the north side, flanking a great triple gate with beast-head knockers, in front of which ten or more men in smart livery were sitting. The central gate was shut, but people were passing in and out of the smaller side gates. On a board above the main gate was written in large characters: Ningguo Mansion Built at Imperial Command.\n\n“This must be where my elder uncle lives,” thought Daiyu.\n\nA little further to the west they came to another imposing triple gate. This was the Rong Mansion. Instead of going through the main gate, they entered by the smaller one on the west. The bearers carried the chair a bow-shot further, then set it down at a turning and withdrew. The maid-servants behind Daiyu had now alighted and were proceeding on foot. Three or four smartly dressed lads of seventeen or eighteen picked up the chair and, followed by the maids, carried it to a gate decorated with overhanging flowery patterns carved in wood. There they set it down, and one of the maid-servants drew aside the curtain of the chair as another helped Daiyu out.\n\nShe noticed that the lintel of the gate was surmounted by a board with the words: Peppercorn Gallery in bold characters. As they entered the gallery an old nurse with two or three serving-women hurried to meet them, beaming, and asked Daiyu to wait here while they announced her. A maid returned after a short interval to invite them in, and two other nurses came to raise the portiere. As Daiyu passed through the entrance hall she saw a large screen of polished marble in a red sandalwood frame. Rounding this, she came to the reception hall, which had a large courtyard and five rooms with finely carved and painted beams and eaves.\n\nA raised verandah ran along both sides of the courtyard, on which stood several red-lacquered racks for peacocks and parrots. Five or six maids dressed in red and green were standing there, and at sight of them they cried, “The old lady was just asking about you. Here you are.”\n\nThen one of them raised the portiere and another announced, “Miss Lin is here.”\n\nAs Daiyu entered, she saw a silver-haired old lady leaning on the arm of an attendant. She knew that this must be her grandmother. But before she could curtsey she was clasped to the old lady’s breast, then held in her arms as she cried heart-brokenly. All the attendants were overcome with tears, and Daiyu herself could not keep from weeping. When the others had gradually comforted the old lady and stopped her tears, Daiyu made her curtsey. This the Lady Dowager forestalled by taking her hand in both of hers.\n\n“You poor thing! What a cruel fate your mother suffered, dying so young!” she exclaimed. “If I hadn’t this child I couldn’t bear to go on living.” She broke down again.\n\nThe attendants were afraid that too much weeping might be bad for the old lady, who was advanced in years, so they tried to reason with her and cheer her up.\n\nAs they did this, Daiyu was led forward to see her two aunts, Lady Xing the wife of her uncle Jia She, and Lady Wang the wife of her uncle Jia Zheng. Then the old lady sent for the girls.\n\nPresently the three young ladies appeared, attended by three nurses and five or six maids.\n\nThe first was somewhat plump and of medium height. Her cheeks were the texture of newly ripened lichees, her nose as sleek as goose fat. Gentle and demure, she looked very approachable.\n\nThe second had sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She was tall and slim, with an oval face, well-defined eyebrows and lovely dancing eyes. She seemed elegant and quick-witted with an air of distinction. To look at her was to forget everything vulgar.\n\nThe third was not yet fully grown, and still had the face of a child.\n\nAll three were dressed in similar tunics and skirts with the same bracelets and head ornaments.\n\nDaiyu rose quickly to greet these cousins.\n\nAfter the exchange of greetings they took seats while the maids served tea. All the time Daiyu was answering questions about her mother’s illness and death, and how her father was faring, the old lady kept interrupting.\n\nShe had been worrying because none of the girls here had as good a figure and deportment as Daiyu; but now that her grand-daughter had come, she was overjoyed. She asked Daiyu what books she had studied.\n\n“I’ve just finished the Four Books,” said Daiyu. “But I’m very ignorant.”\n\nThen she inquired about the other girls’ studies.\n\n“They’ve just nibbled at a few characters, that’s all,” said the old lady.\n\nAs they were talking, they heard footsteps in the courtyard and a maid came in to announce, “Baoyu is here.”\n\nDaiyu was wondering what sort of graceless scamp or little dunce Baoyu was and feeling reluctant to meet such a stupid creature, when in he walked.\n\nHe had on a golden coronet studded with jewels and a golden chaplet in the form of two dragons fighting for a pearl. His red archer’s jacket, embroidered with golden butterflies and flowers, was tied with a coloured tasselled palace sash. Over this he wore a turquoise fringed coat of Japanese satin with a raised pattern of flowers in eight bunches. His court boots were of black satin with white soles.\n\nHis face was as radiant as the mid-autumn moon, his complexion fresh as spring flowers at dawn. The hair above his temples was as sharply outlined as if cut with a knife. His eyebrows were as black as if painted with ink, his cheeks as red as peach-blossom, his eyes bright as autumn ripples. Even when angry he seemed to smile, and there was warmth in his glance even when he frowned.\n\nRound his neck he had a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon, and a silk cord of five colours, on which hung a beautiful piece of jade.\n\nAs soon as she saw him Daiyu gave a start.\n\n“How very strange!” she thought. “It’s as if I’d seen him somewhere before. He looks so familiar.”\n\nBaoyu paid his respects to the Lady Dowager and upon her instructions went to see his mother.\n\nHe returned before long, having changed his clothes. His short hair in small plaits tied with red silk was drawn up on the crown of his head and braided into one thick queue as black and glossy as lacquer, secured by a scarlet clasp and embroidered with four pearls which formed the lucky word “long life.” From his ears hung two rings of red and green jade. He had a dark red archer’s jacket, fringed with bright colours, and his variegated silk sash was embroidered with butterflies and flowers. In accordance with the fashion he wore a turquoise-coloured flowered satin cloak, lined with white squirrel, and russet-leather boots embroidered with blue and gold thread in a cloud pattern. His face, fair as the moon, seemed even more fascinating, his eyes, brimming with love, even more charming. What handsome features he had!\n\nBut although Daiyu was startled by his familiarity, she had no time to probe into this because the Lady Dowager scolded:\n\n“Fancy changing your clothes before greeting our visitor. Hurry up now and pay your respects to your cousin.”\n\nOf course, Baoyu had seen this new cousin earlier on and guessed that she was the daughter of his Aunt Lin. He made haste to bow to her, and when he raised his head to look at her carefully he felt that he had seen her before too. He asked if they had not met before.\n\n“No,” said Daiyu. “I’m sure I’ve never seen you. How could we have met?”\n\n“Well, her face is familiar,” he said with a smile. “It’s as if we’d met before.”\n\n“That’s impossible,” retorted the Lady Dowager. “You’ve never been to the south. How could you have seen her?”\n\nBaoyu paid no attention but went on staring at Daiyu until she lowered her head. Then he asked:\n\n“Have you studied yet, cousin?”\n\n“No,” said Daiyu. “I’ve only had a couple of years’ schooling and can just read a few characters.”\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\nShe told him.\n\n“And your courtesy name?”\n\n“I have none.”\n\n“I’ll give you one then,” he proposed with a chuckle. “What could be better than Pinpin?”\n\n“Where’s that from?” asked Tanchun.\n\n“The Compendium of Men and Objects Old and New says that in the west is a stone called dai which can be used instead of graphite for painting eyebrows. As Cousin Lin’s eyebrows look half frowning, what could be better than those two characters for her courtesy name?”\n\n“You’re making that up, I’m sure, brother,” protested Tanchun.\n\n“Why, most works, apart from the Four Books, are made up; am I the only one who tells lies?” he retorted with a laugh. Then, to Daiyu’s surprise, he asked if she had any jade.\n\nShe thought, “No, he hasn’t got one either. That’s why he asks.” So she answered, “No, I haven’t. I suppose it’s too rare for everybody to have one.”\n\nThis threw Baoyu into one of the frenzies which he was subject to ever since his childhood. Tearing off the jade he flung it on the ground.\n\n“What’s rare about it?” he stormed. “It can’t even tell good people from bad. What spiritual understanding has it got? I don’t want this nuisance either.”\n\nIn consternation all the maids rushed forward to pick up the jade while the Lady Dowager in desperation took Baoyu in her arms.\n\n“You wicked monster!” she scolded. “Lose your temper with people if you like. But why should you throw away that precious thing your life depends on?”\n\nHis face stained with tears, Baoyu sobbed, “None of the girls here has one, only me. What’s the fun of that? Even this newly arrived cousin who’s lovely as a fairy hasn’t got one either. That shows it’s no good.”\n\n“She did have one once,” said the old lady to soothe him. “But because when your aunt was dying she couldn’t bear to leave your cousin, she had to take the jade with her instead. That was instead of burying the living with the dead, you know. It was to show her love and respect for your aunt. So your cousin said she had no jade to avoid making a display. Now why not wear yours dear boy, lest your mother should be upset?”\n\nShe took the jade from a maid and put it on him herself. And Baoyu, convinced by this, let the matter drop.\n\nJust then a nurse came to ask where Daiyu was to stay.\n\n“Move Baoyu into the alcove in my room,” said the Lady Dowager. “Miss Lin can have the blue gauze bed-curtains put up for her in his place for the time being. We can make other arrangements in the spring when it’s warmer.”\n\n“Dear cousin,” said Baoyu, “if you’ll stay here I’ll give up this place to you. I’ll bed down with the old lady and we can talk.”\n\n“You’d better stay where you are,” said his grandmother. “Your mother’s not well and we don’t want to disturb her.”\n\nAfter some further discussion it was finally decided that Daiyu should stay in the green gauze lodge and Baoyu would keep the old lady company in her outer room. The other attendants, who had been waiting for this decision, now escorted Daiyu and her nurse to the green gauze lodge, while Baoyu’s attendants took his things away.\n\nIn fact, we are members of the same clan. But he is so grand that we don’t like to claim kinship and have drifted further apart than strangers.”\n\n“Don’t say that, sir,” urged Zixing. “Both the Ning and Rong Mansions are going downhill. They’re not as prosperous as they were.”\n\n“Why, there were so many of them in those two houses, how can they have come down in the world?” asked Yucun.\n\n“I know, it’s a long story,” said Zixing. “Last year when I was in Jinling I passed their gates on my way to visit the Six Dynasties ruins. The Ning Mansion on the east side and the Rong Mansion on the west were joined together and, with the grounds round them, must have occupied half the street. Although there was not a soul outside the main gate, looking over the wall I could see that the halls and pavilions inside were still exceedingly imposing. And the garden behind, with its trees and rockeries, had a flourishing look. There was no sign of a decline.”\n\n“It’s not like you, a palace graduate, to be so imperceptive,” chuckled Zixing. “As the old saying goes: ‘A centipede dies but never stiffens.’ Although they’re not as well off as before, they’re still a cut above ordinary official families. They’re getting more and more extravagant and their household is increasing. The masters and mistresses are too pleasure-loving to manage affairs, and they won’t exercise economy. Although the outer framework is still there, the inside is nearly drained. That’s a minor trouble, though. They’ve worse problems than that. Who could have guessed that the sons and grandsons of such noble and scholarly families would be each generation less worthy than the last?”\n\nYucun looked surprised. “Surely well-bred families like that know how to educate their sons? I can’t answer for other clans, but I’ve always been told that the Jias of the Ning and Rong houses brought their sons up very strictly.”\n\n“That’s exactly the two families I had in mind. Let me tell you what happened. After the death of the Duke of Ningguo, the elder son Jia Daishan inherited his title. He had two sons. The elder, Jia Fu, died when he was eight or nine, leaving the younger, Jia Jing, to succeed. Now Jia Jing has only one interest in life — Taoism — and spends all his time over his elixirs. He refused to take office, but luckily he had a son Jia Zhen while he was still young, so he let the boy inherit the title in his stead. And instead of living at home he has gone outside the city to mix with Taoist priests. Jia Zhen has a son called Jia Rong, who is just sixteen. As his father takes no interest in affairs, Jia Zhen has thrown all restraint to the winds. He has turned the Ning Mansion upside down, yet nobody dares to restrain him.\n\n“Now for the Rong Mansion. That’s where the strange business I just mentioned took place. After the death of the Duke of Rongguo, the elder son Jia Daishan inherited the title and married the daughter of Marquis Shi of Jinling. Two sons were born of this union, Jia She and Jia Zheng. Jia Daishan is dead now but the old lady is still alive. Jia She, the elder son, inherited the title. He is a mediocre sort of man. Jia Zheng, the younger, was a studious boy, a dignified, straightforward gentleman. His grandfather doted on him and he would have taken the palace examination had not when his father died the Emperor out of regard for the deceased granted the elder son the title and asked if there were other sons. He then summoned Jia Zheng to court and gave him the post of an additional undersecretary in the Board of Works. He has now risen to the rank of under-secretary. His wife, Lady Wang, bore him first a son called Jia Zhu, who passed the district examination at fourteen, married before he was twenty, and then fell ill and died. The second child was a daughter.”\n\nYucun smiled. “It certainly is strange. I doubt that this boy will grow up into an ordinary man.”\n\nZixing sniffed. “That’s what everyone says. And because of it his grandmother has been spoiling him shockingly. When he was one year old, Lord Zheng tested his disposition by setting all sorts of different objects before him to see which he would choose. Believe it or not, ignoring everything else he reached out for the rouge, powder-boxes, hair ornaments and bangles! His father was furious and swore he’d grow up a dissolute rake. Because of that he’s not too fond of the boy, but his grandmother still dotes on him.\n\n“He’s a queer kid, too. For although he’s only about ten he’s exceptionally mischievous, yet so clever you wouldn’t believe it. And he says the strangest things for a child. ‘Girls are made of water, men of mud,’ he says. ‘I feel clean and refreshed when I’m with girls but find men dirty and stinking.’ Isn’t that absurd? He’s bound to grow up a lady-killer.”\n\nYucun looked grave. “Not so. I’m afraid you don’t understand. I fancy Lord Zheng has misjudged him too. It would be hard for anyone but a man of great learning and insight to see what makes him tick.”\n\nImpressed by his earnestness, Zixing asked him to explain.\n\nYucun continued, “Of the people born into the world, those who are highly exceptional are good, those who are highly exceptional are bad — the rest are of no account. The good are born to rule, the bad to make trouble. The good bring order, the bad chaos. The good are the pure, intelligent essence of the forces of nature, the bad its cruel, perverse residue. Born into an era of peace and prosperity like ours, the good essence of nature, permeating the whole world, is everywhere. And the cruel, perverse residue, unable to vent itself under the clear, bright sky, congeals and fills the deep ditches and valleys. Then, stirred by the wind or drawn by clouds, these essences may suddenly come to life. And if a man is born with this perverse residue, then whether he comes from a rich and noble family or from some humble, needy house, he is bound to be a scourge to his country and his family, a monster.\n\n“If on the other hand the pure, intelligent essence is stronger, then whether born into a family of scholars or among the common people, he is sure to become a great gentleman or a man of outstanding ability. You can count such men on your fingers. The rest are the common herd who neither help nor hinder the world’s development.\n\n“The good essence prevails in our peaceful, prosperous age, the cruel, perverse residue is unable to manifest itself. And since it cannot take human form, it finds an outlet in moisture and exhalations, giving rise to miasmas, unseasonable weather, insect plagues and the like. In the depths of the mountains or great marshes, where the sun and moon seldom shine, this residue may assume the shape of a spectral tiger, a phantom python, a vampire or ghoul — things which delude and harm people.\n\n“When the perverse residue, stirred by wind or drawn by clouds, chances to meet the good essence, good refuses to yield to evil nor evil to good, and as neither can get the better of the other they must cancel out. But since wind cannot stay the waves nor clouds stop the rain, some slight disturbance is bound to occur. Then these essences, having permeated the whole world, may suddenly come to life.

They were all the same sort of people.’\n\n‘You mean, I take it, that “success makes a lord, failure makes a rebel”,’ said Zi-xing.\n\n‘Precisely,’ said Yu-cun. ‘But you may not be aware that since my dismissal I have spent the last two years travelling all over the place, and in the course of my travels I have run into a couple of extraordinary boys. That is why, when you mentioned Bao-yu just now, I guessed that he must be the same sort of person. But you don’t have to go outside Nanking to find another example. There is a family in Nanking with an official position comparable to your own – the Zhen family. You must have heard of them, I am sure?’\n\n‘Nobody who lives in Nanking could not have heard of them,’ said Zi-xing. ‘The Zhens are old friends and connections of the Jias. There is a very close relationship between the two families. I have had dealings with them myself on a number of occasions.’\n\nYu-cun laughed:\n\n‘When I was in Nanking last year someone recommended me to their household as a tutor. I was able to observe them pretty closely while I was there. They are a highly cultivated as well as a very wealthy family, I can tell you. But there was something very singular about the boy I was teaching. He was only at the elementary stage, yet he caused me more trouble than a candidate in the First Degree examination. To give you an example: he was for ever saying that he must have two girls to read with him in order that his reading should “take”. He said he couldn’t get the words to stick in his memory otherwise. He was always telling the pages who waited on him that the word “girl” was a very precious and important word and that they must on no account carelessly violate it. He said that you ought to rinse your mouth out with water and tea before uttering it and that you ought to get into the habit of doing this all the time, even when you were alone, because if you didn’t, your teeth would fall out and your eyes would drop out of their sockets. He was an extremely wild and intractable boy. But the moment the lessons were over and he went inside to see the girls of the family, he was completely transformed – amiable, obliging, and every inch the intelligent, understanding little gentleman. His father has thrashed him several times, but it does no good. When the beatings become too painful, he starts shouting “Girls! Girls!”. The girls inside laugh and ask him why he goes on calling to them when he is being beaten. “I suppose you think it might make us come out and intercede for you,” they say. “You ought to be more ashamed of yourself than ever!” You’ll never guess what his answer was. He said, “Once when I was being beaten very hard and the pain was more than I could bear, I started shouting ‘Girls!’ and, do you know, after I had been shouting for a while the pain really seemed less? So now, whenever I have to put up with pain, I keep on shouting ‘Girls!’ and it makes me feel better.” Now don’t you agree that that is a very extraordinary story?\n\n‘Because of the way his grandmother dotes on him, his father’s attempts to discipline him have only been half-hearted. That is why I felt obliged to resign my post. And that is why I feel sure that this boy will never be any good at carrying on his family’s traditions or at benefiting from the instruction of his teachers and friends. It is a great pity, though, about his sisters. They really are outstanding girls.’\n\n‘The Jia family has three young ladies who are equally outstanding,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Jia Zheng’s eldest daughter, Yuan-chun, was chosen on account of her exceptional virtue and intelligence to be a Lady Secretary in the Imperial Palace. The next one, Ying-chun, is Jia She’s daughter by a concubine. The third, Tan-chun, is Jia Zheng’s daughter by a concubine. The fourth, Xi-chun, is the younger sister of Mr Jia Zhen of the Ning-guo mansion. Old Lady Jia is very fond of her granddaughters and keeps them all in her own apartments where they are given the same tutors and receive the same education as Bao-yu. From all I have heard, each one of them is in her own way a very fine young woman. Sir Zheng’s wife, née Wang, had a little boy before she had Yuan-chun. He was called Jia Zhu. He married a wife from the Li family when he was fourteen and had a son by her, but he died young. The second child was Yuan-chun. Then she had another son, who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth – which is the one we have just been speaking about. Her most recent child is a little girl, also by Zheng, called Tan-chun. Sir She also has a son by a concubine called Jia Lian. He is now twenty and has been married these last two years to a wife from the Wang family. Jia Lian is at present living with his parents and is helping his father and Uncle Zheng with their affairs. Since his marriage, however, he has thrown his weight about rather a lot and has taken to drinking and gambling, so that he is not quite the nice young man he was. Sir Zheng’s concubine, Zhao, has had two children: a son called Jia Huan, who is now ten, and a daughter whose name I don’t remember. Another concubine of his has also had a son called Jia Zhong, but he is still only eight. And there are various others whom I needn’t trouble you with. Ning-guo Jia Dai-hua had four sons. Jia Dai-hua is dead now. The eldest of the sons, Jia Fu, died, too, at an early age. The second, Jia Jing, inherited the title. Jia Jing has always been fond of Taoist pursuits and is now spending all his time over in the Taoist temple outside the city cultivating the elixir of life. He long ago gave up any interest in officialdom. He had two children. The elder is a son called Jia Zhen, who inherited in his turn. He has a daughter called Xi-chun, who, as I told you, is now living with her grandmother in the Rong-guo house. Jia Jing gave up official life in order to devote himself to his spiritual quest, so the title passed to his son Jia Zhen. But Jia Zhen is not interested in official life either. He spends all his time amusing himself. He has a son called Jia Rong, who is sixteen. Old Mr Jia Dai-hua’s two younger sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng, are still alive and are now the heads of the two houses of Rong and Ning. Although the Jias are not particularly wealthy, the style in which they live is a very grand one.\n\n‘But to get back to Bao-yu. When he was a year old Sir Zheng, who was anxious to test his disposition, laid out a great number of objects in front of him – books, brushes, inkstones, cakes, playthings – and watched to see which of them he would choose. The little boy reached out immediately for the women’s things: the cosmetics, the jewellery, the toys. Sir Zheng was furious. “He will grow up to be a dissolute rake,” he said, and from that day on he didn’t love him. But Grandmother Jia dotes on him.’\n\nYu-cun laughed:\n\n‘It is very wrong to judge people by the standards of commonplace morality! Probably not one in ten of the great names of history would stand up to such scrutiny. It is precisely because of their unconventionality that these people are remembered. I was brought up, I may say, in circumstances of great hardship. When I was a candidate for the Provincial Examination and was staying in the capital, I made the acquaintance of a number of good family who had the reputation of being cultured and public-spirited men. There was one among them whose character was quite outstanding. But because he refused to be like the common run of profiteers and place-seekers, no one understood him, with the result that people who didn’t know him very well all made up their minds that he must be a drunken, good-for-nothing oaf. I remember one day on which I was able to observe for myself a scene in which he was reviling the great ones of the world and praising the poor and humble which showed a degree of insight and understanding that one would hardly have credited to a boy of thirteen or fourteen. It was obvious that here was someone who, if only he had the chance, would in later life be a fine, upstanding citizen and a credit to his country. But unfortunately, as the world is constituted, such people get no encouragement. He is now a young man in his twenties, but because his family is poor and he has no influential connections, he has not yet been able to make his mark. It is a great pity.’\n\nHe sighed.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Zi-xing. ‘The Jias have several young ladies who are very well worth knowing. To say nothing of Lady Jia and the two daughters-in-law. But there is one of the Jia daughters-in-law’s younger sisters who is really something special. Her name is Wang Xi-feng. She is only just twenty and is already a very capable and experienced manager. Her looks, too, are quite out of the common run. As for your young friend, I think I know the one you mean. There is no need to look any further. It is he. But there is another young man in Nanking who is very much the same as your young friend. He is also the son of a very noble family. His name is Zhen Bao-yu. He is exactly the same age as your young friend and is equally eccentric. I have often wondered if it was not the same person.’\n\n‘No,’ said Yu-cun, ‘it would be very unusual for two such boys to exist at the same time. Probably the same magnetic forces which produced the one have been at work to produce the other. There is nothing very surprising about that. I should like to meet this other one some time.’\n\n‘They are so alike,’ said Zi-xing, ‘that even their grandmothers dote on them to the same degree. But I don’t think I have told you yet about the Jias’ other young ladies. Because your esteemed employer, Mr Lin, is married to Lady Jia’s daughter, this Miss Lin is now living with the Jias in the Rong-guo mansion. She is treated with great consideration, and as she is extremely intelligent and has good looks as well, the Jias all think very highly of her.’\n\nYu-cun nodded:\n\n‘Yes, I believe my employer did have a daughter, but she lost her mother when she was very young, and as her father is now getting on in years and has no one else to look after her, it was natural that she should be sent to her grandmother’s. It also explains why you and I never saw her when we were there.’\n\nAfter a little more conversation they rose from the table, the bill was paid, and they went their separate ways.\n\nHis younger sister, Chia Min, was your pupil’s mother. If you don’t believe me, go back and make further inquiries.”\n\nYutsun clapped his hands. “Of course,” he cried. “No wonder my pupil always pronounces min as mi and skips a stroke when writing it. That had puzzled me, but now you’ve explained the reason. I thought there was something uncommon about the child, and this proves it. She must take after her mother. But since she’s the grand-daughter of the Duke of Jungkuo, that’s only to be expected. It’s a pity her mother died last month.”\n\n“My three younger sisters are all gone,” he sighed. “Not one is left of the elder generation. We’ll have to see what the younger generation is like.”\n\n“Yes, just now you mentioned Cheng’s son who was born with jade, and the posthumous son of his elder brother. But hasn’t Lord Sheh any son?”\n\n“After Cheng had this son with the jade, his wife had another who is still too young to judge. So he has two sons and a grandson, but there’s no telling how they will turn out. Lord Sheh has a son called Chia Lien who is over twenty now. He married a relative, the niece of his uncle Cheng’s wife Lady Wang, and they have been married for four or five years. This Chia Lien has purchased the rank of a sub-prefect. He’s another of your cynical, unconventional sort, a smooth talker and a good mixer, so he’s staying with his uncle Cheng to help run the household. Since his marriage, though, his wife has stolen all his thunder. She’s extremely good-looking and as plausible as she is capable — a wife in a thousand.”\n\n“That bears out what I said,” remarked Yutsun. “All the people we’ve been discussing are probably the same in that, whether good or bad. We can’t judge them by ordinary standards.”\n\n“Never mind whether they’re good or bad, and stop sizing up other people. Have a drink.”\n\n“I’m talking so much I’m forgetting to drink.”\n\n“Talking about other people is a good way to pass the time while drinking. What does it matter if we drink a little more?” Yutsun looked out of the window.\n\n“It’s late,” he remarked. “We must be careful not to get shut out of the city. Let’s go back slowly and talk as we go.”\n\nThey got up and paid the bill. They were on the point of leaving when a voice from behind called:\n\n“Congratulations, Brother Yutsun! I’ve come to bring you good news.” Yutsun turned quickly.... To know who it was, read the next chapter."
