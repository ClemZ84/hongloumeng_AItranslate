  "original": "却说贾政先前曾将房产并大观园奏请入官，内廷不收，又无人居住，只好封锁。因园子接连尤氏、惜春住宅，太觉旷阔无人，遂将包勇罚看荒园。此时贾政理家，奉了贾母之命，将人口渐次减少，诸凡省俭，尚且不能支持。幸喜凤姐是贾母心爱的人，王夫人等虽不大喜欢，若说治家办事，尚能出力，所以内事仍交凤姐办理。但近来因被抄以后，诸事运用不来，也是每形拮据。那些房头上下人等原是宽裕惯了的，如今较往日十去其七，怎能周到？不免怨言不绝。凤姐也不敢推辞，在贾母前扶病承欢。过了些时，贾赦、贾珍各到当差地方，恃有用度，暂且自安。写书回家，都言安逸，家中不必挂念。于是贾母放心，邢夫人、尤氏也略略宽怀。\n　　一日，史湘云出嫁回门，来贾母这边请安。贾母提起他女婿甚好，史湘云也将那里家中平安的话说了，请老太太放心，又提起黛玉去世，不免大家落泪。贾母又想起迎春苦楚，越觉悲伤起来。史湘云解劝一回，又到各家请安问好毕，仍到贾母房中安歇。言及薛家这样人家，“被薛大哥闹的家破人亡，今年虽是缓决人犯，明年不知可能减等？”贾母道：“你还不知道呢：昨儿蟠儿媳妇死的不明白，几乎又闹出一场事来。还幸亏老佛爷有眼，叫他带来的丫头自己供出来了，那夏奶奶没的闹了，自家拦住相验，你姨妈这里才将皮裹肉的打发出去了。如今守着蝌儿过日子。这孩子却有良心，他说哥哥在监里尚没完事，不肯娶亲。你邢妹妹在大太太那边，也就很苦。琴姑娘为他公公死了还没满服，梅家尚未娶去。你说说，真真‘六亲同运’。薛家是这么着；二太太的娘家大舅太爷一死，凤丫头的哥哥也不成人；那二舅太爷是个小气的，又是官项不清，也是打饥荒，甄家自从抄家以后，别无信息。”湘云道：“三姐姐去了，曾有书字回来么？”贾母道：“自从出了嫁，二老爷回来说，你三姐姐在海疆很好。只是没有书信，我也是日夜惦记。为我们家连连的出些不好事，所以我也顾不来。如今四丫头也没有给他提亲。环儿呢，谁有功夫提起他来？如今我们家的日子比你从前在这里的时候更苦了。只可怜你宝姐姐，自过了门，没过一天舒服日子。你二哥哥还是那么疯疯颠颠，这怎么好呢！\n　　湘云道：“我从小儿在这里长大的，这里那些人的脾气，我都知道的。这一回来了，竟都改了样子了。我打量我隔了好些时没来，他们生疏我；我细想起来，竟不是的。就是见了我，瞧他们的意思，原要象先一样的热闹，不知道怎么说说就伤起心来了，所以我坐了坐儿就到老太太这里来了。”贾母道：“如今的日子在我也罢了，他们年轻轻儿的人，还了得。我正要想个法儿，叫他们还热闹一天才好，只是打不起这个精神来。”湘云道：“我想起来了，宝姐姐不是后儿的生日吗？我多住一天，给他拜个寿，大家热闹一天。不知老太太怎么样？”贾母道：“我真正气糊涂了。你不提我竟忘了。后日可不是他的生日吗！我明日拿出钱来，给他办个生日。他没有定亲的时候，倒做过好几次，如今过了门倒没有做。宝玉这孩子，头里很伶俐，很淘气；如今因为家里的事不好，把这孩越发弄的话都没有了。倒是珠儿媳妇还好。他有的时候是这么着，没的时候他也是这么着，带着兰儿静静儿的过日子，倒难为他。”湘云道：“别人还不离，独有琏二嫂子，连模样儿都改了，说话也不伶俐了。明日等我来引逗他们，看他们怎么样。但只他们嘴里不说，心里要抱怨我，说我有了……”刚说到这里，却把个脸飞红了。贾母会意道：“这怕什么？当初妹妹们都是在一处乐惯了的，说说笑笑，再别留这些心。大凡一个人有也罢没也罢，总要受得富贵、耐得贫贱才好呢。你宝姐姐生来是个大方的人。头里他家这样好，他也一点儿不骄傲；后来他家坏了事，他也是舒舒坦坦的。如今在我家里，宝玉待他好，他也是那样安顿；一时待他不好，也不见他有什么烦恼。我看这孩子倒是个有福的。你林姐姐他就最小性儿，又多心，所以到底儿不长命的。凤丫头也见过些事，很不该略见些风波就改了样子。他若这样没见识，也就是小器了。后儿宝丫头的生日，我另拿出银子来，热热闹闹的给他做个生日，也叫他喜欢这么一天。”湘云答应着：“老太太说的很是。索性把那些姐妹们都请了来，大家叙一叙。”贾母道：“自然要请的。”一时高兴，遂叫鸳鸯拿出一百银子来，交给外头：“叫他明日起，预备两天的酒饭。”鸳鸯领命，叫婆子交了出去，一宿无话。\n　　次日传话出去，打发人去接迎春，又请了薛姨妈、宝琴，叫带了香菱来，又请李婶娘，不多半日，李纹、李绮都来了。宝钗本不知道，听见老太太的丫头来请，说：“薛姨太太来了，请二奶奶过去呢。”宝钗心里喜欢，便是随身衣服过去，要见他母亲。只见妹子宝琴并香菱都在这里，又见李婶娘等人也都来了，心想：“那些人必是知道我们家的事情完了，所以来问候的。”便去问了李婶娘好，见了贾母，然后与他母亲说了几句话，和李家姐妹们问好。\n　　湘云在旁说道：“太太们请都坐下，让我们姐妹们给姐姐拜寿。”宝钗听了，倒呆了一呆，回来一想：“可不是明日是我的生日吗？”便说：“姐妹们过来瞧老太太是该的，若说为我的生日，是断断不敢的。”正推让着，宝玉也来请薛姨妈、李婶娘的安。听见宝钗自己推让，他心里本早打算过宝钗生日，因家中闹得七颠八倒，也不敢在贾母处提起。今儿湘云等众人要拜寿，便喜欢道：“明日才是生日，我正要告诉老太太来。”湘云笑道：“扯臊，老太太还等你告诉？你打量这些人为什么来？是老太太请的。”宝钗听了，心下未信，只听贾母合他母亲道：“可怜宝丫头做了一年新媳妇，家用接二连三的有事，总没有给他做过生日，今日我给他做个生日，请姨太太、太太们来，大家说说话儿。”薛姨妈道：“老太太这些时心里才安，他小人儿家还没有孝敬老太太，倒要老太太操心。”湘云道：“老太太最疼的孙子是二哥哥，难道二嫂子就不疼了么？况且宝姐姐也配老太太给他做生日。”宝钗低头不语。宝玉心里想道：“我只说史妹妹出了阁必换了一个人了，我所以不敢亲近他，他也不来理我；如今听他的话，竟和先前是一样的。为什么我们那个过了门，更觉的腼腆了，话都说不出来了呢？”正想着，小丫头进来说：“二姑奶奶回来了。”随后李纨、凤姐都进来，大家厮见一番。迎春提起他父亲出门，说：“本要赶来见见，只是他拦着不许来，说是咱们家正是晦气时候，不要沾染在身上。我扭不过，没有来，直哭了两三天。”凤姐道：“今儿为什么肯放你回来？”迎春道：“他又说咱们家二老爷又袭了职，还可以走走，不妨事的，所以才放我来。”说着又哭起来。贾母道：“我原为闷的慌，今日接你们来给孙子媳妇过生日，说说笑笑，解个闷儿，你们又提起这些烦事来，又招起我的烦恼来了。”迎春等都不敢作声了。\n　　凤姐虽勉强说了几句有兴的话，终不似先前爽利、招人发笑。贾母心里要宝钗喜欢，故意的怄凤姐儿说话。凤姐也知贾母之意，便竭力张罗，说道：“今儿老太太喜欢些了。你看这些人好几时没有聚在一处，今儿齐全。”说着，回过头去，看见婆婆、尤氏不在这里，又缩住了口。贾母为着“齐全”两字，也想邢夫人等，叫人请去。邢夫人、尤氏、惜春等听见老太太叫，不敢不来，心内也十分不愿意、想着家业零败，偏又高兴给宝钗做生日，到底老太太偏心，便来了也是无精打彩的。贾母问起岫烟来，邢夫人假说病着不来。贾母会意，知薛姨妈在这里有些不便，也不提了。\n　　一时摆下果酒。贾母说：“也不送到外头，今日只许咱们娘儿们乐一乐。”宝玉虽然娶过亲的人，因贾母疼爱，仍在里头打混，但不与湘云、宝琴等同席，便在贾母身旁设着一个坐儿，他替宝钗轮流敬酒。贾母道：“如今且坐下，大家喝酒。到挨晚儿再到各处行礼去。若如今行起礼来，大家又闹规矩，把我的兴头打回去，就没趣了。”宝钗便依言坐下。贾母又向众人道：“咱们今儿索性洒脱些，各留一两个人伺候。我叫鸳鸯带了彩云、莺儿、袭人、平儿等在后间去也喝一钟酒。”鸳鸯等说：“我们还没有给二奶奶磕头，怎么就好喝酒去呢？”贾母道：“我说了，你们只管去。用的着你们再来。”鸳鸯等去了。这里贾母才让薛姨妈等喝酒。见他们都不是往常的样子，贾母着急道：“你们到底是怎么着？大家高兴些才好。”湘云道：“我们又吃又喝，还要怎么着呢？”凤姐道：“他们小的时候都高兴，如今碍着脸不敢混说，所以老太太瞧着冷净了。”宝玉轻轻的告诉贾母道：“话是没有什么说的，再说就说到不好的上头去了。不如老太太出个主意，叫他们行个令儿罢。”贾母侧着耳朵听了，笑道：“若是行令，又得叫鸳鸯去。”\n　　宝玉听了，不待再说，就出席到后间去找鸳鸯，说：“老太太要行令，叫姐姐去呢。”鸳鸯道：“小爷，让我们舒舒服服的喝一钟罢。何苦来，又来搅什么？”宝玉道：“当真老太太说的，叫你去呢。与我什么相干？”鸳鸯没法，说道：“你们只管喝，我去了就来。”便到贾母那边。老太太道：“你来了么？这里要行令呢。”鸳鸯道：“听见宝二爷说老太太叫我，才来的。不知老太太要行什么令儿？”贾母道：“那文的怪闷的慌，武的又不好，你倒是想个新鲜玩意儿才好。”鸳鸯想了想道：“如今姨太太有了年纪，不肯费心，倒不如拿出令盆骰子来，大家掷个曲牌名儿赌输赢酒罢。”贾母道：“这也使得。”便命人取骰盆放在案上。鸳鸯说：“如今用四个骰子掷去，掷不出名儿来的罚一杯，掷出名儿来，每人喝酒的杯数儿，掷出来再定。”众人听了道：“这是容易的，我们都随着。”鸳鸯便打点儿。众人叫鸳鸯喝了一杯，就在他身上数起，恰是薛姨妈先掷。薛姨妈便掷了一下，却是四个么。鸳鸯道：“这是有名的，叫做‘商山四皓’。有年纪的喝一杯。”于是贾母、李婶娘、邢、王两夫人都该喝。贾母举酒要喝，鸳鸯道：“这是姨太太掷的，还该姨太太说个曲牌名儿，下家接一句‘千家诗’。说不出来的罚一杯。”薛姨妈道：“你又来算计我了，我那里说的上来？”贾母道：“不说到底寂寞，还是说一句的好。下家儿就是我了，若说不出来，我陪姨太太喝一钟就是了。”薛姨妈便道：“我说个‘临老入花丛’。”贾母点点头儿道：“‘将谓偷闲学少年’。”\n　　说完，骰盆过到李纹，便掷了两个四，两个二。鸳鸯说：“也有名儿了，这叫‘刘阮入天台’。”李纹便接着说了个“二士入桃源”。下手儿便是李纨，说道：“‘寻得桃花好避秦’。”大家又喝了一口。\n　　骰盆又过到贾母跟前，便掷了两个二，两个三。贾母道：“这要喝酒了。”鸳鸯道：“有名儿的，这是‘江南引雏’。众人都该喝一杯。”凤姐道：“雏是雏，倒飞了好些了。”众人瞅了他一眼，凤姐便不言语。贾母道：“我说什么呢？‘公领孙’罢。”下手是李绮，便说道：“‘闲看儿童捉柳花’。”众人都说好。\n　　宝玉巴不得要说、只是令盆轮不到，正想着，恰好到了跟前，便掷了一个二，两个三，一个么，便说道：“这是什么？”鸳鸯笑道：“这是个‘臭’！先喝一钟再掷罢。”宝玉只得喝了又掷。这一掷掷了两个三，两个四。鸳鸯道：“有了，这叫做‘张敞画眉’。”宝玉知是打趣他。宝钗的脸也飞红了。凤姐不大懂得，还说：“二兄弟快说了，再找下家儿是谁。”宝玉难说，自认：“罚了罢。我也没下家儿。”\n　　过了令盆，轮到李纨，便掷了一下。鸳鸯道：“大奶奶掷的是‘十二金钗’。”宝玉听了，赶到李纨身旁看时，只见红绿对开，便说：“这一个好看的很。”忽然想起“十二钗”的梦来，便呆呆的退到自己座上，心里想：“这‘十二钗’说是金陵的，怎么我家这些人，如今七大八小的就剩了这几个？”复又看看湘云、宝钗，虽说都在，只是不见了黛玉。一时按捺不住，眼泪便要下来，恐人看见，便说身上燥的很，脱脱衣裳去，挂了筹出席去了。史湘云看见宝玉这般光景，打量宝玉掷不出好的来，被别人掷了去，心里不喜欢才去的；又嫌那个令儿没趣，便有些烦。只见李纨道：“我不说了。席间的人也不齐，不如罚我一杯。”\n　　贾母道：“这个令儿也不热闹，不如蠲了罢。让鸳鸯掷一下，看掷出个什么来。”小丫头把令盆放在鸳鸯跟前。鸳鸯依命，便掷了两个二，一个五，那一个骰子在盆里只管转。鸳鸯叫道：“不要五！＂那骰子单单转出一个五来。鸳鸯道：“了不得！我输了。”贾母道：“这是不算什么的吗？”鸳鸯道：“名儿倒有，只是我说不上曲牌名来。”贾母道：“你说名儿，我给你诌。”鸯鸯道：“这是‘浪扫浮萍’。”贾母道：“这也不难，我替你说个‘秋鱼入菱窠’。”鸳鸯下手的就是湘云，便道：“‘白萍吟尽楚江秋’。”众人都道：“这句很确。”\n　　贾母道：“这令完了，咱们喝两杯，吃饭罢。”回头一看，见宝玉还没进来，便问道：“宝玉那里去了，还不来？”鸳鸯道：“换衣裳去了。”贾母道：“谁跟了去的？”那莺儿便上来回道：“我看见二爷出去，我叫袭人姐姐跟了去了。”贾母王夫人才放心。等了一回，王夫人叫人去找。小丫头到了新房子里，只见五儿在那里插蜡。小丫头便问：“宝二爷那里去了？”五儿道：“在老太太那边喝酒呢。”小丫头道：“我打老太太那里来，太太叫我来找，岂有在那里倒叫我来找的呢。”五儿道：“这就不知道了，你到别处找去罢。”小丫头没法，只得回来，遇见秋纹，问道：“你见二爷那里去了？”秋纹道：“我也找他，太太们等他吃饭。这会子那里去了呢？你快去回老太太去，不必说不在家，只说喝了酒不大受用，不吃饭了，略躺一躺再来，请老太太、太太们吃饭罢。”小丫头依言回去，告诉珍珠，珍珠回了贾母。贾母道：“他本来吃不多，不吃也罢了，叫他歇歇罢。告诉他今儿不必过来，有他媳妇在这里就是了。”珍珠便向小丫头道：“你听见了？”小丫头答应着，不便说明，只得在别处转了一转，说“告诉了”。众人也不理会，吃毕饭，大家散坐闲话，不提。\n　　且说宝玉一时伤心，走出米，正无主意。只见袭人赶来，问是怎么了。宝玉道：“不怎么，只是心里怪烦的。要不趁他们喝酒，咱们两个到珍大奶奶那里逛逛去。”袭人道：“珍大奶奶在这里，去找谁？”宝玉道：“不找谁，瞧瞧他，既在这里，住的房屋怎么样。”袭人只得跟着，一面走，一面说。走到尤氏那边，又一个小门儿半开半掩，宝玉也不进去。只见看园门的两个婆子坐在门槛上说话儿。宝玉问道：“这小门儿开门么？”婆子道：“天天不开。今儿有人出来说，今日预备老太太要用园里的果子，才开着门等着呢。”宝玉便慢慢的走到那边，果见腰门半开。宝玉才要进去，袭人忙拉住道：“不用去。园里不干净，常没有人去，别再撞见什么。”宝玉仗着酒气，说道：“我不怕那些，”袭人苦苦的拉住，不容他去。婆子们上来说道：“如今这园子安静的了。自从那日道士拿了妖去，我们摘花儿，打果子，一个人常走的。二爷要去，咱们都跟着，有这些人怕什么。”宝玉喜欢。袭人也不便相强，只得跟着。\n　　宝玉进得园来，只见满目凄凉。那些花木枯萎，更有几处亭馆，彩色久经剥落。远远望见一丛翠竹，倒还茂盛。宝玉一想，说：“我自病时出园，住在后边，一连几个月不准我到这里，瞬息荒凉。你看独有那几竿翠竹菁葱，这不是潇湘馆么？”袭人道：“你几个月没来，连方向儿都忘了。咱们只管说话儿，不觉将怡红院走过了。”回头用手指着道：“这才是潇湘馆呢。”宝玉顺着袭人的手一瞧，道：“可不是过了吗？咱们回去瞧瞧。”袭人道：“天晚了，老太太必是等着吃饭，该回去了。”宝玉不言，找着旧路，竟往前走。你道宝玉虽离了大观园将及一载，岂遂忘了路径？只因袭人怕他见了潇湘馆，想起黛玉，又要伤心，所以要用言混过。后来见宝玉只望里走，只怕他招了邪气，所以哄着他，只说已经走过了。那里知道宝玉的心全在潇湘馆上。此时宝玉往前急走，袭人只得赶上。见他站着，似有所见，如有所闻，便道：“你听什么？”宝玉道：“潇湘馆倒有人住么？”袭人道：“大约没有人罢。”宝玉道：“我明明听见有人在内啼哭，怎么没有人？”袭人道：“是你疑心。素常你到这里，常听见林姑娘伤心，所以如今还是那样。”宝玉不信，还要听去。婆子们赶上说道：“二爷快回去罢，天已晚了。别处我们还敢走走；这里路儿隐僻，又听见人说，这里打林姑娘死后，常听见有哭声，所以人都不敢走的。”宝玉、袭人听说，都吃了一惊。宝玉道：“可不是？”说着，便滴下泪来，说：“林妹妹，林妹妹！好好儿的，是我害了你！你别怨我，只是父母作主，并不是我负心！”愈说愈痛，便大哭起来。袭人正在没法，只见秋纹带着些人赶来，对袭人道：“你好大胆子！怎么和二爷到这里来？老太太、太太急的打发人各处都找到了。刚才腰门上有人说是你和二爷到这里来了，唬的老太太、太太们了不得，骂着我叫我带人赶来。还不快回去呢。”宝玉犹自痛哭，袭人也不顾他哭，两个人拉着就走，一面替他拭眼泪，告诉他老太太着急。宝玉没法，只得回来。\n　　袭人知老太太不放心，将宝玉仍送到贾母那边，众人都等着未散。贾母便说：“袭人！我素常因你明白，才把宝玉交给你，怎么今儿带他园里去？他的病才好，倘或撞着什么，又闹起来，那可怎么好？”袭人也不敢分辩，只得低头不语。宝钗看宝玉颜色不好，心里着实的吃惊。倒还是宝玉恐袭人受委屈，说道：“青天白日怕什么？我因为好些时没到园里逛逛，今儿趁着酒兴走走，那里就撞着什么了呢？”凤姐在园里吃过大亏的，听到那里，寒毛直竖，说：“宝兄弟胆子忒大了。”湘云道：“不是胆大，倒是心实。不知是会芙蓉神去了，还是寻什么仙去了。”宝玉听着，也不答言。独有王夫人急的一言不发。贾母问道：“你到园里没有唬着呀？不用说了。以后要逛，到底多带几个人才好。不是你闹的，大家早散了。去罢，好好的睡一夜，明儿一早过来，我要找补，叫你们再乐一天呢。别为他又闹出什么原故来。”众人听说遂辞了贾母出来。薛姨妈便到土夫人那里住下，史湘云仍在贾母房中，迎春便往惜春那里去了。馀者各自回去不提。独有宝玉回到房中，嗳声叹气。宝钗明知其故，也不理他。只是怕他忧闷勾出旧病来，便进里间，叫袭人来，细问他宝玉到园怎么样的光景。\n未知袭人怎么回说，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Now Jia Zheng had previously requested that their property and the Garden of Grand View be confiscated by the throne, but the Inner Court had not taken them over. As the houses were unoccupied, they had to be locked up. Because the Garden adjoined the residences of Madam You and Xichun, it seemed too large and deserted, so Bao Yong was assigned to keep watch there as a punishment.\n\nJia Zheng, now in charge of the household, was carrying out the Lady Dowager’s instructions to reduce the staff gradually and cut down expenses in every way. Yet even so they could not make both ends meet. Luckily Xifeng was the old lady’s favourite. Though Lady Wang and the rest had no great liking for her, she was still able to manage affairs; so the internal household was left in her hands. But since the confiscation of their property she had no means of raising money, and was hard pressed too. All the servants, high and low, were used to living in luxury; and now that their numbers had been cut by seventy per cent, how could they have all they wanted? Complaints were heard every day. Xifeng did not dare plead illness but had to do her best despite her sickness to please the old lady.\n\nAfter some time, Jia She and Jia Zhen reached their posts where they had certain resources and so could live at ease for the time being. They wrote home that they were comfortable and the family need not worry about them. This set the Lady Dowager’s mind at rest, and Lady Xing and Madam You too felt somewhat relieved.\n\nOne day, Xiangyun came back after her marriage to pay a respects to her family. She called first on the Lady Dowager, who spoke well of her son-in-law. Xiangyun assured her that all was well in her new home and she had no worries, then spoke of Daiyu’s death which reduced them all to tears. The thought of Yingchun’s wretchedness now made the old lady even more upset. Xiangyun did her best to console her. After calling on the rest of the family she came back to spend the night in the Lady Dowager’s apartments. They spoke of the Xue family’s ruin by Xue Pan.\n\n“This year his sentence has been postponed; but who knows whether it may be commuted next year or not?” asked Xiangyun.\n\n“Don’t you know?” said the old lady. “Pan’s wife died a strange death yesterday, and that nearly caused more trouble. Luckily the Bodhisattva showed us the way — the truth was confessed by her own maid, so Mrs. Xia couldn’t make a scene and stopped the coroner from holding an inquest. Your aunt Xue just managed to scrape together enough for the funeral by the skin of her teeth. Now she’s living with Ke. That boy has a conscience. He says he won’t marry until his brother’s case is settled. And your cousin in Aunt Xing’s place is having a wretched time too. Because Miss Qin is still in mourning for her father, the Mei family haven’t married her yet. As the saying goes, when one family’s in trouble, the whole clan suffers. That’s the way it is with the Xues. After the elder uncle of Lady Wang’s family died, Xifeng’s brother Wang Ren went to the bad. Her other uncle is a petty miser, and because of public funds he embezzled he’s in debt too. And since the Zhen family’s property was confiscated we’ve had no news of them.”\n\n“Hasn’t Third Sister written home since she left?” Xiangyun asked.\n\n“After her marriage, the Second Master came back and told us that your third sister was all right on the coast,” replied the old lady. “But we’ve had no letter from her, and I think of her day and night. Because so many dreadful things have happened to our family, I haven’t been able to attend to everything. Now no one has found a husband for Fourth Girl, and who has time to bother about Huan? Our life is harder now than in your day. I’m only sorry for your Cousin Baochai. Since her marriage she’s not had a single day of ease; and your Cousin Baoyu is still so crazy, what’s to be done?”\n\nXiangyun said, “I grew up here and I know the ways of all the inmates. Coming back this time, they seem to me quite changed. At first I thought they were standing on ceremony because I’d been away so long; but thinking it over, that can’t be the reason. When they saw me, they wanted to be as merry as in the old days; yet somehow, when we started talking, they looked most upset. So after sitting a little while I came over to you, madam.”\n\nThe old lady said, “The way we live now...”\n\n\"All right, they're young and have their whole lives ahead of them. I've been meaning to find some way to give them a day's fun, only I haven't the energy.\"\n\n\"I know!\" said Xiangyun. \"Isn't Cousin Baochai's birthday the day after tomorrow? If I stay on another day to wish her a happy birthday, we can all have some fun together. How about that, madam?\"\n\n\"I'm so upset, I'd clean forgotten if you hadn't reminded me. The day after tomorrow is her birthday! I'll give you money tomorrow to prepare a celebration for her. Before she was betrothed we celebrated it several times, but not since her marriage. Baoyu used to be so bright and lively, such a mischievous boy; but now, because of this trouble in our family, he's been reduced to a simpleton. His elder brother's wife is the only one who's all right. Whether she had anything or not, she'd be the same -- living quietly with Lan. It hasn't been easy for her.\"\n\n\"The others aren't too bad, but even Second Sister Xifeng has changed, not just her looks but the way she talks. Tomorrow I'll try to amuse them and see how they take it. They may not say anything, but I'm sure they'll complain that now that I'm married....\"\n\nShe broke off, blushing.\n\nThe Lady Dowager knew what she meant. \"Why should that matter?\" she asked. \"You girls were used to having fun together, laughing and joking; so don't start being so sensitive. Whether one has anything or not, one should be able to take good times or bad. Baochai has always been good-natured. When her family was well off she wasn't the least bit proud; then after their reverse she took it calmly. Now that she's here, if Baoyu is good to her she's composed; if he neglects her, she doesn't seem to worry either. I consider her a very fortunate young woman. As for your Cousin Daiyu, she was too thin-skinned and sensitive, and that's why she didn't live long. Xifeng has seen a good deal of life, she shouldn't change just because of this little set-back. If she's really so narrow-minded, that shows how petty she is. I'll give special funds for Baochai's birthday the day after tomorrow, and we'll have a lively celebration to cheer her up.\"\n\n\"Quite right, madam,\" agreed Xiangyun. \"Why not invite all the girls too for a reunion?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nIn high good humour now she told Yuanyang to fetch a hundred taels of silver and send it to the accountants' office to prepare two days's feasts. Yuanyang assented and ordered an old serving-woman to take the silver. And nothing more happened that night.\n\nThe next day, orders were sent to fetch Yingchun and invite Aunt Xue and Baoqin, who was to bring Xiangling. Mrs. Li was invited too, and in less than half a day Li Wen and Li Qi arrived. Baochai, who knew nothing about this, was asked over by the old lady's maid.\n\n\"Aunt Xue is here,\" she was told. \"Will you please go over, madam?\"\n\nBaochai, delighted, went in her ordinary clothes to see her mother. She found her younger sister Baoqin and Xiangling there as well as Mrs. Li and her two daughters.\n\n\"They must have heard that our family's troubles are over and come to offer congratulations,\" she thought.\n\nHaving greeted Mrs. Li and paid her respects to the Lady Dowager, she exchanged a few words with her mother and greeted Li Wen and Li Qi.\n\nXiangyun, who was nearby, suggested, \"Will all the ladies please be seated and let us wish my sister a happy birthday?\"\n\nThis took Baochai by surprise, but after a second thought she realized, \"Why, yes, tomorrow is my birthday.\"\n\nShe said, \"When you called on the old lady you should have come to see me too.\"\n\n\"If you mean for my birthday, I certainly don’t deserve it.” While she was protesting, Baoyu came to pay his respects to Aunt Xue and Aunt Li. He had long been thinking of Baochai’s birthday, but because of the recent upheavals in the household had not ventured to mention it to his grandmother. Now that Xiangyun and the others had come to offer congratulations, he exclaimed happily:\n\n“So her birthday’s tomorrow! I was just going to tell the old lady.”\n\n“What nonsense,” said Xiangyun. “As if she needed you to tell her! Why do you think we’re here? The old lady invited us.”\n\nBaochai, not altogether convinced, heard the Lady Dowager say to her mother, “My poor Baochai has been married a whole year, but with one thing after another happening we’ve not celebrated her birthday yet. So today I’m giving her a birthday party and have invited your good self and the other ladies to come for a chat.”\n\nAunt Xue answered, “Your Ladyship has only just recovered, yet instead of this child showing her devotion to you, you’re putting yourself out for her.”\n\n“My second grandson is my favourite,” said the old lady, “so of course I dote on his wife too. Besides, Baochai deserves this.”\n\nBaochai lowered her head without replying.\n\nBaoyu reflected, “I thought that after Cousin Shi’s marriage she would have changed, and that’s why I didn’t dare approach her and she ignored me. But from the way she talks, she’s exactly the same as before. Why is it that after our marriage my wife has become so shy and silent?”\n\nHe was mulling this over when a maid announced, “Miss Yingchun is back.” Then Li Wan and Xifeng came in, and they all exchanged greetings.\n\nYingchun mentioned that her father was going away. “I wanted to come to see you,” she said, “but he wouldn’t let me, saying our family’s in bad luck and I mustn’t come here to be contaminated. I couldn’t get my way, so I didn’t come, and cried for two or three days.”\n\nXifeng asked, “Why has he let you come today then?”\n\n“Now he says that as Uncle Zheng has inherited the title it’s all right for me to pay a short visit, so he let me come.” At that she burst into tears again.\n\n“I was feeling depressed and invited you here today to celebrate my grandson’s wife’s birthday, hoping to have some fun to cheer up,” said the Lady Dowager. “But instead you bring up these wretched things which upset me again.”\n\nYingchun and the others dared say no more.\n\nXifeng made an effort to crack a few jokes, but she was not her usual sparkling self. The old lady, wanting to please Baochai, deliberately egged Xifeng on; and Xifeng, knowing her intention, did her best to enliven the party.\n\n“The old lady is in better spirits today,” she said. “Look how all of us have gathered here — it’s a long time since that happened.”\n\nShe turned then and, not seeing her mother-in-law or Madam You present, broke off. The reference to a gathering reminded the Lady Dowager of Lady Xing, and she sent to invite her. Lady Xing, Madam You and Xichun dared not refuse the summons, though they came most unwillingly, reflecting that the family was going to rack and ruin yet the old lady was in the mood to celebrate Baochai’s birthday — she was obviously partial to her. So they looked most unenthusiastic. When the Lady Dowager asked after Xiuyan, Lady Xing made the excuse that she was unwell. The old lady knew that she stayed away because Aunt Xue was there, and said no more.\n\nSoon wine and dishes were served.\n\n“Don’t serve the men outside,” said the Lady Dowager. “Today we women are going to enjoy ourselves.”\n\nAlthough Baoyu was married, because of his grandmother’s fondness for him he was allowed to join the women instead of feasting outside with the men. But he did not sit at the same table as Xiangyun and Baoqin, a seat being placed for him next to the old lady so that he could help Baochai offer round the wine.\n\n“Do sit down now and let’s have some wine,” she said. “We can go later to pay our respects in the different apartments. If we start doing that now, there’ll be so much fuss and formality it will spoil my fun — that would be too bad.” So Baochai did as she was told and sat down.\n\nThe Lady Dowager told the others, “Let’s make today free and easy. Each of you just keep one or two attendants. I’ll tell Yuanyang to take Caiyun, Yinger, Xiren and Ping’er to the inner room to have some wine too.”\n\nYuanyang and the others demurred, “We haven’t yet paid our respects to Madam Lian, so how can we go off to drink?”\n\n“Do as I say,” said the old lady. “I’ll call you if you’re needed.” So then Yuanyang and the others left.\n\nThe Lady Dowager now urged Aunt Xue and the rest to drink. Noticing that they seemed constrained, unlike their usual selves, she asked in surprise, “What’s the matter with you today? Do cheer up!”\n\n“We’re eating and drinking — what more do you want?” asked Xiangyun.\n\nXifeng explained, “When they were younger they enjoyed themselves more; but now they’re too inhibited to talk nonsense, and that makes the party seem rather quiet, madam.”\n\nBaoyu whispered to his grandmother, “They’ve nothing to say, and if they do speak out it may be tactless. Why don’t you suggest some drinking game, madam?”\n\nThe old lady inclined her head to hear better, then chuckled, “If we play a drinking game we shall have to fetch Yuanyang back.”\n\nWithout waiting for more, Baoyu left the table and went to the inner room. “The old lady wants to play a drinking game and wants you to take charge, sister,” he said.\n\nYuanyang retorted, “Master Bao, do let us drink in peace. Why come to disturb us again?”\n\n“It’s true, the old lady sent me to fetch you. What’s it to do with me?”\n\nYuanyang had to give in. “You go on drinking,” she said. “I’ll be back presently.” She went over to the other apartment.\n\n“So you’ve come,” said the Lady Dowager. “We want to play a drinking game here.”\n\n“I came because Master Bao said you sent for me, madam. What game would you like to play?”\n\n“Those literary games are too dull, and the boisterous ones are no good either. You must think up some fun new game.”\n\nAfter a little thought Yuanyang said, “As Aunt Xue is getting on in years and doesn’t like to have to think too hard, why not get out the dice-box and dice, and we can throw the dice in turn to see who has to drink?”\n\n“Very well,” agreed the Lady Dowager, and ordered the dice-box to be brought and placed on the table.\n\nYuanyang explained, “We’ll go by what four dice show. If they don’t make a name, the thrower has to drink a cup; if they do, then the number of cups the others have to drink will depend on the throw.”\n\n“That’s simple. We’ll do as you say,” they replied.\n\nYuanyang cast the dice to decide where to start counting from, and the company made her drink a cup of wine first. Then they started counting round from her, and it turned out that Aunt Xue should be the first to throw. She shook the dice and they turned up four aces.\n\n“This is called ‘Four Gallants of Mount Shang,’” announced Yuanyang. “All the elderly ladies must drink.”\n\nSo the Lady Dowager, Aunt Li and Lady Xing and Lady Wang had to drink. As the Lady Dowager raised her cup to her lips Yuanyang said, “As the dice were thrown by Aunt Xue, she must quote the name of a melody and the next player must recite a line from ‘Poems by a Thousand Authors.’ Anyone who fails must drink a cup.”\n\n“You’re trying to catch me out,” protested Aunt Xue. “I don’t know any.”\n\n“If you don’t quote one it will be too dull,” said the Lady Dowager. “You’d better quote one. I come next, and if I can’t think of a line I’ll drink with you.”\n\nThen Aunt Xue said, “You’ll have to forgive me. I quote: ‘An old man enters the flower garden.’”\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded and said, “ ‘Taking time off to learn from the young.’ ”\n\nAfter that the dice-box passed to Li Wen. She threw and got two fours and two twos.\n\nYuang said, “This one has a name too: ‘Liu and Ruan in the Tiantai Mountains’.” Li Wen followed on with “Two Scholars Entering the Peach Blossom Land.” Next it was Li Wan’s turn and she said:\n\n“They find peach blossoms to escape from Qin.”\n\nAll took a sip of wine.\n\nThe dice-bowl now passed to the Lady Dowager, who threw two twos and two threes.\n\n“This means I have to drink,” she said.\n\n“This is called ‘A Wild-Goose in Jiangnan Leading Its Young’,” Yuanyang told her. “All of you should drink a cup.”\n\n“The young may be young, but they’ve flown quite a long way,” remarked Xifeng. The others eyed her reproachfully and she said no more.\n\n“What am I to say?” asked the old lady. “‘The Grandsire Leads His Grandson’.”\n\nThen it was Li Qi’s turn. She said:\n\n“At leisure watch the children catching willow-down.”\n\nThis was generally approved.\n\nBaoyu was itching to have his turn, but the bowl passed him by. He was thinking of this when it came round to him at last. He threw a two, two threes and an ace.\n\n“What’s this?” he asked.\n\nYuanyang laughed.\n\n“A loss! Drink a cup first, then throw again.”\n\nHe had to drain his cup and throw once more. This time he got two threes and two fours.\n\n“This is called ‘Zhang Chang Painting His Wife’s Eyebrows’,” Yuanyang announced.\n\nBaoyu knew she was teasing him, and Bacchai blushed. Xifeng, not quite understanding, urged:\n\n“Quick, Cousin Baoyu, then we’ll see who comes next.”\n\nBaoyu found it hard to explain and simply conceded, “I’ll pay a forfeit. I’ve no next player.”\n\nThe bowl passed to Li Wan, who threw the dice.\n\n“The mistress has thrown ‘The Twelve Golden Beauties’!” cried Yuanyang.\n\nBaoyu stepped over to look. It was a pretty combination of red and green.\n\n“This is very attractive,” he remarked.\n\nThen suddenly he remembered his dream of the twelve beauties of Jinling and, returning slowly to his seat, thought: “These twelve ladies are supposed to be from Jinling. How is it that of our large household so few are left?” His eyes travelled to Xiangyun and Bacchai. Both were still here, but Daiyu was gone. He could not hold back his tears and, afraid the others might see, excusing himself on the pretext of being too hot he left the table, hung up his tally and went out.\n\nXiangyun, watching him, supposed that he was put out at not throwing a good combination and leaving the game for that reason. She too was beginning to find it boring.\n\n“I shan’t say anything either,” Li Wan was saying. “Not all the players are here, so I may as well drink a cup by way of forfeit.”\n\n“This game is rather dull,” said the Lady Dowager. “Let’s drop it and get Yuanyang to throw to see what comes up.”\n\nA maid put the dice-bowl down before Yuanyang. She threw two twos and a five, while the fourth dice went on spinning in the bowl.\n\n“Not a five!” she cried.\n\nBut a five it was.\n\n“Good gracious, I’ve lost,” she exclaimed.\n\nThe Lady Dowager asked, “What’s this combination called?”\n\n“It has a name, but I can’t think of any tune to fit it.”\n\n“Tell me the name and I’ll make up a tune for you.”\n\n“It’s ‘Waves Sweeping Duckweed’.”\n\n“That’s not too hard. Let me give you ‘Autumn Fish in a Water-Chestnut Nest’.”\n\nXiangyun, who was next, followed with:\n\n“White duckweed, in the autumn river sung to death.”\n\nThe rest cried, “That’s very apt.”\n\n“That’s the end of the game,” said the Lady Dowager. “Now let’s drink a few cups and have our rice.” Looking round she asked, “Where’s Baoyu? Why hasn’t he come back?”\n\n“He went to change,” Yuanyang told her.\n\n“Who went with him?”\n\nYinger came up to reply, “I saw Master Bao going out and told Sister Xiren to go after him.”\n\nThis reassured the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. After a while, Lady Wang sent a maid to find him. The maid went to the new house and found Wu-er there lighting candles.\n\n“Where is Master Bao?” she asked.\n\n“Drinking in the old lady’s place.”\n\n“But I’ve just come from there, and Her Ladyship sent me to look for him. How could he be there?”\n\n“I’ve no idea. You’d better look somewhere else.”\n\nThe maid had to go back. Meeting Qiuwen she asked, “Have you any idea where Master Bao is?”\n\n“I’m looking for him too. Their Ladyships are waiting for him to have dinner. Where can he have gone? Go back quickly to the old lady, but don’t say he’s not there. Just say he’s been drinking and doesn’t feel too well, so he won’t have any dinner but is having a little nap and will come later. Ask the old lady and Her Ladyship to start their meal.”\n\nThe maid did as she was told and reported this to Zhenzhu, who passed it on to the Lady Dowager.\n\n“He never could eat much,” said the old lady. “It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t want anything. Let him rest. Tell him he needn’t come over, as his wife is here.”\n\nZhenzhu said to the maid, “You heard that, did you?”\n\nThe maid assented but, not liking to make this clear, simply made a round and said she had delivered the message. Nobody paid any attention, and after the meal they sat about chatting. No more of this.\n\nMeanwhile Baoyu, overcome with grief, had wandered out aimlessly. When Xiren caught up with him and asked what was the matter, he said, “Nothing. I just feel rather upset. While they’re drinking, let’s go and call on Madam You.”\n\n“But Madam You is here. Who do you want to see?”\n\n“Nobody. I’d just like to see what her place is like since she’s living here.”\n\nXiren had to accompany him, chatting as they walked. When they reached Madam You’s quarters, a small side gate there was half closed. Instead of going in, Baoyu saw two old women who were gatemen sitting on the threshold talking.\n\nHe asked them, “Is this small gate open?”\n\n“It’s usually closed,” they answered. “But today someone said that the old lady may want some fruit from the Garden, so we’ve opened it to wait.”\n\nBaoyu strolled slowly in that direction and saw that the side gate was indeed ajar. He was about to enter when Xiren stopped him.\n\n“Don’t go in,” she urged. “The Garden’s not clean. As nobody lives there now, you may see something uncanny there.”\n\nFlushed with wine he retorted, “I’m not afraid of that.”\n\nBut she held him back firmly. The old women overtook them and said, “The Garden’s quiet now. Since that Taoist priest caught the monster, we often go there alone to pick flowers or fruit. If you want to go in, sir, we’ll come with you. With so many of us, what is there to be afraid of?”\n\nBaoyu was delighted, and Xiren could not very well stop him but had to go along too.\n\nWhen he entered the Garden he found it desolate and forlorn. Plants were withering and the pavilions had lost their splendour. In the distance, however, he saw a clump of bamboos still luxuriantly green.\n\n“Since I fell ill and moved out, I’ve not been allowed in here for several months,” he reflected. “How quickly it’s become so neglected! But look at those green bamboos — isn’t that where Bamboo Lodge is?”\n\n“You haven’t been here for months, yet you’ve even forgotten the way,” said Xiren. “We were chatting and didn’t notice that we’d passed Happy Red Court.” She pointed back. “That’s Bamboo Lodge.”\n\nFollowing her finger Baoyu said,So we’ve passed it. Let’s go back.\n\n\"I'll go back and have a look.\"\n\n\"It's late,\" said Xiren. \"The old lady will be waiting for you to have supper. We must go back.\"\n\nBaoyu said nothing but walked on, retracing his steps. Now although nearly a year had passed since he left the Garden, how could he have forgotten the way? Xiren, afraid that at Bamboo Lodge the sight of Daiyu's old home would upset him, had tried to fool him into thinking they had passed it. Then, when he walked straight on, she had been afraid that he might be possessed by some evil spirit and so had told him that they had already passed it, not knowing that his one thought was to go to Bamboo Lodge. He was hurrying ahead now and Xiren had to catch up. Seeing him standing stock-still as if listening to something, she asked, \"What are you listening for?\"\n\n\"Is there someone living in Bamboo Lodge now?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"I distinctly heard weeping inside. How can there be no one?\"\n\n\"You're imagining things. You often heard Miss Lin crying here in the past, and you're still imagining it.\"\n\nNot convinced, he wanted to go on listening, but now the serving-women caught up with them.\n\n\"Do go back, Master Bao!\" they urged. \"It's late. We wouldn't mind going to other parts of the Garden, but this place is so secluded, and they say that since Miss Lin's death there's often been the sound of weeping here, so nobody dares come.\"\n\nBaoyu and Xiren were both startled by this.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" he exclaimed. Tears streamed down his cheeks. \"Cousin Lin! Cousin Lin!\" he sobbed. \"It was my fault! But it was our parents who decided things; it wasn't that I was unfaithful! Don't blame me, please!\" He broke down and wept so bitterly that Xiren, not knowing what to do, was relieved to see Qiuwen arrive with some servants.\n\n\"How dare you bring Master Bao here?\" Qiuwen scolded Xiren. \"The old lady and Lady Wang were so worried they sent people to search for you everywhere. One of the gatemen said the two of you had come here, which gave them such a fright that they scolded me and ordered me to bring servants to fetch you. Hurry up and go back!\"\n\nBaoyu was still crying heart-brokenly. Paying no attention to this, Xiren and Qiuwen took him by the arms to lead him away, wiping his tears as they told him how worried the old lady was. He had to let them take him back.\n\nKnowing that the Lady Dowager was anxious, Xiren took Baoyu back to her apartments, where the whole family was waiting for them.\n\n\"Xiren!\" scolded the old lady. \"I entrusted Baoyu to you because I thought you had good sense. How could you take him to the Garden today? His illness is only just better, and if he'd seen something there to bring on another fit, what would we have done?\" Xiren dared not defend herself but had to lower her head in silence.\n\nBaochai was dismayed by Baoyu's distraught look. But he, afraid that Xiren was being unfairly blamed, said:\n\n\"There's nothing to fear in broad daylight. It's so long since I visited the Garden, I just felt like strolling there on the spur of the moment after drinking. What could I have run into there?\"\n\nXifeng, who had had a frightening experience in the Garden, shivered and said, \"Cousin Bao is much too reckless.\"\n\nXiangyun put in, \"It's not recklessness but single-mindedness. He's probably been to call on the hibiscus spirit or to find some fairy.\"\n\nBaoyu said nothing. Only Lady Wang was too worried to speak.\n\n\"Didn't you meet anything frightening in the Garden?\" the old lady asked Baoyu. \"Well, we'll say no more about it. In future, when you go for a stroll, you must take more servants. But for you, we'd have broken up long ago. Off you go now and have a good sleep. Tomorrow, come first thing to make up for the party you've spoiled today, so that we can all have one more day's fun. Don't let him cause any more trouble.\"\n\nThe others then took their leave and went away. Aunt Xue accompanied Lady Wang to her quarters, Xiangyun stayed with the Lady Dowager, and Yingchun...\n\nBaoyu went to see Xichun. The others then dispersed and we need not follow them.\n\nBaoyu went back to his own rooms sighing despondently. Baochai, who knew the reason, ignored him for fear that brooding might bring on his old illness. She went into the inner room and summoned Xiren to ask her exactly what had happened in the Garden.\n\nBut more of this in the following chapter."
