  "original": "话说他三人因见探春等进来，忙将此话掩住不提。探春等问候过，大家说笑一回方散。\n　　谁知上回所表的那位老太妃已薨，凡诰命等皆入朝随班，按爵守制，敕谕天下，凡有爵之家，一年内不得筵宴音乐，庶民皆三月不得婚姻。贾母婆媳祖孙等俱每日入朝随祭，至未正以后方回。在大偏宫二十一日后，方请灵人先陵，地名孝慈县。这陵离都来往得十来日之功，如今请灵至此，还要停放数日，方入地宫，故得一月光景。宁府贾珍夫妻二人，也少不得是要去的。两府无人，因此大家计议，家中无主，便报了“尤氏产育”，将他腾挪出来，协理宁、荣两处事件。因托了薛姨妈在园内照管他姊妹丫鬟，只得也挪进园来。此时宝钗处有湘云、香菱；李纨处目今李婶母虽去，然有时来往，三五日不定，贾母又将宝琴送与他去照管；迎春处有岫烟；探春因家务冗杂，且不时有赵姨娘与贾环嘈聒，甚不方便；惜春处房屋狭小。因此薛姨妈都难住。况贾母又千叮咛万嘱咐托他照管黛玉，自己素性也最怜爱他，今既巧遇这事，便挪至潇湘馆和黛玉同房，一应药饵饮食，十分经心。黛玉感戴不尽，以后便亦如宝钗之称呼。连宝钗前亦直以“姐姐”呼之，宝琴前直以“妹妹”呼之：俨似同胞共出，较诸人更似亲切。贾母见如此，也十分喜悦放心。薛姨妈只不过照管他姊妹，禁约的丫鬟辈，一应家中大小事务也不肯多一。尤氏虽天天过来，也不过应名点卯；不肯乱作威福。且他家内上下，也只剩了他一人料理，再者每日还要照管贾母王夫人的下处一应所需饮撰铺设之物，所以也甚操劳。\n　　当下荣、宁两处主人既如此不暇，并两处执事人等，或有跟随着入朝的，或有朝外照理下处事务的，又有先踩踏下处的，也都各各忙乱。因此两处下人无了正经头绪，也都偷安，或乘隙结党，和暂权执事者窃弄威福。荣府只留得赖大并几个管家照管外务。这赖大手下常用几个人已去，虽另委人，都是些生的，只觉不顺手。且他们无知，或赚骗无节，或呈告无据，或举荐无因，种种不善，在在生事，也难备述。\n　　又见各官宦家凡养优伶男女者，一概蠲免遣发，尤氏等便议定，待王夫人回家回明，也欲遣发十二个女孩子，又说：“这些人原是买的，如今虽不学唱，尽可留着使唤，只令其教习们自去也罢了。”王夫人因说：“这学戏的倒比不得使唤的，他们也是好人家的女儿，因无能，卖了做这事，装丑弄鬼的几年。如今有这机会，不如给他们几两银子盘费，各自去罢。当日祖宗手里都是有这例的。咱们如今损阴坏德，而且还小器。如今虽有几个老的还在，那是他们各有原故不肯回去的，所以才留下使唤，大了配了我们家里小厮们了。”尤氏道：“如今我们也去问他十二个，有愿意回去的，就带了信儿，叫他父母来亲自领回去，给他们几两银子盘缠方妥。倘若不叫上他的亲人来，只怕有混账人冒名领出去，又转卖了，岂不辜负了这恩典？若有不愿意回去的，就留下。”王夫人笑道：“这话妥当。”尤氏等遣人告诉了凤姐儿，一面说与总理房中，每教习给银八两，令其自便。凡梨香院一应物件，查清记册收明，派人上夜。将十二个女孩子叫来，当面细问，倒有一多半不愿意回家的。也有说父母虽有，他只以卖我们姊妹为事，这一去还被他卖了；也有说父母已亡，或被伯叔兄弟所卖的；也有说无人可投的；也有说恋恩不舍的，所愿去者止四五人。王夫人听了，只得留下。将去者四五人皆令其干娘领回家去，单等他亲父母来领；将不愿去者分散在园中使唤。贾母便留下文官自使，将正旦芳官指给了宝玉，小旦蕊官送了宝钗，小生藕官指给了黛玉，大花面葵官送了湘云，小花面豆官送了宝琴，老外艾官指给了探春，尤氏便讨了老旦茄官去。当下各得其所，就如那倦鸟出笼，每日园中游戏。众人皆知他们不能针黹，不惯使用，皆不大责备。其中或一二个知事的，愁将来无应时之技，亦将本技丢开，便学起针黹纺绩女工诸务。\n　　一日正是朝中大祭，贾母等五更便去了。下处用些点心小食，然后入朝，早膳已毕，方退至下处歇息。用过午饭，略歇片刻，复入朝侍中晚二祭，方出至下处歇息；用过晚饭方回家。可巧这下处乃是一个大官的家庙，是比丘尼焚修，房舍极多极净。东西二院，荣府便赁了东院，北静王府便赁了西院。太妃少妃每日晏息，见贾母等在东院，彼此同出同入，都有照应。外面诸事不消细述。\n　　且说大观园内贾母王夫人天天不在家内，又送灵去一月方回，各丫鬟婆子皆有空闲，多在园内游玩。更又将梨香院内伏侍的众婆子一概撤回，并散在园内听使，更觉园内人多了几十个。因文官等一干人，或心性高傲，或倚势凌下，或拣衣挑食，或一角锋芒，大概不安分守己者多，因此众婆子含怨，只是口中不敢与他们分争。如今散了学，大家趁了愿，也有丢开手的，也有心地狭窄犹怀旧怨的，因将众人皆分在各房名下，不敢来厮侵。\n　　可巧这日乃是清明之日，贾琏已备下年例祭祀，带领贾环、贾琮、贾兰三人去往铁槛寺祭柩烧纸，宁府贾蓉也同族中人各办祭祀前往。因宝玉病未大愈，故不曾去得。饭后发倦，袭人因说：“天气甚好，你且出去逛逛，省的撂下粥碗就睡，存在心里。”宝玉听说，只得拄了一支杖，着鞋走出院来。因近日将园中分与众婆子料理，各司各业，皆在忙时。也有修竹的，也有树的，也有栽花的，也有种豆的，池中间又有驾娘们行着船夹泥的，种藕的。湘云、香菱、宝琴与些丫鬟等都坐在山石上瞧他们取乐。宝玉也慢慢行来。湘云见了他来，忙笑说：“快把这船打出去！他们是接林妹妹的。”众人都笑起来。宝玉红了脸，也笑道：“人家的病，谁是好意的？你也形容着取笑儿！”湘云笑道：“病也比人家另一样，原招笑儿，反说起人来。”说着，宝玉便也坐下，看着众人忙乱了一回。湘云因说：“这里有风，石头上又冷，坐坐去罢。”\n　　宝玉也正要去瞧黛玉，起身拄拐，辞了他们，从沁芳桥一带堤上走来。只见柳垂金线，桃吐丹霞，山石之后一株大杏树，花已全落，叶稠阴翠，上面巳结了豆子大小的许多小杏。宝玉因想道：“能病了几天，竟把杏花辜负了，不觉到‘绿叶成阴于满枝’了。”因此仰望杏子不舍。又想起邢岫烟已择了夫婿一事，虽说男女大事不可不行，但未免又少了一个好女儿，不过二年，便也要“绿叶成阴子满枝”了。再过几日，这杏树子落枝空；再几年，岫烟也不免乌发如银，红颜似缟。因此，不免伤心，只管对杏叹息。正想叹时，忽有一个雀儿飞来，落于枝上乱啼。宝玉又发了呆性，心下想道：“这雀儿必定是杏花正开时他曾来过，今见无花空有叶，故也乱啼。这声韵必是啼哭之声。可恨公冶长不在眼前，不能问他。但不知明年再发时，这个雀儿可还记得飞到这里来与杏花一会不能？”\n　　正自胡思间，忽见一股火花从山石那边发出，将雀儿惊飞。宝玉吃了一惊，又听外边有人喊道：“藕官你要死！怎么弄些纸钱进来烧？我回奶奶们去，仔细你的肉！”宝玉听了，益发疑惑起来，忙转过山石看时，只见藕官满面泪痕，蹲在那里，手内还拿着火，守着些纸钱灰作悲。宝玉忙问道：“你给谁烧纸？快别在这里烧！你或是为父母兄弟，你告诉我姓儿，外头去叫小厮们打了包袱写上名姓去烧。”\n　　藕官见了宝玉，只不做一声，宝玉数问不答。忽见一个婆子恶狠狠的走来拉藕官，口内说道：“我已经回了奶奶们，奶奶们气的了不得！”藕官听了，终是孩气，怕去受辱没脸，便不肯去。婆子道：“我说你们别太兴头过馀了。如今还比得你们在外头乱闹呢！这是尺寸地方儿。”指着宝玉道：“连我们的爷还守规矩呢，你是什么阿物儿，跑了这里来胡闹！—怕也不中用，跟我快走罢！”宝玉忙道：“他并没烧纸，原是林姑娘叫他烧那烂字纸，你没看真，反错告了他。”藕官正没了主意，见了宝玉，更自添了畏惧；忽听他反替遮掩，心内转忧成喜，也便硬着口说道：“很看真是纸钱子么？我烧的是林姑娘写坏的字纸。”那婆子便弯腰向纸灰中拣出不曾化尽的遗纸在手内，说道：“你还嘴硬？有证又有凭，只和你厅上讲去。”说着，拉了袖子，拽了要走。宝玉忙拉藕官，又用拄杖隔开那婆子的手，说道：“你只管拿了回去。实告诉你，我这夜做了个梦，梦见杏花神和我要一挂白钱，不可叫本房人烧，另叫生人替烧，我的病就好的快了。所以我请了白钱，巴巴的烦他来替我烧了，我今日才能起来。偏你又看见了！这会子又不好了，都是你冲了，还要告他去？藕官，你只管见他们去，就依着这话说！”藕官听了，越得主意，反拉着要走。那婆子忙丢下纸钱，陪笑央告宝玉说道：“我原不知道，若回太太，我这人岂不完了？”宝玉道：“你也不许再回，我便不说。”婆子道：“我已经回了，原叫我带他。只好说他被林姑娘叫去了。”宝玉点头应允，婆子自去。\n　　这里宝玉细问藕官：“为谁烧纸？必非父母兄弟，定有私自的情理。”藕官因方才护庇之情，心中感激，知他是自己一流人物，况再难隐瞒，便含泪说道：“我这事、除了你屋里的芳官合宝姑娘的蕊官，并没第三个人知道。今日忽然被你撞见，这意思少不得也告诉了你，只不许再对一人言讲。”又哭道：“我也不便和你面说，你只回去，背人悄悄问芳官就知道了。”说毕怏怏而去。\n　　宝玉听了心下纳闷，只得踱到潇湘馆。瞧黛玉越发瘦得可怜，问起来，比往日大好了些。黛玉见他也比先大瘦了，想起往日之事，不免流下泪来。些微谈了一谈，便催宝玉去歇息调养。宝玉只得回来。因惦记着要问芳官原委，偏有湘云、香菱来了，正和袭人、芳官一处说笑，不好叫他，恐人又盘诘，只得耐着。\n　　一时芳官又跟了他干娘去洗头，他干娘偏又先叫他亲女儿洗过才叫芳官洗。芳官见了这样，便说他偏心：“把你女儿的剩水给我洗？我一个月的月钱都是你拿着，沾我的光不算，反倒给我剩东西的。”他干娘羞恼变成怒，便骂他：“不识抬举的东西！怪不得人人都说戏子没一个好缠的，凭你什么好的，入了这一行，都学坏了！这一点子小崽子也挑么挑六，咸嘴淡舌，咬群的骡子似的。”娘儿两个吵起来。袭人忙打发人去说：“少乱唤，瞅着老太太不在家，一个个连句安静话也都不说了！”睛雯因说：“这是芳官不省事，不知狂的什么，也不过是会两出戏，倒象杀了贼王、擒过反叛来的。”袭人道：“‘一个巴掌拍不响’，老的也太不公些，小的也太可恶些。”宝玉道：“怨不得芳官。自古说：‘物不平则鸣。’他失亲少眷的在这里，投人照看，赚了他的钱，又作践他，如何怪得！”又向袭人说：“他到底一月多少钱？以后不如你收过来照管他，岂不省事些。”袭人道：“我要照看他，那里不照看了，又要他那几个钱才照看他，没的招人家骂去。”说着，便起身到那屋里，取了一瓶花露油、鸡蛋、香皂、头绳之类，叫了一个婆子来：“送给芳官去，叫他另要水自己洗罢，别吵了。”\n　　他干娘越发羞愧，便说芳官：“没良心，只说我克扣你的钱！”便向他身上拍了几下，芳官越发哭了。宝玉便走出来，袭人忙劝：“做什么？我去说他。”睛雯忙先过来，指他干娘说道：“你这么大年纪，太不懂事！你不给他好好的洗，我们才给他东西，你自己不臊，还有脸打他！他要是还在学里学艺，你也敢打他不成？”那婆子便说：“‘一日叫娘，终身是母。’他排揎我，我就打得。”袭人唤麝月道：“我不会和人拌嘴，晴雯性太急，你快过去震吓他两句。”麝月听了，忙过来说道：“你且别嚷，我问问你，别说我们这一处，你看满园子里谁在主子屋里教导过女儿的？就是你的亲女儿，既经分了房有了主子，自有主子打骂，再者大些的姑娘姐姐们也可以打得骂得。谁许你老子娘又半中间管起闲事来了？都这样管，又要叫他们跟着我们学什么？越老越没了规矩！你见前日坠儿的妈来吵，你如今也跟着他学。你们放心，因连日这个病那个病，再老太太又不得闲，所以我也没有去回。等两日咱们去痛回一回，大家把这威风煞一煞儿才好呢！况且宝玉才好了些，连我们也不敢说话，你反打的人狼号鬼哭的。上头出了几日门，你们就无法无天的，眼珠子里就没了人了，再两天，你们就该打我们了！他也不要你这干娘，怕粪草埋了他不成？”\n　　宝玉恨的拿拄杖打着门槛子说道：“这些老婆子都是铁心石肠似的，真是大奇事！不能照看，反倒挫磨他们。地久天长，如何是好？”晴雯道：“什么‘如何是好’！都撵出去，不要这些中看不中吃的就完了！”那婆子羞愧难当，一言不发。只见芳官穿着海棠红的小绵袄，底下绿绸洒花夹裤，敞着裤腿，一头乌油油的头发披在脑后，哭的泪人一般。麝月笑道：“把个莺莺小姐弄成才拷打的红娘了。这会子又不妆扮了，还是这么着？”晴雯因走过去拉着，替他洗净了发，用手巾拧的干松松的，挽了一个慵妆髻，命他穿了衣裳，过这边来。\n　　接着内厨房的婆子来问：“晚饭有了，可送不送？”小丫头听了，进来问袭人。袭人笑道：“方才胡吵了一阵，也没留心听听几下钟了？”晴雯道：“这劳什子又不知怎么了，又得去收拾。”说着，拿过表来瞧了一瞧，说道：“再略等半钟茶的工夫就是了。”小丫头去了。麝月笑道：“提起淘气来，芳官也该打两下儿，昨日是他摆弄了那坠子半日，就坏了。”说话之间，便将食具打点现成。一时小丫头子捧了盒子进来站住，晴雯、麝月揭开看时，还是这四样小茶。晴雯笑道：“已经好了，还不给两样清淡菜吃，这稀饭咸菜闹到多早晚？”一面摆好．一面又看那盒中，却有一碗火腿鲜笋汤，忙端了放在宝玉跟前。宝玉便就桌上喝了一口，说道：“好汤！”众人都笑道：“菩萨！能几日没见荤腥儿，就馋的这个样儿。”一面说，一面端起来，轻轻用口吹着。因见芳官在侧，便递给芳官道：“你也学些伏侍，别一味傻玩傻睡。嘴儿轻着轻，别吹上唾沫星儿。”芳官依言果吹了几口，甚妥。他干娘也端饭在门外伺候，向里忙跑进来，笑道：“他不老成，看打了碗，等我吹罢。”一面说，一面就接。晴雯忙喊道：“快出去，你等他砸了碗，也轮不到你吹！你什么空儿跑到里儿来了？”一面又骂小丫头们：“瞎了眼的，他不知道，你们也该说给他。”小丫头们都说：“我们撵他不出去，说他又不信，如今带累我们受气。这是何苦呢！你可信了？我们到的地方儿，有你到的一半儿，那一半儿是你到不去的呢。何况又跑到我们到不去的地方儿，还不算，又去伸手动嘴的了！”一面说，一面推他出去。阶下几个等空盒家伙的婆子见他出来，都笑道：“嫂子也没有拿镜子照一照，就进去了。”羞的那婆子又恨又气，只得忍耐下去了。\n　　芳官吹了几口，宝玉笑道：“你尝尝，好了没有？”芳官当是玩话，只是笑着看袭人等。袭人道：“你就尝一口何妨。”晴雯笑道：“你瞧我尝。”说着便喝一口。芳官见如此，他便尝了一口，说：“好了。”递给宝玉，喝了半碗，吃了几片笋，又吃了半碗粥，就算了。众人便收出去。小丫头捧沐盆，漱盥毕，袭人等去吃饭。宝玉使个眼色给芳官，芳官本来伶俐，又学了几年戏，何事不知？便装肚子疼，不吃饭了。袭人道：“既不吃，在屋里做伴儿。把粥留下，你饿了再吃。”说着去了。\n　　宝玉将方才见藕官，如何谎言护庇，如何“藕官叫我问你”，细细的告诉一遍。又问：“他祭的到底是谁？”芳官听了，眼圈儿一红，又叹一口气，道：“这事说来，藕官儿也是胡闹。”宝玉忙问：“如何？”芳官道：“他祭的就是死了的药官儿。”宝玉道：“他们两个也算朋友，也是应当的。”芳官道：“那里又是什么朋友哩？那都是傻想头。他是小生，药官是小旦，往常时他们扮作两口儿，每日唱戏的时候都装着那么亲热，一来二去，两个人就装糊涂了，倒象真的一样儿。后来两个竟是你疼我，我爱你。药官儿一死，他就哭的死去活来的，到如今不忘，所以每节烧纸。后来补了蕊官，我们见他也是那样，就问他：‘为什么得了新的就把旧的忘了？’他说：‘不是忘了。比如人家男人死了女人，也有再娶的，只是不把死的丢过不提就是有情分了。’你说他是傻不是呢？”宝玉听了这呆话，独合了他的呆性，不觉又喜又悲，又称奇道绝，拉着芳官嘱咐道：“既如此说，我方一句话嘱咐你，须得你告诉他，以后断不可烧纸，逢时节，只备一炉香，一心虔诚就能感应了。我那案上也只设着一个炉，我有心事，不论日期，时常焚香，随便新水新茶就供一盏，或有鲜花鲜果，甚至荤腥素菜都可。只在敬心，不在虚名。以后快叫他不可再烧纸了。”芳官听了，便答应着。一时吃过粥，有人回说：“老太太回来了。”\n要知端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "Just as the three of them were talking, Tan-chun and the other girls arrived and they hastily dropped the subject. After inquiring how Hsi-feng was, they chatted for a while before leaving.\n\nNow the old Imperial Consort mentioned earlier had passed away. All ladies with titles had to attend the mourning ceremonies at court in order of rank, and an imperial decree forbade all families of nobility for a year from giving feasts or having music performed, while commoners were forbidden to marry for three months. The Lady Dowager and her daughters-in-law and granddaughters had to attend the sacrifices at court each day, not returning until after two o’clock. Not until the twenty-first day of the sacrifice in a side-palace was the coffin conveyed to the Imperial Sepulchre previous to its interment. This was in the county of Hsiaotzu, and as the journey there and back took over ten days and the coffin had to remain in the sepulchre for some time before being lowered into the vault, they were away for a whole month. Since Chia Chen of the Ning Mansion and his wife had to go too and both mansions were left empty, it was decided to pretend that Madam Yu was about to have a baby so that she could stay behind to manage the affairs of both mansions. And Aunt Hsueh was asked to move into the Garden to look after the young ladies and maids.\n\nSo now Pao-chai had Hsiang-yun and Hsiang-ling with her. Although Aunt Li had left, she came back every few days to see Li Wan, and the Lady Dowager had asked Pao-chin to stay with her too. Ying-chun had Hsiu-yen, but Tan-chun was too busy with household affairs to have a companion; and as Concubine Chao and Chia Huan were always making trouble, she had no peace. His-chun’s rooms were too small. So Aunt Hsueh found it hard to settle anywhere. Besides, the Lady Dowager had urged her repeatedly to take good care of Tai-yu, for whom she had always had a special fondness; and so it worked out very well that she could move into Bamboo Lodge to share Tai-yu’s apartment, taking great care to see that she had all the medicine and nourishment she needed. Tai-yu was deeply grateful and from then on addressed Aunt Hsueh as “mother” and Pao-chai and Pao-chin as “elder” and “younger sister” respectively, as if they were her own sisters, showing them even more affection than before. The Lady Dowager was pleased and relieved to see this.\n\nAunt Hsueh simply looked after the young ladies and kept the maids in order, not meddling in any other business. Although Madam Yu came over every day, she only went through the motions, not presuming to make decisions. And as she had to manage the Ning Mansion single-handed as well as see to the requirements of the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang during their absence, she was kept very busy.\n\nWith the mistresses of both mansions so fully occupied, and the stewards either attending their masters to court or preparing for their return or out selecting sites for their temporary resting-places, all was bustle and confusion. The servants left behind, having no one to control them, amused themselves as they pleased, and some of them seized this chance to form cliques and abuse their authority. In the Jung Mansion, Lai Ta and a few stewards had been left in charge of outside business. But since Lai Ta’s usual assistants had gone and the replacements were new to their jobs, he found them very inefficient. Being ignorant and inexperienced, they either cheated or exceeded their authority, bringing forward unfounded charges or making recommendations for no good reason. The trouble they caused is beyond description.\n\nLearning that all official families had dismissed their actors and actresses, Madam Yu and the others decided that on Lady Wang’s return they would propose sending away their twelve young actresses.\n\n“These girls were bought,” they said. “Now that they’ve stopped performing, we can keep them here as maids and just dismiss their instructors.”\n\nBut Lady Wang said, “These actresses are different from ordinary maids. They’re from good families and were sold to learn this profession because they were too poor to stay at home; and for years they’ve had to play villains and clowns. Now that we’ve this opportunity, we should give them a few taels for their travelling expenses and send them home. Our ancestors did the same. To keep them here would be not only unkind but mean. Although some of the older instructors are still here, they have their own homes too.\n\nSome of the girls had been unwilling to go home and were kept on to run errands, to be married later to pages in the household.\n\n“Now we should ask all twelve of them,” proposed Madam You. “If any want to go home, let their parents come to fetch them and we’ll give them a few taels for their travelling expenses. That would be the best way. If we don’t send for their parents, some scoundrels may turn up to claim them and sell them again — that would be a poor return for the Emperor’s goodness. Those who don’t want to leave should stay on.”\n\nLady Wang agreed and Madam You sent to inform Xifeng of this, as well as the stewards in the office. The instructors were paid eight taels each and allowed to go wherever they pleased. All the things in Pear Fragrance Court were checked and entered in the register, and some servants were assigned to keep watch there at night. The twelve young actresses were summoned and questioned. It turned out that more than half of them did not want to go home. Some said that though their parents were still alive they had only sold them; if they went back they would be sold again. Others said that their parents were dead and they had been sold by uncles or cousins. Others had no relatives to turn to. Still others were unwilling to leave because they were grateful to the Jias. Only four or five wanted to go. Lady Wang had to keep those who were willing to stay. The four or five who wanted to leave were made to wait until their own parents came to fetch them; their foster-mothers were not allowed to take them. Those who stayed were assigned to different apartments in the Garden.\n\nThe Lady Dowager kept Wenguan to wait on her herself. She gave the young dan Fangguan to Baoyu, the young actress Ruiguan to Baochai, the young male lead Ouguan to Daiyu, the painted-face Kuiguan to Xiangyun, the young painted-face Douguan to Baoqin, and the older actress Aiguan to Tanchun. Madam You took the older dan Qieguan for herself. And so each of them had her own quarters. Like birds released from a cage they amused themselves in the Garden every day. Everybody knew that they had never learned to sew or wait on people, so they were not strict with them. One or two of the more sensible ones, worried at having no practical skills for the future, did give up acting and start learning sewing, spinning and other feminine tasks.\n\nOne day there was a major sacrifice at court, and the Lady Dowager and the rest had to be there at the fifth watch. They had some refreshments in their temporary quarters before entering the palace. Not till after the morning sacrifice did they withdraw to rest, and after lunch they went back for two more sacrifices in the afternoon and evening before returning to their quarters for a meal and then going home. These temporary lodgings were in the family temple of a high official, a convent where Buddhist nuns practised devotion. It had many spotless rooms. The Rong Mansion had rented the east court and the Prince of Beijing’s household the west court. The prince’s mother and wife, resting there daily, saw the Lady Dowager and the rest in the east court and they looked after each other, going in and out together. But no more of this.\n\nAfter the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang had left the Garden, and Xifeng was away for a month seeing off Lady Wang’s coffin, the maids and serving-women with time on their hands mostly amused themselves in the Garden. And now all the women who had been serving in Pear Fragrance Court were withdrawn and assigned to different parts of the Garden, so that several dozen more people were added to the staff there. However, as Wenguan and the other actresses were a supercilious, troublesome lot, inclined to bully those beneath them and fussy about their food and clothing, most of them were not easy to get on with. The serving-women, though they dared not answer back, bore them a grudge. Now that the actresses had left the court, the women had their wish. Some let bygones be bygones, but the more narrow-minded nursed their resentment. However, as the actresses had been assigned to different apartments, they dared not offend them.\n\nIt so happened that this was the day of the Pure Brightness Festival. Jia Lian, who had prepared the customary sacrifices, took Jia Huan, Jia Cong and Jia Lan to Iron Threshold Temple to offer sacrifices and burn paper money. Jia Rong of the Ning Mansion went with some other clansmen to offer sacrifices at their family cemetery. Baoyu did not go because he was not yet fully recovered. After breakfast he felt tired.\n\n“It’s a lovely day,” Xiren said. “You should go out for a stroll instead of sleeping as soon as you’ve put down your bowl. That’s bad for you.”\n\nSo he had to take a stick and hobble out in his slippers. The garden had recently been divided up for the old serving-women to look after, and each was busy with her own task. Some were pruning bamboos, others trimming trees, some planting flowers or sowing seed, while on the lake boatwomen were gathering mud with nets to plant lotus roots. Xiangyun, Xiangling, Baoqin and some maids were sitting on the rocks, watching them and enjoying themselves. Baoyu walked slowly over to join them.\n\nXiangyun laughed when she saw him. \"Drive that boat away quick!\" she cried. \"They've come to fetch Cousin Lin.\"\n\nThe rest burst out laughing.\n\nBaoyu flushed and retorted, \"It's not my fault I've been ill. You're making fun of me deliberately.\"\n\n\"Illness is different in your case. It's comical. Don't accuse me of making fun of you.\"\n\nHe sat down then to watch the bustle, till Xiangyun said, \"There's a wind here and the rock is cold. Do go and sit inside.\"\n\nAs Baoyu had been meaning to call on Daiyu, he rose and leaning on his stick took leave of them. He made his way along the bank by Seeping Fragrance Bridge. The willows' golden tendrils and peach-blossom's crimson clouds were past their prime, and behind a rock a large apricot tree was a mass of green foliage, its fallen blossoms replaced by countless tiny green apricots no bigger than beans.\n\n\"To think that just a few days' illness made me miss the apricot-blossom!\" he mused. \"Now 'green leaves make a shade and the boughs are filled with fruit.'\" He stood gazing up at the tree, reluctant to leave. Then he remembered that Xiuyan was engaged to be married. Although this was an important event in a girl's life, it meant one good daughter less. In a couple of years she too would be \"laden with fruit.\" And soon the apricots on this tree would be gone, the boughs left bare. In a few more years Xiuyan would no longer be young and beautiful. The thought distressed him, and he was sighing over the apricots when a bird alighted on a branch and started chirping away. This touched off another train of fancies.\n\n\"That bird must have come here when the tree was in blossom,\" he reflected. \"Now that there are no blossoms, only leaves, it's chirping in dismay. Its chirping is lamentation. It's a pity Gongye Chang isn't here to tell us what it's saying. I wonder if, next year when the tree blooms again, this bird will remember to come back and keep its tryst with the blossom.\"\n\nHis reverie was cut short by a flame which darted up from the other side of the rock, frightening the bird away. Startled, he heard a voice cry:\n\n\"Want to die, Ouguan? How dare you burn paper money here? I'll tell the mistresses and see they have the skin off your back!\"\n\nMore puzzled than ever, Baoyu hurried round the rock to see Ouguan, her face wet with tears, crouching on the ground beside some ashes of paper money, a light still in her hand.\n\n\"Who are you sacrificing to?\" he asked. \"You mustn't do it here. If it's for your parents or brothers, tell me their names and I'll have pages outside burn a parcel of paper money for you with their names on it.\"\n\nAt sight of Baoyu, Ouguan made no answer. And before he could repeat his question an old serving-woman bustled up furiously to grab her.\n\n\"I've reported you to the mistresses,\" she fumed. \"They're absolutely furious!\"\n\nOuguan, being childish, was afraid of a disgraceful scene and refused to go with her.\n\n\"I told you not to get above yourselves,\" scolded the woman. \"This isn't like the wild goings-on you used to carry on outside. This is a respectable place.\" She pointed at Baoyu. \"Even our young masters keep the rules here. Who do you think you are, you little whore, coming here to carry on in this scandalous way? It's no use being afraid now. You come along with me!\"\n\n\"She wasn't burning paper money,\" put in Baoyu quickly. \"Miss Lin told her to burn some old writings. You didn't look carefully and made a false accusation.\"\n\nOuguan, at a loss before,\n\nHaving made up her mind to do this, at sight of Baoyu she felt more afraid than ever. But then, to her surprise, he covered up for her. Her fear turned to joy and she asserted boldly:\n\n“Are you sure it was spirit money? I was burning some spoiled calligraphy of Miss Lin’s.”\n\nThe woman stooped to pick out from the ashes a fragment of paper which had not been completely burnt.\n\n“Still talking big, are you?” she cried. “Here’s evidence. Come along to the hall with me.” She took Ouguan by the sleeve and started dragging her off.\n\nBaoyu quickly caught hold of Ouguan and fended off the woman with his cane.\n\n“Take that paper back with you and I’ll tell you the truth,” he said. “I dreamed last night that the Apricot Goddess asked me for some white spirit money — it had to be burnt by a stranger, not by any of my own people. If this was done, she said, my illness would be cured sooner. So I got this spirit money and asked her, as a favour, to burn it for me. That’s why I’m up and about today. It’s too bad you had to see her. Now you’ve spoilt everything. How can you report her? Go ahead, Ouguan, you can tell them this story.”\n\nOuguan, even more encouraged, now made as if to drag the woman with her. The latter promptly dropped the paper and pleaded with Baoyu ingratiatingly.\n\n“I didn’t know that,” she said. “If I report this to Her Ladyship, I’ll be for it.”\n\n“If you don’t report it, neither will I,” he promised.\n\n“I’ve already reported that I’d bring her back. I’ll have to say that Miss Lin sent for her.”\n\nWhen Baoyu nodded agreement, the woman went off.\n\nThen he questioned Ouguan in detail. “Who was that money for? It can’t have been for your parents or brothers, there must be some secret reason.”\n\nHis protection had filled Ouguan with gratitude. She knew that he was one of them, and in any case it was no use trying to hide the truth. With tears in her eyes she said:\n\n“Apart from Fangguan in your place and Ruiguan in Miss Baochai’s, no one else knows about this. Since you’ve found me out today, I suppose I’ll have to tell you; but you mustn’t let anyone else know.” She sobbed, “I can’t tell you to your face. Go back and ask Fangguan quietly when no one’s about.”\n\nShe then went despondently away.\n\nBaoyu, very puzzled, walked on to Bamboo Lodge. He found Daiyu thinner than ever and, on inquiring, was told that she was slightly better. She for her part thought him much thinner too, and the memory of the past reduced her to tears. After a brief conversation she urged him to go back and rest, to build up his health. So he had to leave.\n\nAnxious as he was to ask Fangguan for an explanation, he found Xiangyun and Xiangling there chatting and laughing with Xiren and Fangguan. He could not very well call her aside for fear of arousing suspicion, and had to bide his time.\n\nPresently Fangguan went off with her foster-mother to wash her hair. But the woman made her own daughter wash first, then told Fangguan to use the same water.\n\n“Am I to use your daughter’s left-over water?” Fangguan protested. “You take all my monthly allowance, and instead of treating me well you give me your leavings.”\n\nThe woman, shamed into anger, swore, “You ungrateful thing! No wonder everyone says actresses are a troublesome lot. It doesn’t matter how good you are to start with, this job makes you bitchy. Why, you young bitch, you’re not content with your lot, but must find fault and stir up trouble — you’re a regular kicker in the herd.”\n\nAs the two of them started squabbling, Xiren sent someone over to say, “Stop that yelling! The old lady’s not at home, but must you make such a row?”\n\nQingwen put in, “Fangguan’s so childish and crazy — all because she can sing a couple of operas, you’d think she’d carried out some great raid or captured a rebel chief.”\n\n“It takes two to make a quarrel,” said Xiren. “The old woman’s too unfair, and the girl is too tiresome.”\n\n“Don’t blame Fangguan,” said Baoyu. “As the old saying goes, ‘Injustice will cry out.’ She’s an orphan here with no one to turn to but us, and instead of looking after her they fleece her and bully her. How can you blame her for complaining?” He turned to Xiren. “How much is her monthly allowance? Wouldn’t it be simpler if from now on you took it and looked after her?”\n\n“If I look after her, of course I shall. But why should I take her allowance? I don’t want to be cursed for that.”\n\nWith that she stood up and fetched from the next room a bottle of perfumed hair-oil, some eggs, scented soap and strings for tying up hair.\n\n“Take these to Fangguan,” she told an old woman, “and tell her to ask for some water and wash her hair herself. She’s not to make any more fuss.”\n\nThis made the foster-mother more ashamed than ever.\n\n“Ungrateful wretch!” she scolded Fangguan. “Accusing me of swindling you!” She gave her a couple of slaps which made the girl cry even more bitterly.\n\nBaoyu started out then, but Xiren hastily stopped him.\n\n“What are you going to do? Let me speak to her.”\n\nQingwen had already darted forward to point at the foster-mother.\n\n“A woman of your age should know better!” she cried. “It’s because you wouldn’t give her a proper wash that we’re having to give her these things. Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? How dare you hit her? If she were still training in the opera school, would you dare do that?”\n\n“You call me your mother as long as you live,” retorted the woman. “If she answers me back, I’ve a right to beat her.”\n\nXiren called Sheyue and said, “I’m no good at arguing, and Qingwen’s too hot-tempered. You go and give her a good talking-to.”\n\nSheyue went over at once.\n\n“Stop that shouting,” she ordered. “Let me ask you something. Not to speak of just our compound, have you ever seen anyone in the whole Garden whose foster-mother dares come into a young master’s or young mistress’ rooms to discipline her daughter? Even if she were your own daughter, once she’s assigned to a master and has her own quarters, it’s for her master to beat or scold her. Or if she’s a bit older, the senior maids can beat or scold her too. What business is it of her parents? Who told you to interfere? If everyone carried on the way you do, what would be the point of the girls learning their duties from us? The older you are, the less you seem to know the rules. The other day you saw Zhuier’s mother making a scene, and now you’re copying her. Don’t worry, because so many people have been ill these last few days and the old lady’s been too busy, I haven’t reported this yet. In a couple of days I shall make a full report and we must see to it that this high-handed behaviour is checked. Besides, Baoyu’s only just getting better. Even we don’t dare raise our voices, yet you’ve reduced her to howls and shrieks. The mistress has been away from home for a few days, and that’s made you so unruly you’ve no eyes for anyone. In another couple of days, I suppose, you’ll be beating us. She doesn’t want you for a foster-mother. Are you afraid she’ll be buried alive if she has no one?”\n\nBaoyu in his anger was beating the threshold with his cane.\n\n“These old women are all hard-hearted,” he fumed. “It’s simply fantastic! Instead of looking after the girls, they’re always bullying them. What’s to be done?”\n\n“Done?” snapped Qingwen. “Drive the whole lot out and be done with it. Clear them all out, these useless old creatures!”\n\nThe foster-mother, overcome by shame, said not a word.\n\nThen Fangguan was seen there in her red silk padded jacket and green flowered silk trousers with loose trouser-legs, her glossy black hair hanging down her back. She was crying as if her heart would break.\n\nSheyue said laughingly, “She’s like the young mistress Yingying being thrashed instead of the maid Hongniang. Aren’t you going to do your hair up, but leave it like that?”\n\nQingwen went over to pull Fangguan to her feet and helped her to wash her hair. Then she wrung it dry for her with a towel, twisted it up into a loose knot, and told her to put on her clothes and come to the other room.\n\nJust then a servant from the inner kitchen came to ask, “The dinner’s ready. Shall we send it over?”\n\nA young maid came in to ask Xiren.\n\n“Just now we were making such a row, I didn’t hear what time it is,” Xiren answered with a smile.\n\n\"The clock stopped?\" exclaimed Qingwen. \"What can have gone wrong with the wretched thing now? It will have to be fixed again.\"\n\nShe took the clock and looked at it.\n\n\"Just wait the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, that's all,\" she said.\n\nThe young maid withdrew.\n\n\"Sheyue laughed.\n\n\"Speaking of naughtiness, Fangguan deserves a spanking too. She was playing with the clock yesterday for the longest time, and that must be how it got broken.\"\n\nWhile speaking she had laid out the eating utensils, and now a young maid brought in a hamper and stood waiting while Qingwen and Sheyue uncovered it. It contained the same four kinds of delicacies as before.\n\n\"Better though he is, why not give him a couple of light dishes to eat?\" protested Qingwen. \"How long are we going to go on with gruel and pickles?\"\n\nAs she set them out she noticed a bowl of fresh bamboo-shoot and ham soup, which she promptly put before Baoyu. He took a sip from the bowl there on the table.\n\n\"Good soup!\" he said.\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\"Buddha be praised! How many days has it been since you tasted meat that you're so greedy for it?\"\n\nThey handed him the bowl, and he blew gently on it. Seeing Fangguan standing beside him he passed it to her.\n\n\"You must learn to wait on people too,\" he told her, \"not just fool around all the time. Blow on it gently, mind. Don't dribble into it.\"\n\nShe did as he said, blowing on it several times. It was all right. But then her foster-mother, who was waiting outside the door with the rice, hurried in.\n\n\"She's not to be trusted,\" she said. \"She may drop the bowl. Let me blow on it for you.\"\n\nAs she reached out for the bowl Qingwen cried, \"Just you get out! Even if he smashes the bowl, it's none of your business. How dare you come in here? What place is this for you?\"\n\nShe rounded on the younger maids. \"Are you blind? If she doesn't know any better, you should have told her.\"\n\n\"We did try to drive her out and told her not to come in,\" they said, \"but she wouldn't listen and now we're the ones to be scolded. We're not having that! Do you believe us now? We can go to half the places you can't, not to say the places that are out of bounds even to us. Yet not content with barging in, you have to start meddling.\"\n\nAs they spoke they pushed her out. Some old women waiting below the steps for the hamper teased, \"Why didn't you look in the mirror before going in?\"\n\nThe nurse, mortified and furious, had to put up with this.\n\nAfter Fangguan had blown on the soup, Baoyu said with a smile, \"Taste it and see if it's cool enough.\"\n\nThinking this a joke she simply smiled and glanced at Xiren.\n\n\"What harm if you do take a sip?\" asked Xiren.\n\n\"Watch me,\" said Qingwen, and took a sip herself.\n\nThen Fangguan followed suit and said, \"It's all right.\" She handed the bowl to Baoyu, who drank half the soup and ate a few bamboo-shoots before finishing half his bowl of gruel. That was all he wanted.\n\nThe others cleared the things away, a young maid brought in a basin for him to rinse his mouth, and then Xiren and the rest went for their meal. Baoyu winked at Fangguan, and she being intelligent as well as versed in the ways of the world after her years in acting immediately feigned a stomach-ache and said she did not want any meal.\n\n\"In that case, keep him company here,\" said Xiren. \"We'll leave the gruel for you in case you feel hungry later.\" Then she left.\n\nBaoyu now described how he had met Ouguan, her fib to cover up and her message \"Ouguan wants me to ask you.\"\n\n\"Who is it she was sacrificing to?\" he asked.\n\nAt this Fangguan's eyes reddened and she sighed.\n\n\"In this business, Ouguan's been very silly,\" she said.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"She was sacrificing to her dead friend Jiaoguan.\"\n\n\"As they were friends, that was only right.\"\n\n\"What sort of friends were they? It was just a childish fancy. They were both\n\nAfter that, Aiguan played young male roles and Yaoguan young female ones, and every day in operas they acted the parts of lovers so convincingly that they came to feel genuinely enamoured of each other. They were so devoted to each other that when Yaoguan died Aiguan wept as if she would never be consoled; and to this day she still mourns her, burning offerings at every festival. Then Rui-guan took Yaoguan’s place, and when we saw that Aiguan treated her just as well we asked her: “Why have you forgotten your old love so soon?”\n\n“It’s not that I’ve forgotten her,” she said. “But when a man’s wife dies he often marries again, and as long as he doesn’t stop caring for the dead one that shows he has some feeling. Don’t you agree?”\n\nBaoyu, amused and touched by this foolish talk which so matched his own folly, exclaimed in wonder and approval. Taking Fang-guan’s hand he advised her:\n\n“Since that’s the way she feels, I’ve a message for her: you must tell her from now on not to burn paper offerings. At festivals she should just burn incense. Sincerity is what counts. On my desk I keep an incense-burner, and whenever the mood takes me I burn some incense and offer a bowl of fresh water or tea, some fresh flowers or fruit, or even meat or vegetables. It’s the thought that counts, not empty show. So tell her quickly not to burn paper money any more.”\n\nFang-guan promised to do so.\n\nSoon they had finished their congee and someone came to announce, “The old lady’s back.”\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
