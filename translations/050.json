  "original": "话说薛宝钗道：“到底分个次序，让我写出来。”说着，便令众人拈阄为序。起首恰是李氏，然后按次各各开出。凤姐儿道：“既这么说，我也说一句在上头。”众人都笑起来了，说：“这么更妙了。”宝钗将“稻香老农”之上补了一个“凤”字，李纨又将题目讲给他听。凤姐儿想了半天，笑道：“你们别笑话我，我只有了一句粗话，可是五个字的。下剩的我就不知道了。”众人都笑道：“越是粗话越好。你说了，就只管干正事去罢。”凤姐儿笑道：“想下雪必刮北风，昨夜听见一夜的北风，我有一句，这一句就是‘一夜北风紧’。使得使不得，我就不管了。”众人听说，都相视笑道：“这句虽粗，不见底下的，这正是会作诗的起法。不但好，而且留了写不尽的多少地步与后人。就是这句为首，稻香老农快写上，续下去。”凤姐儿和李婶娘、平儿又吃了两杯酒，自去了。这里李纨就写了：\n　　一夜北风紧，\n　　自己联道：\n　　开门雪尚飘。入泥怜洁白，\n　　香菱道：\n　　匝地惜琼瑶。有意荣枯草，\n　　探春道：\n　　无心饰萎苗。价高村酿熟，\n　　李绮道：\n　　年稔府粱饶。葭动灰飞管，\n　　李纹道：\n　　阳回斗转杓。寒山已失翠，\n　　岫烟道：\n　　冻浦不生潮。易挂疏枝柳，\n　　湘云道：\n　　难堆破叶蕉。麝煤融宝鼎，\n　　宝琴道：\n　　绮袖笼金貂。光夺窗前镜，\n　　黛玉道：\n　　香料壁上椒。舒风仍故故，\n　　宝玉道：\n　　清梦转聊聊。何处梅花笛？\n　　宝钗道：\n　　谁家碧玉箫？鳌愁坤轴陷，\n　　李纨笑道：“我替你们看热酒去罢。”宝钗命宝琴续联；只见湘云起来道：\n　　龙斗阵云销。野岸回孤棹，\n　　宝琴也笑道\n　　吟鞭指灞桥。赐裘怜抚戌，\n　　湘云那里肯让人？且别人也不如他敏捷，都看他扬眉挺身说道：\n　　加絮念征徭。坳垤审夷险，\n　　宝钗连声赞好，也便联道：\n　　枝柯怕动摇。皑皑轻趁步，\n　　黛玉忙联道：\n　　剪剪舞随腰。苦茗成新赏，\n　　一面说，一面推宝玉命他联。宝玉正看宝琴、宝钗、黛玉三人共战湘云，十分有趣，那里还顾得联诗？今见黛玉推他，方联道：\n　　孤松订久要。泥鸿从印迹，\n　　宝琴接着联道：\n　　林斧或闻樵。伏象千峰凸，\n　　湘云忙联道：\n　　盘蛇一径遥。花缘经冷结，\n　　宝钗和众人又都赞好，探春联道：\n　　色岂畏霜凋。深院惊寒雀，\n　　湘云正渴了，忙忙的吃茶，已被岫烟抢着联道：\n　　空山泣老。阶墀随上下，\n　　湘云忙丢了茶杯联道：\n　　池水任浮漂。照耀临清晓，\n　　黛玉忙联道：\n　　缤纷入永宵。诚忘三尺冷，\n　　湘云忙笑联道：\n　　瑞释九重焦。僵卧谁相问，\n　　宝琴也忙笑联道：\n　　狂游客喜招。天机断缟带，\n　　湘云又忙道：\n　　海市失鲛绡。\n　　黛玉不容他道出，接着便道：\n　　寂寞封台榭，\n　　湘云忙联道：\n　　清贫怀箪瓢。\n　　宝琴也不容情，也忙道：\n　　烹茶水渐沸，\n　　湘云见这般，自为得趣，又是笑，又忙联道：\n　　煮酒叶难烧。\n　　黛玉也笑道：\n　　没帚山僧扫，\n　　宝琴也笑道：\n　　埋琴稚子挑。\n　　湘云笑弯了腰，忙念了一句，众人问道：“到底说的是什么！”湘云道：\n　　石楼闲睡鹤，\n　　黛玉笑得握着胸口，高声嚷道：\n　　锦暖亲猫。\n　　宝琴也忙笑道：\n　　月窟翻银浪，\n　　湘云忙联道：\n　　霞城隐赤标。\n　　黛玉忙笑道：\n　　沁梅香可嚼，\n　　宝钗笑称：“好句！”也忙联道：\n　　淋竹醉堪调。\n　　宝琴也忙道：\n　　或湿鸳鸯带，\n　　湘云忙联道：\n　　时凝翡翠翘。\n　　黛玉又忙道：\n　　无风仍脉脉，\n　　宝琴又忙笑联道：\n　　不雨亦潇潇。\n　　湘云伏着，已笑软了。众人看他三人对抢，也都不顾作诗，看着也只是笑。黛玉还推他往下联，又道：“你也有才尽力穷之时！我听听，还有什么舌头嚼了？”湘云只伏在宝钗怀里笑个不住。宝钗推他起来，道：“你有本事，把‘二萧’的韵全用完了，我才服你。”湘云起身笑道：“我也不是作诗，竟是抢命呢！”众人笑道：“倒是你自己说罢。”探春早已料定没有自己联的了，便早写出来，因说：“还没收住呢。”李纹听了，接过来，便联了一句道：\n　　欲志今朝乐，\n　　李绮收了一句道：\n　　凭诗祝舜尧。\n　　李纨道：“够了够了。虽没全完了韵，腾挪的字，若生扭了，倒不好了。”说着大家来细细评论一回，独湘云的多，都笑道：“这都是那块鹿肉的功劳。”李纨笑道：“逐句评去，却还一气，只是宝玉又落了第了。”宝玉笑道：“我原不会联句，只好担待我罢。”李纨笑道：“也没有社社担待的：又说‘韵险’了，又整误了，又‘不会联句’，今日必罚你。我才看见栊翠庵的红梅有趣，我要折一技插在瓶。可厌妙玉为人，我不理他，如今罚你取一技来插着玩儿。”众人都道：“这罚的又雅又有趣。”宝玉也乐为，答应着就要走。湘云、黛玉一起说着：“外头冷得很，你且吃杯热酒再去。”于是湘云早热起壶酒来了，黛玉递了个大杯，满斟了一杯。湘云笑道：“你吃了我们这酒，要取不来，加倍罚你！”宝玉忙吃了一杯，冒雪而去。\n　　李纨命人好好跟着，黛玉忙拦说：“不必，有了反不得了。”李纨点头道是，一面命丫鬟将一个美女耸肩瓶拿来，贮了水准备插梅。因又笑道：“回来该吟红梅了。”湘云忙道：“我先作一首。”宝钗笑道：“今日断不容你再作了，你都抢了去，别人都闲着也没趣。回来罚宝玉。他说不会联句，如今就叫他自己做去。”黛玉笑道：“这话很是。我还有主意，方才联句不够，莫若拣那联得少的人作红梅诗。”宝钗笑道：“这话极是。方才邢、李三位屈才，且又是客，琴儿和颦儿云儿抢了他们许多。我们一概都别作，只他们三人做才是。”李纨因说：“绮儿也不大会做，还是让琴妹妹罢。”宝钗只得依允。又道：“就用‘红梅花’三个字做韵，每人一首七言律。邢大妹妹做‘红’字，你们李大妹妹做‘梅’字，琴儿做‘花’字。”李纨道：“饶过宝玉去，我不服。”湘云忙道：“有个好题目命他做。”众人问：“何题？”湘云道：“命他就做‘访妙玉乞红梅’，岂不有趣？”众人听了，都说：“有趣！”一语未了，只见宝玉笑欣欣擎了一枝红梅进来。众丫鬟忙已接过，插入瓶内。众人都道：“来赏玩！”宝玉笑道：“你们如今赏罢，也不知费了我多少精神呢。”说着，探春早又递了一钟暖酒来，众丫鬟上来接了蓑笠掸雪。各人屋里丫鬟都添送衣裳来，袭人也遣人送了半旧的狐腋褂来。李纨命人将那蒸的大芋头盛了一盘，又将朱桔、黄橙、橄榄等物盛了两盘，命人带给袭人去。湘云且告诉宝玉方才的诗题，又催宝玉快做。宝玉道：“好姐姐好妹妹们，让我自己用韵罢，别限韵了。”众人都说：“随你做去罢。”一面说，一面大家看梅花。原来这一枝梅花只有二尺来高，旁有一枝纵横而出，约有二三尺长，其间小枝分歧，或如蟠螭，或如僵蚓，或孤削如笔，或密聚如林，真乃花吐胭脂，香欺兰蕙。各各称赏。\n　　谁知岫烟、李纹、宝琴三人都已吟成，各自写了出来。众人便依“红”“梅”“花”三字之序看去，写道：\n　　赋得红梅花\n　　邢岫烟\n　　桃未芳菲杏未红，冲寒先喜笑东风。\n　　魂飞庚岭春难辨，霞隔罗浮梦未通。\n　　绿萼添妆融宝炬，缟仙扶醉跨残虹。\n　　看来岂是寻常色，浓淡由他冰雪中。\n　　又\n　　李纹\n　　白梅懒赋赋红梅，逞艳先迎醉眼开。\n　　冻脸有痕皆是血，醉心无恨亦成灰。\n　　误吞丹药移真骨，偷下瑶池脱旧胎。\n　　江北江南春灿烂，寄言蜂蝶漫疑猜。\n　　又\n　　宝琴\n　　疏是枝条艳是花，春妆儿女竞奢华。\n　　闲庭曲槛无馀雪，流水空山有落霞。\n　　幽梦冷随红袖笛，游仙香泛绛河槎。\n　　前身定是瑶台种，无复相疑色相差。\n　　众人看了，都笑着称赞了一回，又指末一首更好。宝玉见宝琴年纪最小，才又敏捷；黛玉、湘云二个斟了一小杯酒，都贺宝琴。宝钗笑道：“三首各有好处。你们两个天天捉弄厌了我，如今又捉弄他来了。”\n　　李纨又问宝玉：“你可有了？”宝玉忙道：“我倒有了，才一看见这三首，又唬忘了。等我再想。”湘云听了，便拿了一支铜火箸击着手炉，笑道：“我击了，若鼓绝不成，又要罚的。”宝玉笑道：“我已有了。”黛玉提起笔来，笑道：“你念我写。”湘云便击了一下，笑道：“一鼓绝。”宝玉笑道：“有了，你写罢。”众人听他念道：\n　　酒未开樽句未裁，\n　　黛玉写了，摇头笑道：“起的平平。”湘云又道：“快着。”宝玉笑道：\n　　寻春问腊到蓬莱。\n　　黛玉、湘云都点头笑道：“有些意思了。”宝玉又道：\n　　不求大士瓶中露，为乞孀娥槛外梅。\n　　黛玉写了，摇头说：“小巧而已。”湘云将手又敲了一下。宝玉笑道：\n　　入世冷挑红雪去，离尘香割紫云来。\n　　槎谁惜诗肩瘦，衣上犹沾佛院苔。\n　　黛玉写毕，湘云大家才评论时，只见几个丫鬟跑进来道：“老太太来了。”众人忙迎出来，大家又笑道：“怎么这等高兴！”说着，远远见贾母围了大斗篷，带着灰鼠暖兜，坐着小竹轿，打着青绸油伞，鸳鸯、琥珀等五六个丫鬟，每人都是打着伞，拥轿而来。李纨等忙往上迎。贾母命人止住，说：“只站在那里就是了。”来至跟前，贾母笑道：“我瞒着你太太和凤丫头来了。大雪地下，我坐着这个无妨，没的叫他娘儿们踩雪吗。”众人忙上前来接斗篷，搀扶着，一面答应着。\n　　贾母来至室中，先笑道：“好俊梅花！你们也会乐，我也不饶你们！”说着，李纨早命人拿了一个大狼皮褥子来，铺在当中。贾母坐了，因笑道：“你们只管照旧玩笑吃喝。我因为天短了，不敢睡中觉，抹了一会牌，想起你们来了，我也来凑个趣儿。”李纨早又捧过手炉来。探春另拿了一副杯箸来，亲自斟了暖酒奉给贾母。贾母便饮了一口，问：“那个盘子是什么东西？”众人忙捧了过来回说：“是糟鹌鹑。”贾母道：“这倒罢了，撕一点子腿儿来。”李纨忙答应了，要水洗手，亲自来撕。贾母道：“你们仍旧坐下说笑，我听着才喜欢。”又命李纨：“你也只管坐下，就如同我没来的一样才好，不然我就走了。”众人听了，方才依次坐下，只李纨挪到尽下边。贾母因问：“你们作什么玩呢？”众人便说：“做诗呢。”贾母道：“有做诗的，不知做些灯谜儿，大家正月里好玩。”众人答应。说笑了一会，贾母便说：“这里潮湿，你们别久坐，仔细着了凉。倒是你四妹妹那里暖和，我们到那里瞧瞧他的画儿，赶年可能有了不能。”众人笑道：“那里能年下就有了？只怕明年端阳才有呢。”贾母道：“这还了得，他竟比盖这园子还费工夫了。”\n　　说着，仍坐了竹椅轿，大家围随，过了藕香榭，穿入一条夹道，东西两边皆是过街门，门楼上里外都嵌着石头匾。如今进的是西门，向外的匾上凿着“穿云”二字，向里的凿着“度月”两字。来至堂中，进了向南的正门，贾母下了轿，惜春已接出来了。从里面游廊过去，便是惜春卧房，厦檐下挂着“暖香坞”的匾，早有几个人打起猩红毡帘，已觉暖气拂脸。大家进入屋里，贾母并不归坐，只问惜春：“画到那里了？”借春因笑回：“天气寒冷了，胶性都凝涩不润，画了恐不好看，故此收起来了。”贾母笑道：“我年下就要的，你别脱懒儿，快拿出来给我快画。”一语未了，忽见凤姐披着紫羯绒褂笑嘻嘻的来了，口内说道：“老祖宗今儿也不告诉人，私自就来了，叫我好找！”贾母见他来了，心中喜欢，道：“我怕你冻着，所以不许人告诉你去。你真是个小鬼灵精儿，到底找了我来。论礼，孝敬也不在这上头。”凤姐儿笑道：“我那里是孝敬的心找了来呢？我因为到了老祖宗那里，鸦没雀静的，问小丫头子们，他又不肯叫我找到园里来。我正疑惑，忽然又来了两个姑子，我心里才明白了，那姑子必是来送年疏或要年例香例银子，老祖宗年下的事也多，一定是躲债来了。我赶忙问了那姑子，果然不错。我才就把年例给了他们去了。这会子老祖宗的债主儿已去了，不用躲着了。已预备下稀嫩的野鸡，请用晚饭去罢，再迟一回就老了。”\n　　他一行说，众人一行笑。凤姐儿也不等贾母说话，便命人抬过轿来。贾母笑着挽了凤姐儿的手，仍上了轿，带着众人，说笑出了夹道东门。一看四面，粉妆银砌，忽见宝琴披着凫靥裘，站在山坡背后遥等，身后一个丫鬟，抱着一瓶红梅。众人都笑道：“怪道少了两个，他却在这里等着，也弄梅花去了！”贾母喜的忙笑道：“你们瞧，这雪坡儿上，配上他这个人物儿，又是这件衣裳，后头又是这梅花，象个什么？”众人都笑道：“就象老太太屋里挂的仇十洲画的《艳雪图》。”贾母摇头笑道：“那画的那里有这件衣裳？人也不能这样好。”一语未了，只见宝琴身后又转出一个穿大红猩猩毡的人来。贾母道：“那又是那个女孩儿？”众人笑道：“我们都在这里，那是宝玉。”贾母笑道：“我的眼越发花了。”说话之间，来至跟前，可不是宝玉和宝琴两个？宝玉笑向宝钗、黛玉等道：“我才又到了栊翠庵，妙玉竟每人送你们一枝梅花，我已经打发人送去了。”众人都笑说：“多谢你费心。”\n　　说话之间，已出了园门，来至贾母房中。吃毕饭大家又说笑了一回，忽见薛姨妈也来了，说：“好大雪，一日也没过来望候老太太。今日老太太倒不高兴？正该赏雪才是。”贾母笑道：“何曾不高兴了！我找了他们姐妹去玩了一会子。”薛姨妈笑道：“昨儿晚上我原想着今日要和我们姨太太借一天园子，摆两桌粗酒，请老太太赏雪的；又见老太太安歇的早，我听见宝儿说：‘老太太心里不大爽。’因此如今也不敢惊动。早知如此，我竟该请了才是呢。”贾母笑道：“这才是十月，是头场雪，往后下雪的日子多着呢，再破费姨太太不迟。”薛姨妈笑道：“果然如此，算我的孝心虔了。”凤姐儿笑道：“姨妈怎么忘了，如今现秤五十两银子来，交给我收着，一下雪我就预备下酒。姨妈也不用操心，也不得忘了。”贾母笑道：“既这么说，姨太太给他五十两银子收着，我和他每人分二十五两，到下雪的日子，我装心里不爽，混过去了。姨太太更不用操心，我和凤姐倒得实惠呢。”凤姐将手一拍，笑道：“妙极！这和我的主意一样。”众人都笑了。贾母笑道：“呸！没脸的，就顺着竿子爬上来了！你不说：姨太太是客，在咱们家受屈，我们该请姨太太才是，那里有破费姨太太的理？不这么说呢，还有脸先要五十两银子，真不害臊。”凤姐笑道：“我们老祖宗最是有眼色的，试一试姨妈，要松呢，拿出五十两来，就和我分；这会子估量着不中用了，翻过来拿我做法子，说出这些大方话来。如今我也不和姨妈要银子了，我竟替姨妈出银子，治了酒，请老太太吃了，我另外再封五十两银子孝敬老祖宗，算是罚我个包揽闲事，这可好不好？”话未说完，众人都笑倒在炕上。\n　　贾母因又说及宝琴雪下折梅，比画儿上还好，又细问他的年庚八字并家内景况。薛姨妈度其意思，大约是要给他求配。薛姨妈心中因也遂意，只是已许过梅家了，因贾母尚未说明，自己也不好拟定，遂半吐半露告诉贾母道：“可惜了这孩子没福，前年他父亲就没了。他从小儿见的世面倒多，跟他父亲四山五岳都走遍了。他父亲好乐的，各处因有买卖，带了家眷这一省逛一年，明年又到那一省逛半年，所以天下十停走了有五六停了。那年在这里，把他许了梅翰林的儿子，偏第二年他父亲就辞世了。如今他母亲又是痰症。”凤姐儿也不等说完，使声跺脚的说：“偏不巧，我正要做个媒呢，又已经许了人家！”贾母笑道：“你要给谁说媒？”凤姐儿笑道：“老祖宗别管。心里看准了，他们两个是一对。如今有了人家，说也无益，不如不说罢了。”贾母也知凤姐儿的意思，听见已有人家，也就不提了。大家又闲话了一会方散。一宿无话。次日雪晴。饭后，贾母又吩咐惜春：“不管冷暖，你要画去；赶到年下，十分不能，就罢了。第一要紧把昨儿琴儿和丫头、梅花，照样一笔别错快快添上。”惜春听了，虽是为难的事，就应了。一时众人都来看他如何画。惜春只是出神。李纨因笑向众人道：“让他自己想去，咱们且说话儿。昨儿老太太只叫做灯谜儿，回到家和绮儿纹儿睡不着，我就编了两个《四书》的。他两个每人也编了两个。”众人听了，都笑道：“这倒该做的。先说了，我们猜猜。”李纨笑道：“‘观音未有世家传’，打《四书》一句。”湘云接着就说道：“‘在止于至善’。”宝钗笑道：“你也想一想‘世家传’三个字的意思再猜。”李纨笑逼：“再想。”黛玉笑道：“我猜罢。可是‘虽善无征’？”众人都笑道：“这句是了。”李纨又道：“‘一池青草草何名’。”湘云又忙道：“这一定是‘蒲芦也’，再不是不成？”李纨笑道：“这难为你猜。纹儿的是‘水向石边流出冷’，打一古人名。”探春笑着问道：“可是山涛？”李纨道：“是。”李纨又道：“绮儿是个‘萤’字，打一个字。”众人猜了半日，宝琴道：“这个意思却深，不知可是花草的‘花’字？”李绮笑道：“恰是了。”众人道：“萤与花何干？”黛玉笑道：“妙的很，萤可不是草化的？”众人会意，都笑了，说：“好。”\n　　宝钗道：“这些虽好，不合老太太的意。不如做些浅近的物儿，大家雅俗共赏才好。”众人都道：“也要做些浅近的俗物才是。”湘云想了一想，笑道：“我编了一支《点绛唇》，却真是个俗物，你们猜猜。”说着，便念道：\n　　溪壑分离，红尘游戏，真何趣？名利犹虚，后事终难继。\n　　众人都不解，想了半日，也有猜是和尚的，也有猜是道士的，也有猜是偶戏人的。宝玉笑了半日道：“都不是。我猜着了，必定是耍的猴儿。”湘云笑道：“正是这个了。”众人道：“前头都好，末后一句怎么样解？”湘云道：“那一个耍的猴儿不是剁了尾巴去的？”众人听了都笑起来，说：“偏他编个谜儿也是刁钻古怪的。”\n　　李纨道：“昨日姨妈说，琴妹妹见得世面多，走的道路也多，你正该编谜儿。况且你的诗又好，为什么不编几个儿我们猜一猜？”宝琴听了，点头含笑，自去寻思。宝钗也有一个，念道：\n　　镂檀镌梓一层层，岂系良工堆砌成？\n　　虽是半天风雨过，何曾闻得梵铃声？\n　　众人猜时，宝玉也有一个，念道：\n　　天上人间两渺茫，琅节过谨提防。\n　　鸾音鹤信须凝睇，好把唏嘘答上苍。\n　　黛玉也有了一个，念道：\n　　何劳缚紫绳？驰城逐堑势狰狞。\n　　主人指示风云动，鳌背三山独立名。\n探春也有了一个，方欲念时，宝琴走来，笑道：“从小儿所走的地方的古迹不少，我也来挑了十个地方古迹，做了十首‘怀古诗’。诗虽粗鄙，却怀往事，又暗隐俗物十件，姐姐们请猜一猜。”众人听了，都说：“这倒巧，何不写出来大家一看？”\n要知端的，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "“I’ll assign an order then and write it down,” proposed Pao-chai.\n\nShe made them draw lots. The order turned out to be as follows: Li Wan first, then the others in sequence.\n\n“In that case, I’ll make a start too,” volunteered Hsi-feng.\n\nThe rest laughed.\n\n“That’s even better,” they cried.\n\nPao-chai put down “Feng” above “The Old Farmer of Sweet Paddy,” and Li Wan explained the theme to Hsi-feng.\n\nAfter some thought Hsi-feng said with a smile, “You mustn’t laugh at me. I’ve only one coarse line — five words. I can’t manage any more.”\n\n“The coarser the better,” they replied. “Let’s hear it, then you can go and attend to your own affairs.”\n\n“I suppose it must blow from the north to snow,” said Hsi-feng. “Last night I heard the north wind all night long. I’ve got a line:\n\nThe north wind blows all night long.\n\nI don’t know whether it will do or not. I can’t be responsible for it anyway.”\n\nThe others looked at each other and smiled.\n\n“It may be coarse but it doesn’t show what’s coming,” they said. “That’s the way to start a poem — not just good but leaving plenty of scope for those who come after. So let this be the first line. Quick, Old Paddy Farm, write it down and continue.”\n\nHsi-feng, Aunt Li and Ping-erh drank two more cups of wine then left. Then Li Wan wrote:\n\nThe north wind blows all night long;\n\nand continued:\n\nThe door opens and snow still drifts down.\n\nTo be trodden in mud, how pity the pure white!\n\n“To cover the ground with jade,” put in Hsiang-ling.\n\nTo deck withered plants is the flakes’ delight.\n\n“They’ve no wish to adorn blighted flowers,” said Tan-chun.\n\nNo wish to adorn blighted flowers.\n\nThe price of wine has risen, the village brew is ripe;\n\n“The harvest’s good, the granaries are heaped,” added Li Wen.\n\nThe harvest’s good, the granaries are heaped.\n\nReed-ash from pipes flies off to mark the start of spring.\n\n“The handle of the Dipper turns to herald the return of spring,” said Li Chi.\n\nThe handle of the Dipper turns to herald the return of spring.\n\nCold hills have lost their vivid green,\n\n“Frozen streams no longer flow,” said Hsiu-yen.\n\nFrozen streams no longer flow.\n\nEasily it hangs from sparse willow boughs,\n\n“But hard to pile on tattered plantain leaves,” said Hsiang-yun.\n\nBut hard to pile on tattered plantain leaves.\n\nMusk-ink is melted in the precious tripod;\n\n“Bright sable’s worn with the embroidered gown,” put in Pao-chin.\n\nBright sable’s worn with the embroidered gown.\n\nThe snow outshines the mirror by the window;\n\n“Its scent is that of pepper on the wall,” said Tai-yu.\n\nIts scent is that of pepper on the wall.\n\nThe wind blows as of old through the court;\n\n“But a clear dream is broken and far-fetched,” said Pao-yu.\n\nBut a clear dream is broken and far-fetched.\n\nWhere is the flute with plum-blossom melody?\n\n“Who’ll play the jade flute?” asked Pao-chai.\n\nWho’ll play the jade flute?\n\nThe whale fears the earth’s axis may sink;\n\n“I’ll go and heat some wine for you,” suggested Li Wan with a smile.\n\nPao-chai told Pao-chin to continue, but now Hsiang-yun stood up to declaim:\n\nThe dragon’s fight makes clouds disperse.\n\nOn the wild shore lone boats return.\n\nPao-chin continued with a smile:\n\nThe poet’s whip points to Pa Bridge.\n\nBestowing furs, he pities the garrison troops;\n\nHsiang-yun, not to be outdone and more quick-witted than the rest, raised her eyebrows and straightened up to declaim:\n\nAdding to padding, he misses the conscripts.\n\nIn hollows and mounds he sees risks and hazards;\n\nPao-chai chimed in approvingly:\n\nOn boughs and branches the snow is loath to settle.\n\nWhiteness everywhere, he treads so light;\n\nTai-yu hastily took this up:\n\nHis dainty dance, girdle gems tinkling.\n\nBitter tea is a fresh pleasure;\n\nAs she said this she nudged Pao-yu to prompt him. But he was too fascinated by the contest between Pao-chin, Pao-chai and Tai-yu on the one side and Hsiang-yun on the other to remember to chip in himself. Prompted now by Tai-yu, he came out with:\n\nThe lone pine is an old friend.\n\nWild geese leave prints in the slush;\n\nPao-chin took this up:\n\nWoodsmen’s axes may be heard.\n\nProstrate elephants, a thousand peaks;\n\nHsiang-yun quickly continued:\n\nCoiled dragons, one range winding.\n\nFlowers form when it is cold;\n\nPao-chai and the rest exclaimed in admiration, and Tan-chun went on:\n\nTheir hue fears not winter’s blast.\n\nIn the deep courtyard startled sparrows;\n\nHsiang-yun, who was thirsty, took this chance to drink some tea, while Hsiu-yen took the chance to interpose:\n\nOn the bare hill an old owl cries.\n\nThe snow swirls up and down the steps;\n\nAt once Hsiang-yun put down her cup to continue:\n\nOver the pool it floats at will.\n\nIt shines more brightly at dawn;\n\nDai-yu capped this without a moment’s pause:\n\n“And all night long their flurries fly.\nThe loyal guards freeze in the cold.”\n\nXiang-yun laughingly continued:\n\n“The Emperor’s worries are laid to rest.\nWho cares for the freezing soldier?”\n\nBao-qin laughingly put in:\n\n“Travellers are glad of a friendly call.\nThe heavenly loom spins ribbons of silk.”\n\nXiang-yun cried:\n\n“The mermaid’s lost her gossamer sash.”\n\nBut Dai-yu cut in:\n\n“Towers and pavilions are sealed in jade.”\n\nXiang-yun capped:\n\n“The poor still have their gourd and bowl.”\n\nBao-qin too showed no mercy:\n\n“Water for tea is beginning to bubble.”\n\nAmused by this contest, Xiang-yun giggled as she added:\n\n“Leaves for warming wine won’t catch alight.”\n\nDai-yu said with a smile:\n\n“The monk sweeps up with a snow-broom.”\n\nBao-qin chimed in laughingly:\n\n“The boy buries his lute in snow.”\n\nXiang-yun, doubled up with mirth, rattled off another line; and when the others asked what it was she said:\n\n“The stork sleeps in its snowy nest.”\n\nDai-yu, clutching her chest and laughing, cried:\n\n“The cat’s warmed by the screen, embroidered with flowers.”\n\nBao-qin added laughingly:\n\n“The moon on the snow is a silver sea.”\n\nXiang-yun capped:\n\n“The sunlit peak a crimson banner.”\n\nDai-yu continued:\n\n“Snow on wet plum-blossom can be chewed.”\n\n“Good line!” cried Bao-chai, and capped:\n\n“The bamboos look drunk, bent down with snow.”\n\nBao-qin put in:\n\n“It drenches the love-birds’ girdle.”\n\nXiang-yun added:\n\n“And freezes the kingfisher pendants.”\n\nDai-yu went on:\n\n“Windless, the snow drifts down.”\n\nBao-qin capped:\n\n“Rainless, it falls with a whisper.”\n\nXiang-yun, collapsed over the table, was convulsed with laughter. The others had long since given up versifying and were simply watching the three of them vying with each other, laughing as they watched. Dai-yu urged Xiang-yun to go on.\n\n“So you’ve run out of steam, have you?” she teased. “I’d like to hear what more you can say.”\n\nBut Xiang-yun simply lay in Bao-chai’s arms laughing helplessly.\n\n“If you have the energy to use up all the rhymes in this category, then I’ll admit defeat,” said Bao-chai, pushing her up.\n\nXiang-yun rose to her feet.\n\n“This isn’t versifying, it’s a fight for life!” she cried.\n\n“You brought it on yourself,” the others retorted.\n\nTan-chun, seeing that the game was up as far as she was concerned, had already written out all the lines. Now she remarked:\n\n“We haven’t ended it yet.”\n\nLi Wen took the paper from her and added:\n\n“We wish to record this day’s fun.”\n\nThen Li Qi ended it with:\n\n“And celebrate it with this poem.”\n\n“That’s enough,” said Li Wan. “If we haven’t used up all the rhymes, never mind. If we force it, it won’t be good.” She read the whole poem through carefully, and they saw that Xiang-yun had the most lines.\n\n“That venison has done the trick!” they joked.\n\n“Judging line by line, it holds together quite well,” said Li Wan. “But once again Bao-yu has failed.”\n\n“I’m no good at this,” he said. “You’ll have to let me off.”\n\n“We can’t let you off every time,” she replied. “Today we must punish you. I’ve just noticed how pretty the red plum in Green Lattice Nunnery is. I want a branch to put in a vase; but I can’t be bothered with that nun Miao-yu. So as a punishment I order you to pick a branch for us.”\n\n“This is a refined punishment,” cried the rest. “Very fitting.”\n\nBao-yu agreed cheerfully and was starting out when Xiang-yun and Dai-yu said together, “It’s very cold outside. Have some hot wine before you go.” Xiang-yun promptly warmed a cup of wine and Dai-yu handed him a large goblet which she filled to the brim.\n\n“If you drink our wine, you must bring back the plum,” Xiang-yun warned him laughingly. “If you don’t, we’ll give you double punishment.”\n\nBaoyu hastily drank a cup of wine and set off through the snow.\n\nLi Wan ordered some maids to go with him, but Daiyu stopped them. “They’d only be in the way,” she said.\n\nLi Wan nodded and told a maid to fetch the swan-necked vase and fill it with water ready for the plum blossom.\n\n“When he comes back we must compose poems on red plum blossom,” she announced.\n\nXiangyun cried, “I’ll write one first!”\n\n“No, we can’t have you reeling off all the poems today,” said Baochai. “That wouldn’t be fair to the others. We should punish Baoyu. As he wouldn’t join in the couplet-making, we’ll make him write a poem on his own.”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” agreed Daiyu. “I’ve another idea too. Instead of those who did well in the couplet-making, we should make those who didn’t do so well write poems on red plum blossom.”\n\n“That’s even better.” Baochai approved. “Just now Aunt Xing’s daughter and Aunt Li’s two daughters were rather left out, and being our guests it wasn’t right for Qin, Yun and Pin to grab all the limelight. None of the rest of us will write, only these three young ladies.”\n\n“As Wen doesn’t write much poetry either,” put in Li Wan, “better let little Qin take her place.”\n\nBaochai had to agree to this.\n\n“We’ll take the three words ‘red plum blossom’ as rhymes,” she proposed. “Each of them can write a heptasyllabic regulated verse. Cousin岫烟 can take ‘red,’ Cousin纹 ‘plum’ and Qin ‘blossom’.”\n\n“I’m not going to let Baoyu off,” objected Li Wan.\n\nXiangyun cried, “I’ve a good subject for him!”\n\n“What?” they asked.\n\n“Let him write on ‘Calling on Miaoyu for Red Plum Blossom.’ Wouldn’t that be fun?”\n\nThey were all amused by this idea.\n\nJust then Baoyu came back beaming, holding a spray of red plum. The maids took it from him and put it in the vase.\n\n“Now we can enjoy it,” everyone said.\n\n“You can enjoy it now,” he told them. “But you’ve no idea how much effort it cost me.”\n\nAs Tanchun handed him a cup of warm wine, maids came forward to take his hat and cape and brush off the snow. Other maids from different apartments brought their mistresses extra clothing, and Xiren sent Baoyu a half-worn squirrel-lined jacket. Li Wan ordered a plate of steamed taros to be sent to Xiren, as well as two plates of fruit — red kumquats, loquats and olives.\n\nXiangyun then told Baoyu the subject they had chosen for his poem and urged him to start at once.\n\n“Dear sisters, do let me choose my own rhymes,” he begged. “Don’t set them for me.”\n\n“Just as you like,” they replied.\n\nMeanwhile they were admiring the plum blossom. The branch was over two feet in height with one side branch growing sideways some two or three feet long, covered with smaller branches which coiled like dragons or wriggled like worms, some stark and straight as brush-work, others dense as a grove, their blossom crimson as cinnabar and their fragrance sweeter than orchids. The whole party was loud in its praise.\n\nNow Xiuyan, Li Wen and Baoqin had already composed their poems and written them out. The others read the three poems in the order of “red,” “plum” and “flower.”\n\nON “RED” PLUM BLOSSOM by Xing Xiuyan\n\nNot yet peach-pink nor apricot-bright,\n\nIt blooms in the cold, smiling in the soft breeze;\n\nIts spirit haunts the Ridge of Meals, confusing spring,\n\nIts rosy clouds cut off from the dream of Mount Luo;\n\nGreen calyxes are touched with red, as by a flaming torch,\n\nWhile the white fairy, drunk, bestrides a rainbow;\n\nNo common beauty is this, we discern —\n\nFrom the snow it stands out, distinct and clear.\n\nON “PLUM” BLOSSOM by Li Wen\n\nWhite plum I scorn to praise, red plum I love;\n\nIts glowing beauty dazzles the tipsy eye.\n\nThough stained with tears from the cold, not blood its hue,\n\nIts heart, albeit broken, is not ashes yet;\n\nIt seems changed by an elixir wrongly swallowed,\n\nOr down from the Jasper Pool to assume this new form;\n\nAll over the north and south the spring is bright;\n\nTell bees and butterflies not to doubt its fragrance!\n\nON “FLOWER” by Baoqin\n\nSparse its branches, rich its bloom,\n\nLike girls in spring vying in finery;\n\nBy courtyard balustrade no snow is left,\n\nOnly the\n\nAmid bare mountains lingers sunset cloud.\n\nIn dark dreams a red sleeve plays the flute cold;\n\nOn the Starry River a sweet fragrance floats from a fairy’s raft.\n\nYour forebear must have grown in Jasper Tower,\n\nSo don’t protest that your beauty is different.\n\nThe others praised this with smiles and declared that the last poem was the best. Baoyu, observing that Baoqin was the youngest yet had such quick wits, was delighted too. Daiyu and Xiangyun poured a cup of wine to congratulate her.\n\n“All three poems are good,” said Baochai. “You two are always picking on me, and now you’re picking on her.”\n\nLi Wan asked Baoyu, “Have you finished yours or not?”\n\n“I had one, but the sight of these three scared it clean out of my head. Let me think again.”\n\nXiangyun at that took the bronze poker and struck the hand-stove with it.\n\n“I’m going to beat the drum,” she warned. “If you’re not ready by the time I stop, you’ll have to pay a forfeit.”\n\n“I have it,” cried Baoyu.\n\nDaiyu picked up a brush. “Recite it, I’ll write,” she said.\n\nXiangyun struck the stove once. “After the first beat,” she announced.\n\nBaoyu began:\n\nEre wine is poured verse must be wrought....\n\nDaiyu wrote this down, shaking her head. “A very tame beginning,” she teased.\n\n“Hurry up!” cried Xiangyun.\n\nBaoyu continued:\n\nTo seek for spring and snow I to fairy realms have come.\n\nDaiyu and Xiangyun nodded. “Not bad,” they said.\n\nHe went on:\n\nI ask not for the Bodhisattva’s nectar divine,\n\nBut for the breeze outside the maid in the moon’s grove.\n\n“Just ingenious,” said Daiyu as she wrote this down.\n\nXiangyun struck the stove again.\n\nBaoyu declaimed:\n\nFrom the world I come through red snow to take cold;\n\nAbove the earth I cut off purple clouds, fragrant they come.\n\nIn this floating raft pity the poet’s thin shoulders,\n\nHis clothes are still stained by the moss on Buddha’s stele.\n\nDaiyu having written this out, before Xiangyun and the others could comment, some maids ran in to announce, “The old lady’s here.”\n\nThey all hurried out to meet her.\n\n“What a pleasant surprise!” they cried.\n\nThey saw the Lady Dowager, well wrapped up in a big cloak with a hood lined with squirrel, seated in a small bamboo sedan-chair under a blue silk umbrella. Yuanyang, Hupo and five or six other maids, carrying umbrellas, were escorting the chair. Li Wan and the girls hurried forward to meet them.\n\nThe Lady Dowager made them desist, calling, “Just stay where you are.”\n\nWhen she reached them she said, “I’ve given your mothers and Xifeng the slip. It’s all right for me to come out in the snow in this chair, but I couldn’t let them tramp through the snow.”\n\nThe others took her cloak and helped her indoors, chiming in dutifully.\n\n“What lovely plum-blossom!” exclaimed the old lady as she entered. “So you’re enjoying yourselves. Well, I mean to have some fun too.”\n\nLi Wan had ordered a large wolf-skin rug to be spread in the middle of the room for the Lady Dowager. Having seated herself on it she said, “Go on with your fun and your drinking. I’ve just had a nap, and because the days are so short now I didn’t dare sleep too long; so after a game of cards I thought of you and came to join in your fun.” Li Wan handed her a hand-stove, and Tanchun brought over clean chopsticks and a cup, then poured some warm wine and offered it to her.\n\nThe old lady took a sip.\n\n“What’s that in the dish?” she asked.\n\nThey brought it for her to see. “Pickled quail,” they said.\n\n“That should be good. Just tear off a bit of the leg for me.”\n\nLi Wan promptly assented and, having washed her hands, tore off some of the meat herself.\n\n“Just sit down as you were and go on chatting,” the old lady said. “I like listening to that.” She told Li Wan, “Sit down too, just as if I weren’t here. If you don’t, I shall leave.”\n\nThey did as she said then, Li Wan moving to the lowest place.\n\n“What were you doing?” the old lady asked.\n\n“We were writing poems,” they told her.\n\n“Well, instead of writing poems why don’t you make up some lantern riddles for the New Year?” suggested the Lady Dowager. “That will be fun for the first month.”\n\nThe others assented and chatted for a while, until the old lady said, “It’s damp here, you mustn’t sit too long or you may catch cold. It’s warmer in your fourth sister’s place. Let’s go and see how her painting’s coming on, and whether it will be ready by New Year.”\n\n“How could it be ready by then?” they cried. “It won’t be finished till the Dragon-Boat Festival next year.”\n\n“Gracious!” exclaimed the Lady Dowager. “That’s even more work than building the Garden.”\n\nShe mounted her bamboo sedan-chair again and was carried off, escorted by the rest of the party. They passed Lotus Fragrance Anchorage and made their way down a narrow passage between covered walks which had gate-towers at both ends over the street, with stone tablets let into the walls on both sides. They entered by the west gate, over which the tablet outside was inscribed Cloud Piercer and the one inside Moonshiner. When they reached the hall and entered the main gate facing south, the Lady Dowager alighted and Xichun came out to meet her. A covered walk from the inner court led to her bedroom, under the eaves of which hung a tablet with the inscription Warm Scent Alcove. Some maids raised a scarlet woollen portiere, and they felt a gust of warm air as they entered.\n\nThe Lady Dowager did not sit down but asked Xichun, “How far have you got with the painting?”\n\n“As the weather’s turned cold the glue and colours have congealed,” answered Xichun with a smile. “I was afraid that would make it messy, so I’ve put it away.”\n\n“I want it by New Year,” said the old lady playfully. “Don’t try to get out of it. Bring it out and get on with it.”\n\nJust then they saw Xifeng come in, a purple silk kerchief over her head.\n\n“So this is where you are, Old Ancestress!” she cried gaily. “You sneaked off without a word, and I’ve been searching high and low for you.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager was pleased to see her.\n\n“I was afraid you might get cold, so I told them not to let you know,” she replied. “You little imp, you’ve managed to find me all the same. But you needn’t think this is a way of showing your filial piety.”\n\n“How could I be so filial?” retorted Xifeng. “When I went to your place it was deadly quiet and the young maids wouldn’t tell me where you’d gone. I was puzzling over it when two nuns turned up, and then the truth dawned on me. They must have come to present the list of New Year devotions or ask for their annual donation, and you must be dodging duns because you’re so busy and hard up at the end of the year. I asked them, and sure enough that was it. So I gave them their money and sent them off. Now that your creditors have gone, Old Ancestress, you needn’t hide. I’ve had a tender pheasant prepared; so come back for dinner, or it will be overdone.”\n\nAs she was speaking the others laughed. And without waiting for the old lady’s answer Xifeng told them to bring the sedan-chair. The Lady Dowager, taking her hand and smiling, mounted the chair and was carried off with the rest of the party. They left by the east gate of the passage and saw that the whole landscape was silver with snow. And now they noticed Baoqin in her wild-duck down cape standing on the slope of a hill in the distance, with a maid behind her holding a vase of red plum-blossom.\n\n“So that’s where those two disappeared to!” they cried. “She’s waiting for us here — she’s been picking plum-blossom!”\n\nThe Lady Dowager in high delight exclaimed, “Just look at that snow-covered slope with this girl in the middle, wearing that costume, with the plum-blossom behind her. How pretty it is! Who does she remind you of?”\n\n“She’s like Cousin Qin in that painting in your room, madam,” they answered.\n\nThe old lady shook her head. “That painting doesn’t show a costume like that, and the girl’s not half as pretty.”\n\nEven as she spoke, someone in a red woollen cape emerged from behind Baoqin.\n\n“Who’s that other girl?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“All of us are here,” the others answered. “That must be Baoyu.”\n\n“My eyes are getting dimmer,” chuckled the Lady Dowager.\n\nAs she spoke they drew near and saw that the two were in fact Baoyu and Baoqin.\n\nBaoyu told Baochai and Daiyu with a smile, “I went to Green Lattice Nunnery just now, and Miaoyu is sending you each a spray of plum-blossom. I’ve already sent people to deliver them.”\n\n“Thank you for taking such trouble,” they replied.\n\nBy now they had left the Garden and reached the Lady Dowager’s apartments. After lunch they chatted for a while until Aunt Xue arrived.\n\n“What heavy snow!” she said. “I couldn’t get over all day to pay my respects to you, madam. I hope you’re not feeling too low today? This snow is well worth enjoying.”\n\n“I’m not low-spirited,” said the Lady Dowager. “I sent to ask my grandchildren to come and amuse me for a while.”\n\n“Last night I was thinking of borrowing the Garden from you today to put on a couple of tables of wine and food to ask you over to enjoy the snow,” said Aunt Xue. “But as you retired early, and Baochai told me you were rather out of sorts, I didn’t like to disturb you. If I’d known, I’d have invited you.”\n\n“This is only the first fall of snow this tenth month, there’ll be plenty more later on,” replied the Lady Dowager. “You can treat me then, dear relative, and it won’t be too late.”\n\n“If that’s how it is, you can count on my piety,” said Aunt Xue.\n\nXifeng laughed. “Why don’t you weigh out fifty taels of silver now, aunt, and give it to me to keep? Then each time it snows I’ll prepare a feast for you. You won’t have to trouble and you won’t be able to back out either.”\n\n“That’s right, dear relative,” agreed the Lady Dowager. “Give her fifty taels to keep, and we’ll share it, twenty-five taels each. Then when it snows, I’ll pretend I’m out of sorts and stay at home. You needn’t trouble either, and Xifeng and I will be quids in.”\n\nXifeng clapped her hands and cried, “What a wonderful idea! It’s just what I was thinking.”\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n“For shame!” scolded the Lady Dowager. “You’re climbing up the pole I’ve raised for you! You should have said: Our aunt is our guest, we should put ourselves out for her — how can we let her spend money? If you don’t talk like that, instead of asking shamelessly for fifty taels, you ought to feel thoroughly ashamed of yourself.”\n\nXifeng chuckled, “Our Old Ancestress is certainly sharp-eyed. She was testing you, aunt. If you’d agreed, she’d have shared the fifty taels with me. Now that she sees you won’t fall in with that, she reverses the charges and makes me the scapegoat by talking so magnanimously! Well, I won’t ask you for money, aunt. Instead I’ll pay for a feast for the old lady and give her another fifty taels into the bargain to make up for my officiousness. How about that?”\n\nBefore she could finish, the others were convulsed with laughter.\n\nThen the Lady Dowager described how Baoqin, picking plum-blossom in the snow, had looked lovelier than any picture. She asked her age and all about her family, and Aunt Xue guessed that she had a match in mind for her. This would have suited her, but the girl was already promised to the Mei family. However, as the Lady Dowager had not actually made a proposal, she could not very well bring this up but had to answer half vaguely.\n\n“It’s a pity the child has no fortune,” she said. “Her father died the year before last, and she’s seen a good deal of the world for one so young, having travelled to all the famous mountains and great rivers with her father. He enjoyed pleasuring and, having business in different parts, used to take his family to spend a year in one province, half a year in another. So they must have seen five or six tenths of the empire. That year when they were here he betrothed her to the son of Academician Mei. Then the next year he died, and now her mother’s in poor health too....”\n\nBefore she could say more Xifeng stamped and sighed.\n\n\"How very annoying! I was just thinking of proposing a match, but she's already engaged.\" The Lady Dowager laughed. \"Who did you have in mind for her?\" \"Don't you worry, Old Ancestress. I could see they'd make a perfect couple. But as she's engaged now, there's no point my talking about it.\" Knowing Xifeng's propensity for joking, the old lady dropped the subject when she heard that Baochai was betrothed. After some further chat the party broke up.\n\nNothing happened that evening. The next day the snow had stopped. After breakfast the Lady Dowager ordered Xichun, \"Whether it's cold or not, you must do that painting, but if you can't finish it by New Year so be it. The important thing is to add that picture of Qin and the maid with the plum-blossom, just as it was, without the slightest error, and as quickly as possible.\" Though Xichun found this a tall order, she had to agree. The others went over to watch her paint, but she simply sat there rapt in thought.\n\nLi Wan told the rest, \"Let her think it out by herself while we chat. Yesterday the old lady wanted us to make up some lantern riddles. When I went home, even though Qi and Wen couldn't get to sleep, I made up two based on the Four Books, and each of them made up two too.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" they cried. \"Tell us and we'll guess.\"\n\nLi Wan said, \"'Guanyin has no record of her ancestry.' A line from the Four Books.\"\n\nXiangyun promptly answered, \"'And rest in the highest excellence.'\"\n\nBaochai remonstrated, \"Think again what 'record of her ancestry' means.\"\n\nLi Wan added, \"Yes, think again.\"\n\nDaiyu said, \"I've got it. Isn't it 'Excellent but not proved'?\"\n\nThe others laughed, \"That's it.\"\n\nLi Wan continued, \"'What is the name of the pool overgrown with green grass?'\"\n\nXiangyun interjected, \"It must be 'There is the pu-lu.' Nothing else would fit.\"\n\n\"Good for you,\" said Li Wan. \"Wen's riddle is: 'Water flows by the rocks, sending out cold.' The name of an ancient worthy.\"\n\nTanchun asked, \"Isn't it Shan Tao?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Li Wan. \"And Qi's riddle is the word 'firefly' for a word.\"\n\nWhen nobody could guess this after some thought, Baoqin said, \"This is rather abstruse. I wonder if it isn't the word 'flower'?\"\n\nLi Qi smiled. \"Yes, that's right.\"\n\nThe others asked, \"What has a firefly to do with a flower?\"\n\nDaiyu explained, \"Miraculous! Doesn't a firefly turn into grass?\" Then they saw the point and laughed. \"Good!\"\n\nBaochai observed, \"These are all good but not the sort that will appeal to the old lady. We'd better make up some about common objects so that everybody can enjoy them.\"\n\nThe rest agreed, \"Yes, we must make some about everyday things too.\"\n\nXiangyun thought for a little then said, \"I've composed a song lyric to the tune of Rouged Lips about a common object. See if you can guess it.\" She recited:\n\n\"Parted from the mountain stream,\n\nIt roams the dusty world,\n\nWhat is this futile thing?\n\nFame and gain are in vain;\n\nIt cannot carry on.\"\n\nNone of them could guess it. After some thought one guessed a monk, another a Taoist priest, yet another a puppet-showman. Baoyu after laughing heartily said, \"None of them. I've got it. It must be a performing monkey.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's right,\" said Xiangyun.\n\nThe others asked, \"What does the last line mean?\"\n\n\"Don't all performing monkeys have their tails cut off?\" That made them laugh.\n\n\"She's even made up a riddle that's a hoax,\" they cried.\n\nLi Wan said, \"Aunt Xue was saying yesterday that Qin's seen a lot of the world and travelled widely, so she ought to make up some riddles. And she's good at versifying too. Why not make up a few for us to guess?\"\n\nBaoqin nodded and smiled, then set her mind to it.\n\nOne of them read:\n\nPiled in storeys, carved sandalwood and catalpa frame\nCannot be the work of common artisan.\nThough the storm rages half the day across the sky,\nNo one hears the temple’s wind-bells ring.\n\nWhile the others were puzzling over this, Baoyu had one which he read out:\n\nHeaven and earth are both remote and indistinct,\nBut from fairy precincts take good care to keep aloof.\nWatch out for news by phoenix and crane brought,\nAnd sigh your answer to the blue vault above.\n\nDaiyu had one too. She read out:\n\nWhy should it be tethered with a purple reins?\nGalloping over moats and cities, how it ramps!\nIt will move at its master’s bidding as wind and clouds rise;\nThe three mountains on the turtle’s back have made it famous.\n\nTanchun had one too and was just going to read it out when Baoqin came over.\n“I’ve been to quite a few historic spots in my time,” she said with a smile. “I’ve\npicked out ten of them and written ten poems on the past. They’re rather poor,\nbut they recall old times and each has a riddle about some common object.\nCan you guess them, cousins?”\n\n“This is fun,” cried the rest. “Why not write them out for us?”\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
