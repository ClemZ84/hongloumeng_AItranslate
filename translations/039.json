"话说众人见平儿来了，都说：“你们奶奶做什么呢，怎么不来了？”平儿笑道：“他那里得空儿来？因为说没得好生吃，又不得来，所以叫我来问还有没有，叫我再要几个拿了家去吃罢。”湘云道：“有，多着呢！”忙命人拿盒子装了十个极大的。平儿道：“多拿几个团脐的。”众人又拉平儿坐，平儿不肯，李纨瞅着他笑道：“偏叫你坐！”因拉他身旁坐下，端了一杯酒，送到他嘴边。平儿忙喝了一口，就要走，李纨道：“偏不许你去，显见得你只有凤丫头，就不听我的话了。”说着，又命嬷嬷们：“先送了盒子去，就说我留下平儿了。”那婆子一时拿了盒子回来，说：“二奶奶说：‘叫奶奶和姑娘们别笑话要嘴吃。这个盒子里，方才舅太太那里送来的菱粉糕和鸡油卷儿，给奶奶姑娘们吃的。’”又向平儿道：“说了：‘使唤你来，你就贪住嘴不去了，叫你少喝钟儿罢。’”平儿笑道：“多喝了，又把我怎么样？”一面说，一面只管喝，又吃螃蟹。李纨揽着他笑道：“可惜这么个好体面模样儿，命却平常，只落得屋里使唤。不知道的人，谁不拿你当做奶奶太太看？”平儿一面和宝钗湘云等吃喝着，一面回头笑道：“奶奶，别这么摸的我怪痒痒的。”李氏道：“嗳哟！这硬的是什么？”平儿道：“是钥匙。”李氏道：“有什么要紧的东西怕人偷了去，这么带在身上？我成日家和人说：有个唐僧取经，就有个白马来驮着他；刘智远打天下，就有个瓜精来送盔甲；有个凤丫头，就有个你。你就是你奶奶的一把总钥匙，还要这钥匙做什么？”平儿笑道：“奶奶吃了酒，又拿我来打趣着取笑儿了。”\n　　宝钗笑道：“这倒是真话。我们没事评论起来，你们这几个，都是百个里头挑不出一个来的。妙在各人有各人的好处。”李纨道：“大小都有个天理，比如老太太屋里，要没鸳鸯姑娘，如何使得？从太太起，那一个敢驳老太太的回？他现敢驳回，偏老太太只听他一个人的话。老太太的那些穿带的，别人不记得，他都记得。要不是他经管着，不知叫人诳骗了多少去呢！况且他心也公道，虽然这样，倒常替人上好话儿，还倒不倚势欺人的。”惜春笑道：“老太太昨日还说呢，他比我们还强呢！”平儿道：“那原是个好的，我们那里比得上他？”宝玉道：“太太屋里的彩霞，是个老实人。”探春道：“可不是‘老实’！心里可有数儿呢。太太是那么佛爷似的，事情上不留心，他都知道。凡一应事，都是他提着太太行，连老爷在家出外去的一应大小事，他都知道，太太忘了，他背后告诉太太。”李纨道：“那也罢了。”指着宝玉道：“这一个小爷屋里，要不是袭人，你们度量到个什么田地？凤丫就是个楚霸王，也得两只膀子好举千斤鼎，他不是这丫头，他就是这么周到了？”平儿道：“先时赔了四个丫头来，死的死，去的去，只剩下我一个孤鬼儿了。”李纨道：“你倒是有造化的，凤丫头也是有造化的。想当初你大爷在日，何曾也没两个人？你们看，我还是那容不下人的？天天只是他们不如意，所以你大爷一没了，我趁着年轻都打发了。要是有一个好的守的住，我到底也有个膀臂了。”说着不觉眼圈儿红了。\n　　众人都道：“这又何必伤心，不如散了倒好。”说着，便都洗了手，大家约着往贾母王夫人处问安。众婆子丫头打扫亭子，收洗杯盘。袭人便和平儿一同往前去。袭人因让平儿到屋里坐坐，再喝碗茶去。平儿回说：“不喝茶了，再来罢。”一面说，一面便要出去。袭人又叫住，问道：“这个月的月钱，连老太太、太太屋里还没放，是为什么？”平儿见问，忙转身至袭人跟前，又见无人，俏悄悦道：“你快别问！横竖再迟两天就放了。”袭人笑道：“这是为什么，唬的你这个样儿？”平儿悄声告诉他道：“这个月的月钱，我们奶奶早已支了，放给人使呢。等别处利钱收了来，凑齐了才放呢。因为是你，我才告诉你，可不许告诉一个人去！”袭人笑道：“他难道还短钱使？还没个足厌？何苦还操这心？”平儿笑道：“何曾不是呢。他这几年，只拿着这一项银子翻出有几百来了。他的公费月例又使不着，十两八两零碎攒了，又放出去，单他这体己利钱，一年不到，上千的银子呢。”袭人笑道：“拿着我们的钱，你们主子奴才赚利钱，哄的我们呆等着！”平儿道：“你又说没良心的话，你难道还少钱？”袭人道：“我虽不少，只是我也没处儿使去，就只预备我们那一个。”平儿道：“你倘若有紧要事用银钱使时，我那里还有几两银子，你先拿来使，明日我扣下你的就是了。”袭人道：“此时也用不着。怕一时要用起来不够了，我打发人去取就是了。”\n　　平儿答应着，一径出了园门，只见凤姐那边打发人来找平儿，说：“奶奶有事等你。”平儿道：“有什么事这么要紧？我叫大奶奶拉住说话儿，我又没逃了，这么连三接四的叫人来找！”那丫头说道：“这又不是我的主意，姑娘这话自己和奶奶说去。”平儿哼道：“好了，你们越发上脸了！”说着走来。只见凤姐儿不在屋里，忽见上回来打抽丰的刘老老和板儿来了，坐在那边屋里，还有张材家的周瑞家的陪着。又有两三个丫头在地下，倒口袋里的枣儿、倭瓜并些野菜。众人见他进来，都忙站起来。刘老老因上次来过，知道平儿的身分，忙跳下地来，问：“姑娘好？”又说：“家里都问好。早要来请姑奶奶的安、看姑娘来的，因为庄家忙，好容易今年多打了两石粮食，瓜果菜蔬也丰盛，这是头一起摘下来的，并没敢卖呢，留的尖儿，孝敬姑奶奶、姑娘们尝尝。姑娘们天天山珍海味的，也吃腻了，吃个野菜儿，也算我们的穷心。”平儿忙道：“多谢费心。”又让坐，自己坐了，又让：“张婶子、周大娘坐了。”命小丫头子：“倒茶去。”周瑞、张材两家的因笑道：“姑娘今日脸上有些春色，眼圈儿都红了。”平儿笑道：“可不是，我原不喝，大奶奶和姑娘们只是拉着死灌，不得已喝了两钟，脸就红了。”张材家的笑道：“我倒想着要喝呢，又没人让我。明日再有人请姑娘，可带了我去罢。”说着，大家都笑了。周瑞家的道：“早起我就看见那螃蟹了，一斤只好秤两个三个，这么两三大篓，想是有七八十斤呢。”周瑞家的又道：“要是上上下下，只怕还不够！”平儿道：“那里都吃？不过都是有名儿的吃两个子。那些散众儿的，也有摸着的，也有摸不着的。”刘老老道：“这些螃蟹，今年就值五分一斤，十斤五钱，五五二两五，三五一十五，再搭上酒菜，一共倒有二十多两银子。阿弥陀佛！这一顿的银子，够我们庄家人过一年了！”\n　　平儿因问：“想是见过奶奶了？”刘老老道：“见过了，叫我们等着呢。”说着，又往窗外看天气，说道：“天好早晚了，我们也去罢，别出不去城才是饥荒呢。”周瑞家的道：“等着我替你瞧瞧去。”说着，一径去了，半日方来，笑道：“可是老老的福来了，竟投了这两个人的缘了。”平儿等问：“怎么样？”周瑞家的笑道：“二奶奶在老太太跟前呢，我原是悄悄的告诉二奶奶：‘刘老老要家去呢，怕晚了赶不出城去。’二奶奶说：‘大远的，难为他扛了些东西来，晚了就住一夜，明日再去。’这可不是投上二奶奶的缘了吗？这也罢了，偏老太太又听见了，问：‘刘老老是谁？’二奶奶就回明白了。老太太又说：‘我正想个积古的老人家说话儿，请了来我见见。’这可不是想不到的投上缘了？”说着，催刘老老下来前去。刘老老道：“我这生像儿，怎么见得呢？好嫂子，你就说我去了罢！”平儿忙道：“你快去罢，不相干的。我们老太太最是惜老怜贫的，比不得那个狂三诈四的那些人。想是你怯上，我和周大娘送你去。”说着同周瑞家的带了刘老老往贾母这边来。二门口该班的小厮们，见了平儿出来都站起来，有两个又跑上来，赶着平儿叫“姑娘”。平儿问道：“又说什么？”那小厮笑道：“这会子也好早晚了，我妈病着，等我去请大夫。好姑娘，我讨半日假，可使得？”平儿道：“你们倒好，都商量定了，一天一个，告假又不回奶奶，只和我胡缠。前日住儿去了，二爷偏叫他，叫不着，我应起来了，还说我做了情了。你今日又来了。”周瑞家的道：“当真的他妈病了，姑娘也替他应着放了他罢。”平儿道：“明日一早来。听着，我还要使你呢。再睡的日头晒着屁股再来！你这一去，带个信儿给旺儿，就说奶奶的话，问他那剩的利钱，明日要还不交来，奶奶不要了，索性送他使罢。”那小厮欢天喜地，答应去了。\n　　平儿等来至贾母房中。彼时大观园中姐妹们都在贾母前承奉，刘老老进去，只见满屋里珠围翠绕、花枝招展的，并不知都系何人。只见一张榻上，独歪着一位老婆婆，身后坐着一个纱罗裹的美人一般的个丫鬟在那里捶腿，凤姐儿站着正说笑。刘老老便知是贾母，忙上来，陪着笑，拜了几拜，口里说：“请老寿星安！”贾母也忙欠身问好，又命周瑞家的端过椅子来坐着。那板儿仍是怯人，不知问候。贾母道：“老亲家，你今年多大年纪了？”刘老老忙起身答道：“我今年七十五了。”贾母向众人道：“这么大年纪了，还这么硬朗。比我大好几岁呢！我要到这个年纪，还不知怎么动不得呢。”刘老老笑道：“我们生来是受苦的人，老太太生来是享福的。我们要也这么着，那些庄家活也没人做了。”贾母道：“眼睛牙齿还好？”刘老老道：“还都好，就是今年左边的槽牙活动了。”贾母道：“我老了，都不中用了，眼也花，耳也聋，记性也没了。你们这些老亲戚，我都不记得了。亲戚们来了，我怕人笑话，我都不会。不过嚼的动的吃两口，睡一觉，闷了时和这些孙子孙女儿玩笑会子就完了。”刘老老笑道：“这正是老太太的福了。我们想这么着不能。”贾母道：“什么福，不过是老废物罢咧！”说的大家都笑了。贾母又笑道：“我才听见凤哥儿说，你带了好些瓜菜来，我叫他快收拾去了。我正想个地里现结的瓜儿菜儿吃，外头买的不象你们地里的好吃。”刘老老笑道：“这是野意儿，不过吃个新鲜。依我们倒想鱼肉吃，只是吃不起。”贾母又道：“今日既认着了亲，别空空的就去，不嫌我这里。就住一两天再去。我们也有个园子，园子里头也有果子。你明日也尝尝，带些家去，也算是看亲戚一趟。”凤姐儿见贾母喜欢，也忙留道：“我们这里虽不比你们的场院大，空屋子还有两间，你住两天，把你们那里的新闻故事儿，说些给我们老太太听听。”贾母笑道：“凤丫头别拿他取笑儿，他是屯里人，老实，那里搁的住你打趣？”说着，又命人去先抓果子给板儿吃。板儿见人多了，又不敢吃。贾母又命拿些钱给他，叫小么儿们带他外头玩去。刘老老吃了茶，便把些乡村中所见所闻的事情说给贾母听，贾母越发得了趣味。正说着，凤姐儿便命人请刘老老吃晚饭，贾母又将自己的菜拣了儿样，命人送过去给刘老老吃。\n　　凤姐知道合了贾母的心，吃了饭便又打发过来。鸳鸯忙命老婆子带了刘老老去洗了澡，自己去挑了两件随常的衣裳叫给刘老老换上。那刘老老那里见过这般行事？忙换了衣裳出来，坐在贾母榻前，又搜寻些话出来说。彼时宝玉姐妹们也都在这里坐着，他们何曾听见过这些话，自觉比那些瞽目先生说的书还好听。那刘老老虽是个村野人，却生来的有些见识，况且年纪老了，世情上经历过的，见头一件贾母高兴，第二件这些哥儿姐儿都爱听，便没话也编出些话来讲。因说道：“我们村庄上种地种菜，每年每日，春夏秋冬，风里雨里，那里有个坐着的空儿？天天都是在那地头上做歇马凉亭，什么奇奇怪怪的事不见呢！就象旧年冬天，接连下了几天雪，地下压了三四尺深。我那日起的早，还没出屋门，只听外头柴草响，我想着必定有人偷柴草来了。我巴着窗户眼儿一瞧，不是我们村庄上的人……”贾母道：“必定是过路的客人们冷了，见现成的柴火抽些烤火，也是有的。”刘老老笑道：“也并不是客人，所以说来奇怪。老寿星打量什么人？原来是一个十七八岁极标致的个小姑娘儿，梳着溜油儿光的头，穿着大红袄儿，白绫子裙儿。”刚说到这里，忽听外面人吵嚷起来，又说：“不相干，别唬着老太太！”贾母等听了，忙问：“怎么了？”丫鬟回说：“南院子马棚里走了水了，不相干，已经救下去了。”贾母最胆小的，听了这话，忙起身扶了人出至廊上来瞧时，只见那东南角上火光犹亮。贾母唬得口内念佛，又忙命人去火神跟前烧香。王夫人等也忙都过来请安，回说：“已经救下去了。老太太请进去罢。”贾母足足的看着火光熄了，方领众人进来。\n　　宝玉且忙问刘老老：“那女孩儿大雪地里做什么抽柴火？倘或冻出病来呢？”贾母道：“都是才说抽柴火，惹出事来了，你还问呢！别说这个了，说别的罢。“宝玉听说，心内虽不乐，也只得罢了。刘老老便又想了想，说道：“我们庄子东边庄上有个老奶奶子，今年九十多岁了。他天天吃斋念佛，谁知就感动了观音菩萨，夜里来托梦，说：‘你这么虚心，原来你该绝后的，如今奏了玉皇，给你个孙子。’原来这老奶奶只有一个儿子，这儿子也只一个儿子，好容易养到十七八岁上死了，哭的什么儿似的。后起间，真又养了一个，今年才十三四岁，长得粉团儿似的，聪明伶俐的了不得呢。这些神佛是有的不是！”这一席话，暗合了贾母、王夫人的心事，连王夫人也都听住了。\n　　宝玉心中只惦记抽柴的事，因闷的心中筹画。探春因问他：“昨日扰了史大妹妹，咱们回去商议着邀一社，又还了席，也请老太太赏菊何如？”宝玉笑道：“老太太说了，还要摆酒还史妹妹的席，叫咱们做陪呢。等吃了老太太的，咱们再请不迟。”探春道：“越往前越冷了，老太太未必高兴。”宝玉道：“老太太又喜欢下雨下雪的，咱们等下头场雪，请老太太赏雪不好吗？咱们雪下吟诗，也更有趣了。”黛玉笑道：“咱们雪下吟诗，依我说，还不如弄一捆柴火，雪下抽柴，还更有趣儿呢！”说着，宝钗等都笑了。宝玉瞅了他一眼，也不答话。\n　　一时散了，背地里宝玉到底拉了刘老老，细问那女孩儿是谁。刘老老只得编了告诉他：“那原是我们庄子北沿儿地埂子上，有个小祠堂儿，供的不是神佛，当先有个什么老爷……”说着，又想名姓。宝玉道：“不拘什么名姓，也不必想了，只说原故就是了。”刘老老道：“这老爷没有儿子，只有一位小姐，名字叫什么若玉，知书儿识字的，老爷太太爱的象珍珠儿。可惜了儿的，这小姐儿长到十七岁了，一病就病死了。”宝玉听了，跌足叹惜，又问：“后来怎么样？”刘老老道：“因为老爷太太疼的心肝儿似的，盖了那祠堂，塑了个像儿，派了人烧香儿拨火的。如今年深日久，人也没了，庙也烂了，那泥胎儿可就成了精咧。”宝玉忙道：“不是成精，规矩这样人是不死的。”刘老老道：“阿弥陀佛！是这么着吗？不是哥儿说，我们还当他成了精了呢。他时常变了人出来闲逛。我才说抽柴火的，就是他了。我们村庄上的人商量着还要拿榔头砸他呢。”宝玉忙道：“快别如此。要平了庙，罪过不小！”刘老老道：“幸亏哥儿告诉我，明日回去，拦住他们就是了。”宝玉道：“我们老太太、太太都是善人，就是合家大小也都好善喜舍，最爱修庙塑神的。我明日做一个疏头，替你化些布施，你就做香头，攒了钱，把这庙修盖，再装塑了泥像，每月给你香火钱烧香，好不好？”刘老老道：“若这样时，我托那小姐的福，也有几个钱使了。”宝玉又问他地名庄名，来往远近，坐落何方，刘老老便顺口诌了出来。\n    宝玉信以为真，回至房中，盘算了一夜。次日一早，便出来给了焙茗几百钱，按着刘老老说的方向地名，着焙茗去先踏看明白，回来再作主意。那焙茗去后，宝玉左等也不来，右等也不来，急的热地里蚰蜒似的。好容易等到日落，方见焙茗兴兴头头的回来了。宝玉忙问：“可找着了？”焙茗笑道：“爷听的不明白，叫我好找！那地名坐落，不象爷听的一样，所以找了一天，找到东北角田埂子上，才有一个破庙。”宝玉听说，喜的眉开眼笑，忙说道：“刘老老有年纪的人，一时错记了也是有的。你且说你见的。”焙茗道：“那庙门却倒也朝南开，也是稀破的。我找的正没好气，一见这个，我说可好了，连忙进去。一看泥胎，唬的我又跑出来了，活象真的似的！”宝玉喜的笑道：“他能变化人了，自然有些生气。”焙茗拍手道：“那里是什么女孩儿？竟是一位青脸红发的瘟神爷！”宝玉听了，啐了一口，骂道：“真是个没用的杀材，这点子事也干不来！”焙茗道：“爷又不知看了什么书，或者听了谁的混账语，信真了，把这件没头脑的事派我去碰头。怎么说我没用呢？”宝玉见他急了，忙抚慰他道：“你别急，改日闲了，你再找去。要是他哄我们呢，自然没了，要竟是有的，你岂不也积了阴骘呢？我必重重的赏你。”说着，只见二门上的小厮来说：“老太太屋里的姑娘们站在二门口找二爷呢。”\n不知何事，下回分解。",
  "translation": "When Pinger appeared they asked, “What’s your mistress doing that she can’t come?”\n\n“How could she find time?” Pinger smiled. “She says she didn’t have a chance to eat properly just now, and as she can’t come she’s sent me to ask whether there are any crabs left. If so, I’m to take some home for her.”\n\n“There are plenty,” Xiangyun assured her, and ordered the maids to fetch a hamper and pack ten of the largest in it.\n\n“Bring more females,” Pinger told the maid.\n\nThe others invited Pinger to sit down with them, but she declined.\n\n“I insist,” said Li Wan, smiling as she shot her a glance. She made Pinger sit down beside her and offered her a cup of wine, which she held to her lips.\n\nPinger took a sip, then rose to go.\n\n“I won’t hear of your leaving,” cried Li Wan. “It’s clear you only obey Xifeng and don’t care for me.” She told the serving-women, “Take this hamper along first and say that I’m keeping Pinger here.”\n\nThe woman soon came back to report, “Madam Lian says: ‘Please don’t laugh at me, madam and young ladies, for being such a greedy-guts. In this hamper are some water-chestnut cakes and chicken-fat rolls just sent by Her Ladyship’s sister-in-law for you all to taste.’” She turned to Pinger. “She says: ‘When I send you on an errand, you stay to enjoy yourself instead of coming back. Mind you don’t drink too much.’”\n\n“What if I do?” Pinger laughed. But she went on drinking and eating crab with the rest.\n\n“It’s a shame,” said Li Wan, putting an arm around her. “So handsome and such a good sort, yet fated to be a servant. Anyone who didn’t know you would take you for one of the ladies of the house.”\n\nPinger, who was eating and drinking with Baochai and Xiangyun, turned to laugh, “Don’t do that, madam, it tickles.”\n\n“Gracious! What’s this hard thing?”\n\n“The keys.”\n\n“What valuable things are you afraid of people stealing that you carry them about with you? I’m always saying, when the Tang Monk went to fetch the scriptures he had the white dragon horse to carry him; when Liu Zhiyuan conquered the empire a melon spirit presented him with a suit of armour; and to help Xifeng, there’s you. You’re your mistress’ master-key. What do you want with these keys?”\n\n“You’ve been drinking, madam, and now you’re making fun of me.”\n\n“That’s the truth,” put in Baochai. “Whenever we’ve nothing better to do and start comparing notes, we all agree that the few of you are each one in a hundred, each in her own way wonderful.”\n\n“There’s reason in all things,” observed Li Wan. “For instance, what would our Old Ancestress do without Yuanyang? Not even Her Ladyship dares cross the old lady, yet Yuanyang does and gets away with it. The old lady only listens to her. She remembers all the old lady’s clothes and trinkets which the others forget. If she didn’t keep an eye on them, goodness knows how many would be embezzled. And she’s fair-minded too. Instead of throwing her weight about she often puts in a good word for others.”\n\n“The old lady was saying only yesterday that she’s better than us,” Xichun told them.\n\n“She’s good, that’s a fact,” said Pinger. “We’re no match for her.”\n\n“Caixia in Her Ladyship’s place is a decent sort,” volunteered Baoyu.\n\n“Decent?” Tanchun giggled. “She has plenty of savvy. Her Ladyship’s such a Buddha, she doesn’t bother about anything; but Caixia knows all that’s going on. She has to remind Her Ladyship of everything, even the different affairs, big and small, of the master at home and outside. If Her Ladyship forgets something, she reminds her later in private.”\n\n“That’s all right too.” Li Wan pointed at Baoyu. “In this young\n\nInside the pavilion Xiren remarked, “If it hadn’t been for Pinger, goodness knows what state you’d be in! Even Xifeng, for all her bluster, needs helpers. She couldn’t manage without a good girl like this to see to everything for her so well.”\n\n“To start with they gave her four maids,” said Pinger. “But two died and two left, so now I’m the only one left, all on my own.”\n\n“You’re lucky, and so is Xifeng,” observed Li Wan. “When my husband was alive I had a few maids too, you know. But as you can see, I’m not the hard-hearted type. They were never satisfied, though, so after his death, while I was still young, I let them all go. If there’d been one good one I could have kept, I’d have had a helpmate.”\n\nHer eyes reddened as she spoke.\n\n“Why be so sad?” cried the others. “Let’s break up now.”\n\nThey washed their hands then and went in a group to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, while the serving-women and maids cleared the pavilion and cleaned the cups and dishes. Xiren and Pinger went ahead of the rest.\n\nXiren invited Pinger to her room to rest and have some tea.\n\n“No thanks, not now,” said Pinger. “I’ll come another time.” She would have gone on, but Xiren stopped her to ask, “Why hasn’t this month’s allowance been issued yet, even in the old lady’s and mistress’ apartments?”\n\nPinger turned back at that and, seeing that there was no one else about, whispered, “Don’t ask. It’ll be issued in a couple of days at most.”\n\n“Why are you so scared, just at the mention of that?”\n\n“Our mistress drew the money early this month and is lending it out at interest. She won’t issue it till she’s collected enough interest from other places to make up the sum. I’m only telling you this because I can trust you, but mind you don’t breathe a word to anyone.”\n\n“Is she short of money that she’s not satisfied with all she has, but must go to such trouble?”\n\n“Of course not. In the last few years she’s turned this monthly allowance over again and again to make several hundred taels extra. She doesn’t need her own allowance, and puts by ten or eight taels at a time to lend out at interest. So just from her private savings she makes nearly a thousand taels a year.”\n\n“So you and your mistress are making money out of our allowance, while we have to wait patiently!”\n\n“Don’t be so ungrateful,” scolded Pinger playfully. “Aren’t you well provided for?”\n\n“I’m not badly off, but I’ve nowhere to spend money and I’m just saving for him.”\n\n“If you need money urgently, I’ve a few taels you can have. Pay me back later.”\n\n“No, I don’t need any at the moment. If I find I’m short I’ll send to you for some.”\n\nPinger assented and was leaving the Garden when a maid sent by Xifeng accosted her.\n\n“The mistress wants you,” she said. “She has some business.”\n\n“What business can be so urgent?” demanded Pinger. “I was kept talking by the elder mistress, it’s not as if I’d run away. Why keep sending to hurry me?”\n\n“Don’t blame me, miss. You’d better ask the mistress that.”\n\n“All right, don’t you start throwing your weight about!” Pinger snorted.\n\nShe found that Xifeng was not in her room, but Granny Liu and Baner were there again, sitting in the inner room with the wives of Zhang Cai and Zhou Rui. A few maids were there too, emptying dates, pumpkins and some wild vegetables out of sacks. The whole group stood up at Pinger’s entrance.\n\nRecognising Pinger, she jumped down from the kang to greet her.\n\n“How are you, miss?” she asked. “All your family send their love. I’ve been meaning to come to pay my respects to Her Ladyship and see you, miss, but with all the work on the farm I’d no time to spare. This year, by good luck, we’ve had a bumper harvest of grain and plenty of fruit and vegetables too. These we’ve picked first and not ventured to sell, but kept the best for Her Ladyship and the young ladies to taste. You’re used to eating dainties every day, miss; but try our country fare for a change. It’s a poor gift, but given with good will.”\n\n“Many thanks for your kindness,” replied Pinger.\n\nShe invited them to sit down and sat down herself, then called to a young maid to serve tea.\n\n“Your face is flushed today, miss,” remarked Mrs. Chou and Mrs. Chang. “Your eyes are rather red too.”\n\n“Yes,” Pinger laughed. “I didn’t want to drink at first, but the mistress and young ladies insisted on making me toss off a few cups, so of course I’ve got flushed.”\n\n“I wish someone would ask me to drink,” said Mrs. Chang. “But nobody ever does. Next time there’s a drinking party, miss, take me along to have some fun.”\n\nThis set them all laughing.\n\n“I saw the crabs this morning,” said Mrs. Chou. “They must weigh two or three to the catty. And there are two or three large hampers of them — seventy or eighty catties at least.”\n\n“Even so, there may not be enough for all the people high and low in this household.”\n\n“What an idea!” Pinger chuckled. “Only those whose names count will get any. The rest will just have to put up with it — if they get any, well and good; if not, hard luck.”\n\n“Those crabs cost five cents a catty this year,” put in Granny Liu. “Fifty cents for ten catties, and for fifty catties that’s two and a half taels; add another one and a half taels for fifteen catties, that makes four taels; and with the wine and food, another seven or eight taels at least. Gracious Buddha! That would be enough to keep our farm going for a year!”\n\n“I suppose you’ve seen Her Ladyship?” Pinger asked her.\n\n“Yes, she told us to wait.”\n\nGranny Liu glanced out of the window.\n\n“It’s getting late,” she said. “We must be going or we’ll be shut out of the city. That would be a fine how-do-you-do.”\n\n“Just wait while I go and see,” offered Mrs. Chou.\n\nShe was gone for some time and when she came back she beamed, “Well, granny, your luck’s in. The two ladies have both taken a fancy to you.”\n\n“What’s up?” asked Pinger.\n\n“Her Ladyship’s with the old lady,” Mrs. Chou told her. “I slipped in quietly to tell her, ‘Granny Liu wants to leave for fear of being shut out.’ Her Ladyship said, ‘It was good of her to come all this way with presents. If it’s too late, she must stay the night and go tomorrow.’ Wasn’t that kind of her? But then the old lady overheard and asked, ‘Who is this Granny Liu?’ So Her Ladyship explained. And the old lady said, ‘I’ve been wanting to meet some old experienced country folk for a chat. Ask her over.’ This is an unexpected piece of luck, isn’t it?”\n\nShe urged Granny Liu to go at once. But the old woman held back.\n\n“What! A creature like me going to see the old lady?” she demurred.\n\n“Do go, good sister, and say I’ve left.”\n\n“Hurry up,” Pinger urged her. “It doesn’t matter. Our old lady’s the kindest-hearted soul on earth; she’s not one of those pompous, tricky people. I know you’re shy. Mrs. Chou and I will go with you.”\n\nSo taking Granny Liu they went to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. The pages on duty at the inner gate rose to their feet as Pinger came out, and two of them ran over to her.\n\n“Miss!” they called.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\n“It’s getting rather late now.”\n\n“My mother’s ill and I’ve got to fetch the doctor,” he said. “Do let me off for half a day, there’s a kind young lady.”\n\n“You’re a fine lot,” scolded Pinger. “You fix it up nicely between you, one asking for leave one day and another the next, but instead of telling the mistress you just come and bother me. The other day Zhu’er slipped off, and when the master happened to ask for him and he wasn’t there, I had to take the blame; and then I was accused of being too soft-hearted. And now here you are again.”\n\n“His mother really is ill,” Zhou Rui’s wife put in. “Do let him off, miss.”\n\n“All right, but mind you come back first thing tomorrow,” said Pinger. “And listen. I shall be needing you. If you don’t come back till the sun’s frying your behind, that won’t do. And while you’re out, take a message from the mistress to Wang’er. She wants to know why that interest hasn’t been paid yet. If it’s not here tomorrow, she says, he needn’t trouble to pay it at all — he can keep it for himself.”\n\nThe boy assented cheerfully and ran off.\n\nPinger and the others then went to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. All the young ladies in the Garden were waiting on the old lady, and when Granny Liu was ushered in she saw, amidst a bevy of fashionably dressed girls, an old lady propped up on a couch with a silk-covered pillow behind her. A beautiful maid in a muslin tunic was gently pounding her legs. Xifeng was standing by the couch cracking jokes. Assuming that this must be the Lady Dowager, Granny Liu hurried forward to pay her respects with a curtsey.\n\n“Greetings, Buddha of Long Life!” she cried.\n\nThe Lady Dowager made an effort to rise and murmured, “How do you do, sister?” then ordered Zhou Rui’s wife to bring a chair for their visitor to sit on.\n\nBan’er, being shy, was still too overawed to greet the old lady.\n\n“How old are you, my dear relative?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\nGranny Liu rose to her feet.\n\n“Seventy-five this year.”\n\n“So old, yet so hale and hearty!” The Lady Dowager turned to the others. “At my age I’m older than she is by several years, but I’m so crippled with rheumatism that I can’t move. It’s not fair.”\n\n“We’re born to work, madam, you to enjoy good fortune,” replied Granny Liu. “If all of us were like you, who’d work on the land?”\n\n“How are your eyes and teeth?”\n\n“They’re all right. It’s just that this year one of my back teeth has come loose.”\n\n“I’m no good for anything any more — my eyes are going, my ears are deaf and my memory’s failing,” said the Lady Dowager. “I can’t even remember my old relations. I’m afraid of people laughing at me when they call, as I can’t entertain them properly. All I do is eat a few mouthfuls of whatever I can chew, take a nap, and when I feel bored amuse myself a bit with my grandchildren.”\n\n“That’s your good fortune, madam. We’d like that too, but we can’t have it.”\n\n“Good fortune? I’m just a useless old creature.”\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n“Just now Xifeng told me you’d brought us some pumpkins and vegetables,” continued the Lady Dowager. “I’ve told them to prepare them at once. I’ve been thinking of some freshly picked field produce, but you can’t get anything so good in town as what you grow in the country.”\n\n“That’s rough country fare,” said Granny Liu. “We just brought it to show our respect. We’d like to eat meat too, but we can’t afford it.”\n\n“Now that we’re relatives, you mustn’t go back empty-handed,” said the Lady Dowager. “If you don’t think my place too shabby, do stay a couple of days. We’ve a garden here too with fruit in it, and you must try some tomorrow and take some home with you to show that you’ve visited your relatives.”\n\nXifeng, seeing how pleased the old lady was, urged Granny Liu to stay.\n\n“Our place is not as big as your farmyard,” she said, “but we’ve a couple of empty rooms. You rest here for a couple of days and tell our Old Ancestress some of your country tales — that will amuse her.”\n\n“Don’t make fun of her, Xifeng,” said the Lady Dowager. “She’s a country woman and may take you seriously.”\n\nShe also told the maids to give Baner some sweetmeats first. But the child, finding himself the focus of attention, dared not eat.\n\nThe Lady Dowager then ordered some cash to be given him and sent some pages to take him out to play.\n\nAfter sipping her tea, Granny Liu regaled the old lady with stories of country life, and the Lady Dowager enjoyed this so much that she was still listening with relish when Xifeng sent to invite the old woman to dinner. The Lady Dowager selected some of her own dishes as well to be sent to her.\n\nXifeng, knowing how much the old lady was enjoying Granny Liu’s visit, after dinner sent the country woman back to her again. Yuanyang at once ordered an old nurse to take her off to have a bath, and herself chose two everyday clothes for her to change into. Having no experience of such ways, Granny Liu after her bath changed quickly into these clothes and came out to seat herself on the edge of the Lady Dowager’s couch. Once more she started telling them stories.\n\nBaoyu and the girls happened to be there too, and they had never heard such tales before, finding them even more entertaining than the stories of blind ballad-singers. Although Granny Liu was a simple country woman, she had seen a good deal of life in her time and being old was able to draw on a fund of experience. And as the old lady was enjoying her talk and the young people liked listening too, she made up some stories for their benefit.\n\n“In our village we farm all the year round,” she said. “Spring, summer, autumn and winter, in wind or rain, we’ve no time to sit idle. And every day we rest in a wayside pavilion on the edge of the fields — you’d be surprised at the strange things we see. One winter, for instance, when it had been snowing hard for several days and the snow was three or four feet deep, I got up early and before leaving the house heard a rustling in the faggot pile outside. I thought someone must be stealing our firewood, but when I peeped through a crack in the window, it wasn’t one of our villagers....”\n\n“It must have been some traveller feeling cold and helping himself to your firewood to make a fire,” suggested the Lady Dowager. “That does happen sometimes.”\n\n“No, it wasn’t a traveller.” Granny Liu chuckled. “That’s what was so strange. Who do you think it was, Old Goddess of Longevity? A beautiful girl of seventeen or eighteen with her hair done up in a glossy bun, wearing a red jacket and a white silk skirt....”\n\nAt this point a commotion broke out outside and someone cried, “It’s nothing serious! Don’t frighten the old lady!”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the others had turned to look out when some maids ran in to announce, “The ma stables in the south court have caught fire, but it’s all right now. The fire has been put out.”\n\nThe old lady, a timorous woman, was on her feet in consternation and let the maids help her out to the verandah. Seeing flames still leaping up from the southeast corner, she invoked Buddha in terror and ordered incense to be burned at once to the God of Fire. Lady Wang and the others hurried over to reassure her.\n\n“The fire is out now,” they said. “Please go back inside, madam.”\n\nNot until the flames had died down completely did the old lady lead the others back into the room.\n\nBaoyu meanwhile was eagerly questioning Granny Liu. “What did that girl want, taking faggots in the snow? She might have caught cold and fallen ill.”\n\n“It was your talk about taking faggots that started this fire,” scolded his grandmother. “And still you keep on about it. Change the subject. Don’t talk about that any more.”\n\nBaoyu had to drop the subject, much as it intrigued him.\n\nThen Granny Liu thought up another story.\n\n“East of our village,” she said, “lives an old woman in her nineties who fasts and prays every day to Buddha. She’s so pious that the Goddess of Mercy was touched and sent her a dream one night. ‘You deserve to have no descendants,’ she told her, ‘but because you’ve been so devout we’ve petitioned the Jade Emperor to give you a grandson.’\n\n“This old woman had only one son, and he in turn had only one son. But after they’d managed to bring the boy up to the age of seventeen or eighteen, he died. That nearly broke their hearts....”\n\nJust then the old woman really did have another grandchild, a girl of thirteen or fourteen, plump as a ball of dough and as clever as can be. So there must be some truth in these tales about gods and Buddhas.”\n\nThis story appealed to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, who listened attentively.\n\nBaoyu, however, was simply thinking of the firewood-gathering, and he was turning this over in his mind when Tanchun asked him, “We put Cousin Shi to so much trouble yesterday, don’t you think we should get up a poetry club to return the invitation and ask the old lady to come and enjoy the chrysanthemums?”\n\n“The old lady says she means to give a return feast for her and wants us to keep her company,” he answered. “We can invite her to one of our feasts later.”\n\n“It’s getting colder every day, and the old lady may not like going out.”\n\n“But she enjoys rain or snow. Why not wait till we have a good fall of snow and ask her to come to a snow party? We can compose poems in the snow — won’t that be more fun?”\n\nDaiyu laughed.\n\n“Why not get a bundle of firewood and do our composing while we gather it in the snow? Wouldn’t that be more amusing still?”\n\nAt that Baochai and the others laughed, while Baoyu shot Daiyu a glance but said nothing.\n\nSoon they dispersed, and Baoyu waylaid Granny Liu to question her closely about the girl. The old woman had to invent an answer.\n\n“North of our village,” she said, “there’s a small temple by the roadside. It isn’t dedicated to any god or Buddha, but to a spirit. There was once a gentleman...” She broke off to think of a name.\n\n“Never mind the name. Just tell me what happened.”\n\n“This gentleman had no son, just one daughter called Ruoyu. She could read and write, and her parents loved her dearly. But she fell ill and died when she was just seventeen. Her parents were heart-broken and had this temple built with a statue of her. They appointed people to burn incense and tend the fire. But as time went by the attendants died or left, and the temple fell into decay. That clay image then became an elf.”\n\n“It doesn’t turn into an elf. Such people don’t really die,” Baoyu assured her eagerly.\n\n“Gracious Buddha! So that’s the way it is. If you hadn’t told me, sir, I’d have taken it for an elf. She often appears in human form and goes shopping in the village. It was her I was talking about just now when I spoke of gathering firewood. Some of our villagers mean to smash that statue.”\n\n“Don’t let them do that!” cried Baoyu in horror. “It would be a terrible sin to destroy a temple.”\n\n“Luckily you’ve told me, young master. I’ll stop them when I go back.”\n\n“Our old lady and my mother are both pious people who love doing good deeds and building or repairing temples. I’ll write out a subscription list tomorrow to raise money, and you can be the head and collect donations to have this temple repaired and the statue renovated. Then every month we’ll give you money for incense. How about that?”\n\n“In that case I’ll have some money to spend, thanks to that young lady.”\n\nBaoyu also asked the name of the village and how far it was, and the old woman made up some answer.\n\nTaking all this seriously, Baoyu went back to his room and spent the whole night turning it over in his mind. The next morning he slipped out and gave Beiming a few hundred cash, telling him to go first to the place described by Granny Liu to make sure of the lie of the land. Then they could decide what to do. But after Beiming had left, Baoyu waited for him in vain. He was on tenterhooks.\n\nHe waited impatiently till sunset when Beiming came back in high spirits.\n\n“Well, did you find her?” Baoyu asked eagerly.\n\n“It was your fault for not hearing clearly, sir, that made me search for so long,” chuckled Beiming. “The location and name weren’t what you said. I looked the whole day, and finally on a ridge in the northeast corner I came across a broken-down temple.”\n\nBaoyu was overjoyed.\n\n“Granny Liu’s old, she must have misremembered,” he cried. “But tell me what you found.”\n\n“The temple gate faces south as she said, but it’s falling to pieces. I was so annoyed, but when I saw it I thought, ‘Good, this must be the place.’ I hurried in and the sight of that clay idol scared me so much I beat a retreat. It looked just like a live one!”\n\n“If she can take human form, of course she’s full of life,” Baoyu exclaimed gleefully.\n\n“It wasn’t any girl,” cried Beiming, clapping his hands. “It was a god of plague with a blue face and red hair!”\n\nBaoyu spat in disgust.\n\n“What a useless fool you are!” he swore. “You can’t even do a simple thing like this.”\n\n“You must have been taken in by some book you’d read or some nonsense you heard, sir, sending me off on a wild-goose chase like this. How can you say I’m useless?”\n\nSeeing that Beiming was upset, Baoyu soothed him:\n\n“Don’t be angry. You can go another day when you’ve time. If she was fooling us, of course there’s nothing to be found; but if the shrine is really there, this will win you secret merit and I’ll reward you handsomely.”\n\nJust then a servant from the inner gate came in.\n\n“The young ladies from the old lady’s apartments are at the inner gate asking for Master Bao,” he announced.\n\nTo know what they wanted, read the next chapter."
