  "original": "却说贾珍、贾琏暗暗预备下大笸箩的钱，听见贾母说赏，忙命小厮们快撒钱，只听满台钱响，贾母大悦。二人遂起身，小厮们将一把新暖银壶捧来，递与贾琏手内，随了贾珍趋至里面。贾珍先到李婶娘席上，躬身取下杯来，回身，贾琏忙斟了一盏，然后便至薛姨妈席上也斟了。二人忙起来笑说：“二位爷请坐着罢了，何必多礼。”于是除邢、王二夫人，满席都离了席，也俱垂手旁站。贾珍等至贾母榻前，因榻矮，二人便屈膝跪了，贾珍在前捧杯，贾琏在后捧壶。虽只二人捧酒，那贾琮弟兄等却都是一溜排班随着他二人进来，见他二人跪下，都一溜跪下。宝玉也忙跪下。湘云悄推他，笑道：“你这会子又帮着跪下做什么？有这么着的呢，你也去斟一巡酒岂不好。”宝玉悄笑道：“再等一会再斟去。”说着，等他二人斟完，起来，又给邢王二夫人斟过了。贾珍笑说：“妹妹们怎么着呢？”贾母等都说道：“你们去罢，他们倒便宜些呢。”贾珍等方退出。\n　　当下天有二鼓，戏演的是《白义·观灯》八出，正在热闹之际。宝玉因下席往外走。贾母问：“往那里去？外头炮仗利害，留神天上吊下火纸来烧着。”宝玉笑回说：“不往远去，只出去就来。”贾母命婆子们：“好生跟着。”于是宝玉出来，只有麝月、秋纹几个小丫头随着。贾母因说：“袭人怎么不见？他如今也有些拿大了，单支使小女孩儿出来。”王夫人忙起身笑说道：“他妈前日没了，因有热孝，不便前头来。”贾母点头，又笑道：“跟主子，却讲不起这孝与不孝。要是他还跟我，难道这会子也不在这里？这些竟成了例了。”凤姐儿忙过来笑回道：“今晚便没孝，那园子里头也须得看着灯烛花爆，最是担险的。这里一唱戏，园子里的谁不来偷瞧瞧，他还细心，各处照看。况且这一散后，宝兄弟回去睡觉，各色都是齐全的。若他再来了，众人又不经心，散了回去，铺盖也是冷的，茶水也不齐全，便各色都不便宜，自然我叫他不用来。老祖宗要叫他来，我就叫他就是了。”贾母听了这话，忙悦：“你这话很是，你必想的周到，快别叫他了。但只他妈几时没了，我怎么不知道？”凤姐儿笑道：“前儿袭人去亲自回老太太的，怎么倒忘了？”贾母想了想，笑道：“想起来了。我的记性竟平常了。”众人都笑说：“老太太那里记得这些事。”贾母因又叹道：“我想着他从小儿伏侍我一场，又伏侍了云儿，末后给了个魔王，给他魔了这好几年。他又不是咱们家根生土长的奴才，没受过咱们什么大恩典，他娘没了，我想着要给他几两银子发送他娘，也就忘了。”凤姐儿道：“前儿太太赏了他四十两银子，就是了。”贾母听说，点头道：“这还罢了。正好前儿鸳鸯的娘也死了，我想他老子娘都在南边，我也没叫他家去守孝。如今他两处全礼，何不叫他二人一处作伴去？”又命婆子拿些果子菜馔点心之类与他二人吃去。琥珀笑道：“还等这会子？他早就去了。”说着，大家又吃酒看戏。\n　　且说宝玉一径来至园中，众婆子见他回房，便不跟去，只坐在园门里茶房里烤火，和管茶的女人偷空饮酒斗牌。宝玉至院中，虽是灯火灿烂，却无人声。麝月道：“他们都睡了不成？咱们悄悄进去吓他们一跳。”于是大家蹑手蹑脚，潜踪进镜壁去一看，只见袭人和一个人对歪在地炕上，那一头有两个老嬷嬷打吨。宝玉只当地两个睡着了，才要进去，忽听鸳鸯嗽了一声，说道：“天下事可知难定。论理你单身在这里，父母在外头，每年他们东去西来，没个定准，想来你是再不能送终的了，偏生今年就死在这里，你倒出去送了终。”袭人道：“正是，我也想不到能够看着父母殡殓。回了太太；又赏了四十两银子，这倒也算养我一场，我也不敢妄想了。”宝玉听了，忙转身悄向麝月等道：“谁知他也来了。我这一进去，他又赌气走了，不如咱们回去罢，让他两个清清净净的说话。袭人正在那里闷着，幸他来的好。”说着，仍悄悄出来。宝玉便走过山石后去，站着撩衣。麝月、秋纹皆站住，背过脸去，口内笑说：“蹲下再解小衣，留神风吹了肚子。”后面两个小丫头知是小解，忙先出去茶房内预备水去了。\n　　这里宝玉刚过来，只见两个媳妇迎面来了，又问：“是谁？”秋纹道：“宝玉在这里呢，大呼小叫，留神吓着罢！”那媳妇们忙笑道：“我们不知，大节下来惹祸了。姑娘们可连日辛苦了！”说着，已到跟前。麝月等问：“手里拿着什么？”媳妇道：“是老太太赏金、花二位姑娘吃的。”秋纹笑道：“外头唱的是《八义》。没唱《混元盒》，那里又跑出‘金花娘娘’来了？”宝玉命：“揭起来我瞧瞧。”秋纹、麝月忙上去将两个盒子揭开，两个媳妇忙蹲下身子。宝玉看了两个盒内都是席上所有的上等果品茶点，点了一点头就走。麝月等忙胡乱掷了盒盖跟上来。宝玉笑道：“这两个女人倒和气，会说话。他们天天乏了，倒说你们连日辛苦，倒不是那矜功自伐的。”麝月道：“这两个就好，那不知理的是太不知理。”宝玉道：“你们是明白人，担待他们是粗夯可怜的人就完了。”一面说，一面走出了园门。那几个婆子虽吃酒斗牌，却不住出来打探，见宝玉出来，也都跟上来。到了花厅廊上，只见那两个小丫头，一个捧着个小盆，又一个搭着手巾，又拿着沤子小壶儿，在那里久等。秋纹先忙伸手向盆内试了试，说道：“你越大越粗心了，那里弄得这冷水？”小丫头笑道：“姑娘瞧瞧，这个天，我怕水冷，倒的是滚水，这还冷了。”正说着，可巧见一个老婆子提着一壶滚水走来，小丫头就说：“好奶奶，过来给我倒上些水。”那婆子道：“姐姐，这是老太太沏茶的，劝你去舀罢，那里就走大了脚呢？”秋纹道：“不管你是谁的，你不给我，管把老太太的茶铞子倒了洗手！”那婆子回头见了秋纹，忙提起壶来倒了些。秋纹道：“够了，你这么大年纪，也没见识。谁不知是老太太的，要不着的就敢要了？”婆子笑道：“我眼花了，没认出这姑娘来。”宝玉洗了手，那小丫头子拿小壶儿倒了沤子在他手内，宝玉沤了。秋纹麝月也趁热水洗了一会，跟进宝玉来。\n　　宝玉便要了一壶暖酒，也从李婶娘斟起。他二人也笑让坐。贾母便说：“他小人家儿，让他斟去。大家倒要干过这杯。”说着，便自己干了。邢、王二夫人也忙干了，薛姨娘、李婶娘也只得于了。贾母又命宝玉道：“你连姐姐妹妹的一齐斟上，不许乱斟，都要叫他干了。”宝玉听说，答应着，一一按次斟上了。至黛玉前，偏他不饮，拿起杯来，放在宝玉唇边。宝玉一气饮干，黛玉笑说：“多谢。”宝玉替他斟上一杯。风姐儿便笑道：“宝玉别喝冷酒。仔细手颤，明儿写不的字、拉不的弓。”宝玉道：“没有吃冷酒。”凤姐儿笑道：“我知道没有，不过白嘱咐你。”然后宝玉将里面斟完，只除贾蓉之妻是命丫鬟们斟的。复出至廊下，又给贾珍等斟了。坐了一回，方进来，仍归旧坐。\n　　一时上汤之后，又接着献元宵。贾母便命：“将戏暂歇，小孩子们可怜见的，也给他们些滚汤热菜的吃了再唱。”又命将各样果子元宵等物拿些给他们吃。一时歇了戏，便有婆子带了两个门下常走的女先儿进来，放了两张杌子在那一边，贾母命他们坐了，将弦子琵琶递过去。贾母便问李、薛二人：“听什么书？”他二人都回说：“不拘什么都好。”贾母便问：“近来可又添些什么新书？”两个女先回说：“倒有一段新书，是残唐五代的故事。”贾母问是何名，女先儿回说：“这叫做《凤求鸾》。”贾母道：“这个名字倒好，不知因什么起的？你先说大概，若好再说。”女先儿道：“这书上乃是说残唐之时，那一位乡绅，本是金陵人氏，名唤王忠，曾做过两朝宰辅，如今告老还家，膝下只有一位公子，名唤王熙凤。”众人听了，笑将起来。贾母笑道：“这不重了我们凤丫头了？”媳妇忙上去推他说：“是二奶奶的名字，少混说。”贾母道：“你只管说罢。”女先儿忙笑着站起来说：“我们该死了！不知是奶奶的讳。”凤姐儿笑道：“怕什么，你说罢。重名重姓的多着呢。”女先儿又说道：“那年王老爷打发了王公子上京赶考，那日遇了大雨，到了一个庄子上避雨。谁知这庄上也有位乡绅，姓李，与王老爷是世交，便留下这公子住在书房里。这李乡绅膝下无儿，只有一位千金小姐。这小姐芳名叫做雏鸾，琴棋书画，无所不通。”贾母忙道：“怪道叫做《凤求鸾》。不用说了，我已经猜着了：自然是王熙凤要求这雏鸾小姐为妻了。”女先儿笑道：“老祖宗原来听过这回书？”众人都道：“老太太什么没听见过！就是没听见，也猜着了。”贾母笑道：“这些书就是一套子，左不过是些佳人才子，最没趣儿。把人家女儿说的这么坏，还说是‘佳人’！编的连影儿也没有了。开口都是乡绅门第，父亲不是尚书，就是宰相。一个小姐，必是爱如珍宝。这小姐必是通文知礼，无所不晓，竟是‘绝代佳人’，只见了一个清俊男人，不管是亲是友，想起他的终身大事来，父母也忘了，书也忘了，鬼不成鬼，贼不成贼，那一点儿象个佳人！就是满腹文章，做出这样事来，也算不得是佳人了。比如一个男人家，满腹的文章，去做贼，难道那王法看他是个才子就不入贼情一案了不成？可知那编书的是自己堵自己的嘴。再者，既说是世宦书香大家子的小姐，又知礼读书，连夫人都知书识礼的，就是告老还家，自然奶妈子丫头伏侍小姐的人也不少，怎么这些书上，凡有这样的事，就只小姐和紧跟的一个丫头知道？你们想想，那些人都是管做什么的？可是前言不答后语了不是？”\n　　众人听了，都笑说：“老太太这一说，是谎都批出来了。”贾母笑道：“有个原故：编这样书的人，有一等妒人家富贵的，或者有求不遂心，所以编出来遭塌人家。再有一等人，他自己看了这些书，看邪了，想着得一个佳人才好，所以编出来取乐儿。他何尝知道那世宦读书人家儿的道理！——别说那书上那些大家子，如今眼下拿着咱们这中等人家说起，也没那样的事。别叫他诌掉了下巴颏子罢。所以我们从不许说这些书，连丫头们也不懂这些话。这几年我老了，他们姐儿们住的远，我偶然闷了，说几句听听，他们一来，就忙着止住了。”李、薛二人都笑说：“这正是大家子的规矩。连我们家也没有这些杂话叫孩子们听见。”\n　　凤姐儿走上来斟酒，笑道：“罢，罢！酒冷了，老祖宗喝一口润润嗓子再掰谎罢。这一回就叫做《掰谎记》，就出在本朝，本地，本年，本月，本日，本时。老祖宗‘一张口难说两家话’，‘花开两朵，各表一枝’。‘是真是谎且不表，再整观灯看戏的人’。老祖宗且让这二位亲戚吃杯酒、看两出戏着，再从逐朝话言掰起，如何？”一面说，一面斟酒，一面笑。未说完，众人俱已笑倒了。两个女先儿也笑个不住，都说：“奶奶好刚口，奶奶要一说书，真连我们吃饭的地方都没了。”薛姨妈笑道：“你少兴头些，外头有人，比不得往常。\n”凤姐儿笑道：“外头只有一位珍大哥哥，我们还是论哥哥妹妹，从小儿一处淘气淘了这么大。这几年因做了亲，我如今立了多少规矩了！便不是从小儿兄妹，只论大伯子小婶儿，那二十四孝上‘斑衣戏彩’，他们不能来戏彩引老祖宗笑一笑，我这里好容易引的老祖宗笑一笑，多吃了一点东西，大家喜欢，都该谢我才是，难道反笑我不成？”贾母笑道：“可是这两日我竟没有痛痛的笑一场，倒是亏他才一路说，笑的我这里痛快了些。我再吃钟酒。”吃着酒，又命宝玉：“来敬你姐姐一杯。”凤姐儿笑道：“不用他敬，我讨老祖宗的寿罢。”说着便将贾母的杯拿起来，将半杯剩酒吃了，将杯递与丫鬟，另将温水浸的杯换一个上来。于是各席上的都撤去，另将温水浸着的代换，斟了新酒上来，然后归坐。\n　　女先儿回说：“老祖宗不听这书，或者弹一套曲子听听罢。”贾母道：“你们两个对一套《将军令》罢。”二人听说，忙合弦按调拨弄起来。贾母因问：“天有几更了？”众婆子忙回：“三更了。”贾母道：“怪道寒浸浸的起来。”早有众丫鬟拿了添换的衣裳送来。王夫人起身陪笑说道：“老太太不如挪进暖阁里地炕上，倒也罢了。这二位亲戚也不是外人，我们陪着就是了。”贾母听说，笑道：“既这样说，不如大家都挪进去，岂不暖和？”王夫人道：“恐里头坐不下。”贾母道：“我有道理：如今也不用这些桌子，只用两三张并起来，大家坐在一处挤着，又亲热又暖和。”众人都道：“这才有趣儿！”说着，便起了席。众媳妇忙撤去残席，里面直顺并了三张大桌，又添换了果馔摆好。贾母便说：“都别拘礼，听我分派你们就坐才好。”说着，便让薛、李正面上坐，自己西向坐了，叫宝琴、黛玉、湘云三人皆紧依左右坐下，向宝玉说：“你挨着你太太。”于是邢夫人、王夫人之中夹着宝玉。宝钗等姐妹在西边，挨次下去，便是娄氏带着贾蓝、尤氏李纨夹着贾兰，下面横头是贾蓉媳妇胡氏。贾母便说：“珍哥带着你兄弟们去罢，我也就睡了。”贾珍等忙答应，又都进来听吩咐。贾母道：“快去罢，不用进来，才坐好了，又都起来。你快歇着罢，明儿还有大事呢。”贾珍忙答应了，又笑道：“留下蓉儿斟酒才是。”贾母笑道：“正是忘了他。”贾珍应了一个“是”，便转身带领贾琏等出来。二人自是欢喜，便命人将贾琮、贾璜各自送回家去，便约了贾琏去追欢买笑，不在话下。\n　　这里贾母笑道：“我正想着，虽然这些人取乐，必得重孙一对双全的在席上才好。蓉儿这可全了。蓉儿，和你媳妇坐在一处，倒也团圆了。”因有家人媳妇呈上戏单，贾母笑道：“我们娘儿们正说得兴头，又要吵起来。况且那孩子们熬夜，怪冷的。罢，且叫他们歇歇，把咱们的女孩子们叫起来，就在这台上唱两出罢，也给他们瞧瞧。”媳妇子们听了，答应出来，忙的一面着人往大观园去传人，一面二门口去传小厮们伺候。小厮们忙至戏房，将班中所有大人一概带出，只留下小孩子们。\n　　一时，梨香院的教习带了文官等十二人从游廊角门出来，婆子们抱着几个软包，因不及抬箱，料着贾母爱听的三五出戏的彩衣包了来。婆子们带了文官等进去，见过，只垂手站着。贾母笑道：“大正月里，你师父也不放你们出来逛逛？你们如今唱什么？才刚八出《八义》，闹的我头疼，咱们清淡些好。你瞧瞧，薛姨太太，这李亲家太太，都是有戏的人家，不知听过多少好戏的；这些姑娘们都比咱们家的姑娘见过好戏，听过好曲子。如今这小戏子又是那有名玩戏的人家的班子，虽是小孩子，却比大班子还强。咱们好歹别落了褒贬。少不得弄个新样儿的，叫芳官唱一出《寻梦》，只用萧和笙笛，余者一概不用。”文官笑道：“老祖宗说的是。我们的戏，自然不能入姨太太和亲家太太、姑娘们的眼；不过听我们一个发脱口齿，再听个喉咙罢了。”贾母笑道：“正是这话了。”李婶娘、薛姨妈喜的笑道：“好个灵透孩子，你也跟着老太太打趣我们。”贾母笑道：“我们这原是随便的玩意儿，又不出去做买卖，所以竟不大合时。”说着，又叫葵官：“唱一出《惠明下书》，也不用抹脸。只用这两出，叫他们二位太太听个助意儿罢了。若省了一点儿力，我可不依。”文官等听了出来，忙去扮演上台，先是《寻梦》，次是《下书》。众人鸦雀无闻。薛姨妈笑道：“实在戏也看过几百班，从没见过只用萧管的。”贾母道：“先有，只是象方才《西楼》《楚江清》一只，多有小生吹萧合的。这合大套的实在少。这也在人讲究罢了，这算什么出奇。”又指着湘云道：“我象他这么大的时候儿，他爷爷有一班小戏，偏有一个弹琴的，凑了《西厢记》的《听琴》，《玉簪记》的《琴挑》，《续琵琶》的《胡笳十八拍》，竟成了真的了。比这个更如何？”众人都道：“那更难得了。”贾母于是叫过媳妇们来，吩咐文官等叫他们吹弹一套《灯月圆》。媳妇们领命而去。\n　　当下贾蓉夫妻二人捧酒一巡。凤姐儿因贾母十分高兴，便笑道：“趁着女先儿们在这里．不如咱们传梅，行一套‘春喜上眉梢’的令，如何？”贾母笑道：“这是个好令啊！正对时景儿。”忙命了人取了黑漆铜钉花腔令鼓来，给女先儿击着。席上取了一枝红梅，贾母笑道：“到了谁手里住了鼓，吃一杯，也要说些什么才好。”凤姐儿笑道：“依我说，谁象老祖宗要什么有什么呢？我们这不会的不没意思吗？怎么能雅俗共赏才好。不如谁住了，谁说个笑话儿罢。”众人听了，都知道他素日善说笑话儿，肚内有无限的新鲜趣令；今见如此说，不但在席的诸人喜欢，连地下伏侍的老小人等无不欢喜。那小丫头子们都忙去找姐姐叫妹妹的，告诉他们：“快来听，二奶奶又说笑话儿了。”众丫头子们便挤了一屋子。于是戏完乐罢，贾母将些汤细点果给文官等吃去，便命响鼓。那女先儿们都是惯熟的，或紧或慢，或如残漏之满，或如迸豆之急，或如惊马之驰，或如疾电之光而忽暗。其鼓声慢，传梅亦慢；鼓声疾，传梅亦疾。那梅方递至贾母手中，鼓声恰住，大家哈哈大笑。贾蓉忙上来斟了一杯，众人都笑道：“自然老太太先喜了，我们才托赖些喜。”贾母笑道：“这酒也罢了，只是这笑话儿倒有些难说。”众人都说：“老太太的比凤姑娘说的还好，赏一个，我们也笑一笑。”贾母笑道：“并没有新鲜招笑儿的，少不得老脸皮厚的说一个罢。”因说道：“一家子养了十个儿子，娶了十房媳妇儿。惟有第十房媳妇儿聪明伶俐、心巧嘴乖，公婆最疼，成日家说那九个不孝顺。这九个媳妇儿委屈，便商议说：‘咱们九个心里孝顺，只是不象那小蹄子儿嘴巧，所以公公婆婆只说他好。这委屈向谁诉去？’有主意的说道：‘咱们明儿到阎王庙去烧香，和阎王爷说去，问他一问，叫我们托生为人，怎么单单给那小蹄子儿一张乖嘴，我们都入了夯嘴里头？’那八个听了，都喜欢说：“这个主意不错。”第二日，便都往阎王庙里来烧香。九个都在供桌底下睡着了。九个魂专等阎王驾到。左等不来，右等也不到。正着急，只见孙行者驾着斤斗云来了，看见九个魂，便要拿金箍棒打来。吓得九个魂忙跪下央求。孙行者问起原故来，九个人忙细细的告诉了他。孙行者听了，把脚一跺，叹了一口气道：‘这原故幸亏遇见我，等着阎王来了，他也不得知道。’九个人听了，就求说：‘大圣发个慈悲，我们就好了。’孙行者笑道：‘却也不难：那日你们妯娌十个托生时，可巧我到阎王那里去，因为撒了一泡尿在地下，你那个小婶儿便吃了。你们如今要伶俐嘴乖，有的是尿，便撒泡你们吃就是了。’”\n　　说毕，大家都笑起来。凤姐儿笑道：“好的呀！幸而我们都是夯嘴夯腮的，不然，也就吃了猴儿尿了！”尤氏、娄氏都笑向李纨道：“咱们这里头谁是吃过猴儿尿的，别装没事人儿！”薛姨妈笑道：“笑话儿在对景就发笑。”\n　　说着，又击起鼓来。小丫头子们只要听凤姐儿的笑话，便悄悄的和女先儿说明，以咳嗽为记。须臾传至两遍，刚到了凤姐儿手里，小丫头子们故意咳嗽，女先儿便住了。众人齐笑道：“这可拿住他了！快吃了酒，说一个好的去，别太逗人笑的肠子疼！”\n　　凤姐儿想一想，笑道：“一家子也是过正月节，合家赏灯吃酒，真真的热闹非常。祖婆婆、太婆婆、媳妇、孙子媳妇、重孙子媳妇、亲孙子媳妇、侄孙子、重孙子、灰孙子、滴里搭拉的孙子、孙女儿、外孙女儿、姨表孙女、姑表孙女……嗳哟哟，真好热闹！”众人听他说着，已经笑了，都说：“听这数贫嘴的！又不知要编派那一个呢。”尤氏笑道：“你要招我，我可撕你的嘴！”凤姐儿起身拍手笑道：“人家这里费力，你们紧着混，我就不说了。”贾母笑道：“你说你的，底下怎么样？”凤姐儿想了一想，笑道：“底下就团团的坐了一屋子，吃了一夜酒，就散了。”\n　　众人见他正言厉色的说了，也都再无有别话，怔怔的还等往下说，只觉他冰冷无味的就住了。湘云看了他半日。凤姐儿笑道：“再说一个过正月节的：几个人拿着房子大的炮仗往城外放去，引了上万的人跟着瞧去。有一个性急的人等不得，就偷着拿香点着了。只见‘噗哧’的一声，众人哄然一笑，都散了。这抬炮仗的人抱怨卖炮仗的捍的不结实，没等放就散了。”湘云道：“难道本人没听见？”凤姐儿道：“本人原是个聋子。”众人听说，想了一回，不觉失声都大笑起来。又想着先前那个没完的，问他道：“先那一个到底怎么样？也该说完了。”凤姐儿将桌子一拍，道：“好罗唆！到了第二日是十六日，年也完了，节也完了，我看人忙着收东西还闹不清，那里还知道底下的事了？”众人听说，复又笑起。\n　　凤姐儿笑道：“外头已经四更多了，依我说：老祖宗也乏了，咱们也该‘聋子放炮仗——散了’罢？”尤氏等用绢子握着嘴，笑的前仰后合，指他说道：“这个东西真会数贫嘴！”贾母笑道：“真真这凤丫头，越发炼贫了！”一面说，一面吩咐道：“他提起炮仗来，咱们也把烟火放了，解解酒。”贾蓉听了，忙出去带着小厮们就在院子里安下屏架，将烟火设吊齐备。这烟火俱系各处进贡之物，虽不甚大，却极精致，各色故事俱全，夹着各色的花炮。黛玉禀气虚弱，不禁劈拍之声，贾母便搂他在怀内。薛姨妈便搂湘云，湘云笑道：“我不怕。”宝钗笑道：“他专爱自己放大炮仗，还怕这个呢！”王夫人便将宝玉搂入怀内。凤姐笑道：“我们是没人疼的！”尤氏笑道：“有我呢，我搂着你。你这会子又撒娇儿了，听见放炮仗，就象‘吃了蜜蜂儿屎’的，今儿又轻狂了。”凤姐儿笑道：“等散了，咱们园子里放去，我比小厮们还放的好呢。”说话之间，外面一色色的放了又放。又有许多“满天星”“九龙入云”“平地一声雷”“飞天十响”之类的零星小炮仗。放罢，然后又命小戏子打了一回“莲花落”，撒得满台的钱，那些孩子们满台的抢钱取乐。\n　　上汤时，贾母说：“夜长，不觉得有些饿了。”凤姐忙回说：“有预备的鸭子肉粥。”贾母道：“我吃些清淡的罢。”凤姐儿忙道：“也有枣儿熬的粳米粥，预备太太们吃斋的。”贾母道：“倒是这个还罢了。”说着，已经撤去残席，内外另设各种精致小菜。大家随意吃了些，用过漱口茶，方散。\n　　十七日一早，又过宁府行礼，伺候掩了祠门，收过影像，方回来。此日便是薛姨妈家请吃年酒。贾母连日觉得身上乏了，坐了半日，回来了。自十八日以后，亲友来请或来赴席的，贾母一概不会，有邢夫人、王夫人、凤姐三人料理。连宝玉只除王子腾家去了，余者亦皆不去，只说是贾母留下解闷。\n当下元宵已过，凤姐忽然小产了，合家惊慌。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Now Jia Zhen and Jia Lian had secretly ready large dust-pans of cash, and at the Lady Dowager’s order to distribute this they lost no time in telling pages to scatter it. The clink of coins on the stage so delighted her that the two men rose to their feet. Pages presented Jia Lian with a new silver ever, and he followed Jia Zhen inside.\n\nJia Zhen first went up to Aunt Li’s table and bowed as he took her cup, then turned round for Jia Lian to fill it. Next he went to Aunt Xue’s table and did the same.\n\nBoth ladies had risen to their feet. Smiling they protested, “Do be seated, gentlemen. There’s no call for such courtesy.”\n\nThen, apart from Lady Xing and Lady Wang, all the ladies at the feast rose to their feet and stood at attention. Jia Zhen and the others went to the couch on which the Lady Dowager was reclining. As it was low, the two men knelt there, Jia Zhen holding the cup and Jia Lian the ever. Although only these two were presenting wine, Jia Zong and the other young men had followed them in and now knelt down in a row too. Baoyu also hastily knelt, but Xiangyun nudged him and whispered:\n\n“If you kneel too, what are you going to do next? Why not go and offer a round of wine too?”\n\n“That can wait a bit,” he whispered back.\n\nAfter Jia Zhen and Jia Lian had offered wine and risen, they poured some for Lady Xing and Lady Wang too.\n\n“What about the young ladies?” Jia Zhen asked.\n\n“You may leave now,” said the Lady Dowager. “They can do as they please.”\n\nThen Jia Zhen and the others withdrew.\n\nBy this time the second watch had sounded and the eighth scene of the Lantern Festival was being performed — the most exciting part. Baoyu slipped out then and the Lady Dowager asked where he was going.\n\n“Don’t go far,” she warned. “There are fireworks outside, mind no lighted paper falls on you.”\n\n“I’m not going far,” he answered. “I’ll be right back.”\n\nShe ordered some nurses to keep an eye on him, and he went out attended only by Sheyue, Qiuwen and some young maids.\n\n“Why isn’t Xiren here?” the old lady asked. “She’s putting on airs now, sending these young girls instead.”\n\nLady Wang rose to explain, “Her mother died the other day. As she’s in mourning she didn’t think she should come.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded.\n\n“When you’re with your mistress, you can’t stick to the rules of mourning,” she remarked. “If she were still with me, she couldn’t stay away at a time like this. So that’s the rule now, is it?”\n\nXifeng hurried over to put in, “Even if she weren’t in mourning, with all those lanterns and fireworks in the Garden someone has to keep an eye on things there — it’s so risky. When there’s an opera here, everyone in the Garden sneaks in to have a look, but she’s so conscientious she keeps watch everywhere. Besides, after the party’s over and Baoyu goes back to bed, she has to see that everything’s ready for him. If she came, the others wouldn’t bother and when they went back they’d find his bedding cold and there’d be no tea ready — nothing as it should be. That’s why I told her not to come. If you want her, madam, I’ll send for her.”\n\n“You’re quite right,” said the Lady Dowager. “You’ve thought it out very well. Don’t send for her. When did her mother die? Why didn’t I know?”\n\n“It was the other day Xiren came to tell you herself,” Xifeng reminded her. “Have you forgotten?”\n\nThe old lady thought back, then said with a smile, “Yes, I remember now. My memory’s not as good as it was.”\n\n“How could you remember such things, madam?” the others asked.\n\nShe sighed, “I remember how she waited on me as a child, and later on Xiangyun for a few years; then she was given that little devil Baoyu and has been bewitched by him all these years. She wasn’t born a slave in our house, she’s had no great favours from us; yet now that her mother’s dead I meant to give her a few taels for the funeral, but it slipped my mind.”\n\n“The other day you gave her forty taels, madam,” said Xifeng.\n\n\"Forty taels of silver will do very well.\" The Lady Dowager nodded.\n\n\"That's all right then. It so happens that Yuanyang's mother died the other day, and as both her parents were in the south I didn't send her home to observe mourning. Now that both girls are in the same situation, why not let them keep each other company?\" She ordered some servants to take them fruit, dishes and sweetmeats. \"Why wait until now?\" chuckled Hupo. \"She's already gone.\"\n\nWith that, the party resumed their feasting and opera-watching.\n\nBaoyu went straight back to the Garden. The matrons, seeing that he was going to his own quarters, did not follow him but sat in the tea-kitchen by the Garden gate to warm themselves, snatching a chance to drink and gamble with the women in charge there. When Baoyu reached his compound, he found the place ablaze with light but silent.\n\n\"Can they all be asleep?\" asked Sheyue. \"Let's creep in and give them a fright.\"\n\nThey tiptoed in and peeped behind the mirror-screen. They saw Xiren lying on the couch opposite another girl, while two old nurses were dozing at the other end. Baoyu thought they were both asleep and was about to enter when he heard Yuanyang cough.\n\n\"Nothing in this world is certain,\" she said. \"You're here all by yourself with your parents away, and they're always travelling east or west with no fixed abode; so you'd think you'd never be able to attend to their funeral. Yet now your father's died here and you were able to go.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Xiren. \"I'd never expected to see my parents encoffined. Her Ladyship gave me forty taels of silver too. So I feel I've been repaid for all their care, and I mustn't ask for more.\"\n\nHearing this Baoyu turned and whispered to Sheyue, \"I'd no idea she was here. If I go in now she'll leave in a huff. Let's go back and leave them to have a good talk. Xiren's been so upset, it's good Yuanyang's come.\"\n\nHe tiptoed out again then and, walking round the rockery, stood there to raise his clothes. Sheyue and Qiuwen stood with their backs to him.\n\n\"Squat down to do that,\" they giggled. \"Mind you don't catch cold.\"\n\nThe two younger maids behind, realizing that he was urinating, hurried ahead to the tea-kitchen to fetch water.\n\nJust then two serving-women came towards him.\n\n\"Who's that?\" they asked.\n\n\"It's Baoyu,\" Qiuwen told them. \"Don't shout like that, you'll scare him.\"\n\n\"We didn't know,\" the women apologized quickly. \"We wouldn't have done anything to spoil the festival. You young ladies must be worn out after these last few days.\"\n\nBy now they had come closer.\n\n\"What have you got there?\" asked Sheyue.\n\n\"Her Old Ladyship sent these fruits and cakes for Miss Jin and Miss Hua.\"\n\nQiuwen giggled, \"The opera they're performing outside is Eight Righteousnesses, not The Chaos in Heaven, so how come you've produced a Golden Flower Goddess?\"\n\n\"Let me see what's in there,\" said Baoyu.\n\nSheyue and Qiuwen lifted the lids of the two hampers, and the serving-women squatted down to show him. When he saw that each hamper contained the best sweetmeats and delicacies from the feast, he nodded and moved on. Sheyue and the others hastily put back the lids and followed.\n\n\"Those two women are very civil and talk so pleasantly,\" Baoyu remarked. \"They're the ones who are tired out, yet they say you must be worn out. They're not like those who boast about their own services.\"\n\n\"Those two are all right,\" said Sheyue. \"The ones who don't know how to talk are too ignorant.\"\n\n\"You're intelligent, you should make allowances for the ignorant and uncouth,\" he replied.\n\nAs they were talking they left the Garden. The old nurses who had been drinking and gambling kept coming out to see if Baoyu was coming, and now they escorted him back. In the corridor by the hall they found the two younger maids, one of them holding a basin.\n\nHolding a towel and a little pot of scented lotion, a young maid had been waiting there for some time. Qiuwen dipped her hand quickly in the water.\n\n“The bigger you grow the more careless you get,” she scolded. “How can you bring cold water like this?”\n\n“Just feel it, miss,” said the maid. “On a day like this I was afraid the water would be cold, so I fetched boiling water; yet now it’s cool.”\n\nJust then an old woman came along with a kettle of boiling water.\n\n“Granny, come and pour some in for us,” cried the maid.\n\n“This is to make tea for the old lady, miss,” was the reply. “You’d better get some for yourself. It won’t kill you to walk that far.”\n\n“Who cares whose it is? If you won’t give me any, I’ll pour the water from Her Ladyship’s tea-kettle over my hands,” snapped Qiuwen.\n\nWhen the old woman saw who it was she hastily came over to pour some water for them.\n\n“That’s enough,” said Qiuwen. “At your age you should know better. Don’t you know that if it hadn’t been for Her Ladyship I’d never have asked? Don’t be such a fool.”\n\n“My eyes are so dim, I didn’t recognize you, miss,” was the apology.\n\nBaoyu having washed his hands, the little maid poured some of the scented lotion into his palms and he rubbed it on. Then Qiuwen and Sheyue warmed their hands too in the water before following him in.\n\nBaoyu now asked for a pot of warm wine and started to pour out for Aunt Li, who smilingly made him take a seat.\n\n“Let the young fellow pour,” said the Lady Dowager. “We must all drain our cups.”\n\nShe tossed off her own wine then, as did Lady Xing and Lady Wang, while Aunt Xue and Aunt Li felt constrained to follow suit.\n\n“Now fill your cousins’ cups too,” the old lady ordered Baoyu. “And you mustn’t fill them at random. I shall expect every one of them to empty her cup.”\n\nBaoyu assented and proceeded to pour out for each in turn. When he came to Daiyu, however, she simply raised the cup to his lips instead of drinking herself. He drained it at one gulp, at which she smiled and said, “Thank you.” Then he poured another cup for her.\n\n“Don’t drink cold wine, Baoyu,” warned Xifeng. “If you do, your hand will tremble too much later to write or draw your bow.”\n\n“I haven’t drunk any cold wine,” he protested.\n\n“I know, but I’m warning you.”\n\nWhen he had poured for all the girls, leaving only Jia Rong’s wife to be served by the maids, he went out to the verandah to serve Jia Zhen and the other men. After sitting with them for a while he returned to his former place.\n\nSoon soup was served, followed by sweet dumplings. The Lady Dowager ordered the actresses to rest.\n\n“Poor children,” she said, “they must be cold. Bring them some hot soup and some good hot food first.” She also sent them different kinds of sweetmeats and dumplings.\n\nDuring the interval two professional story-tellers, often employed by the house, were led in by an old serving-woman. The Lady Dowager had stools put for them and handed them a lute and a three-stringed guitar.\n\n“What stories do you good ladies know?” she asked Aunt Li and Aunt Xue. “Tell us which you’d like to hear.”\n\n“Anything you like,” they answered.\n\nSo the Lady Dowager asked the two performers, “What new stories have you lately?”\n\n“Yes, we have a new story about the Five Dynasties,” one of them replied.\n\n“What is it called?”\n\n“The Phoenix Seeks His Mate.”\n\n“That sounds a good title. Why do you say that? Tell us the outline first, and if it’s interesting you can give us the full details.”\n\n“This story is set in the time of the last ruler of the Tang Dynasty,” said the story-teller. “There was a nobleman, a native of Jinling, who had been a minister in two reigns but now, having retired, returned to his native place. His name was Wang Zhong and he had one son called Wang Xifeng.”\n\nAt this the whole family laughed.\n\n“Why, that’s the same as our Xifeng’s name,” exclaimed the Lady Dowager.\n\nLi Wan told the story-teller, “That’s our Second Mistress’ name. Mind what you say.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager said, “Go ahead.”\n\nThe story-teller rose to her feet with a smile. “We deserve to die for not knowing that this was the young lady’s name!”\n\n“Never mind,” said Xifeng. “Plenty of people have the same name. Go on.”\n\nSo the story-teller continued, “That day it started to rain and young Mr. Wang took shelter in a manor. The squire of this manor, a friend of his father’s named Li, had no son but only a daughter called Chuluan, a young lady well versed in all the womanly arts....”\n\n“No wonder the story’s called A Phoenix Seeks His Mate,” interposed the Lady Dowager. “No need to say more. I can guess. Of course Wang Xifeng wanted to marry this young lady.”\n\n“So you’ve heard this story before, madam?” asked the story-teller.\n\n“Of course our Old Ancestress has heard it,” the others cried. “Even if she hadn’t, she could guess.”\n\n“That’s the trouble with such stories,” said the Lady Dowager. “They’re all cut to the same pattern and just a recital of the love affairs of talented scholars and beauties — most insipid. The way they run down young ladies is scandalous, yet they call them ‘beauties’! They’re completely untrue to life. They start off by telling us the family’s a scholarly one of officials; the father’s a prime minister or a councillor, and the daughter’s a precious only child. And this young lady is such a paragon, so cultured and refined, the perfect ‘beauty.’ But as soon as she sets eyes on a handsome young man, whether a relative or a family friend, she starts thinking about her lifelong future and forgets her parents, forgetting her book-learning too. She’s no ghost or thief, is she? How can a ‘beauty’ behave so badly? If a girl who’s read a lot of books starts acting that way, she’s no ‘beauty’ at all. It’s like a man well versed in the classics becoming a thief. Do you suppose the court would let him off because he was a talented scholar? A story-teller like that can’t make his own tale convincing.\n\n“Besides, the daughter of a noble, cultured family is a well-bred girl who’s read the classics, and her mother is a lady who knows the rules of propriety too. Even after her husband retires, she has plenty of nurses and maids to wait on the young lady. So how is it that in all these stories, when such things happen, only the young lady and her personal maid know about it? What are all her other attendants doing? Isn’t this a case of the tongue contradicting the lips?”\n\nThe others laughed and said, “You’ve exposed all their lies, madam.”\n\n“There’s a reason for it,” she continued. “The people who invent these stories are either jealous because other families are rich and noble, or because they’ve been refused some request and so make up these tales to blacken people’s characters. Or else they’re the sort of feckless fools who, having read such stories and become slightly deranged, long to meet beauties themselves and so invent such wish-fulfilment tales. What do they know about the ways of official families?\n\n“Not to speak of those grand families described in the books, even in a household of our moderate means such things don’t happen. So they’d better stop talking such nonsense. That’s why we’ve never allowed such stories here, and the maids don’t know them either. Now that I’m old and the girls live in a different compound, if I feel bored and let them tell a few tales, as soon as the girls come I stop them.”\n\n“That’s the rule in a great household,” said Aunt Li and Aunt Xue. “Even in our homes the children don’t hear such silly talk.”\n\nXifeng came up at this point to fill their cups.\n\n“Enough, enough!” she cried gaily. “The wine is cold, Old Ancestress. Take a sip to moisten your throat before exposing more lies. This tale should be called An Exposure of Lies. It happened in our own dynasty, in our own locality, this year, this month, today, this very hour. Our Old Ancestress, with her ‘one mouth can’t tell of two\n\n‘Let’s have some family talk then,’ she said, ‘and “tell two stories at once.” But never mind whether it’s true or false, let’s get back to the people watching the lanterns and the plays. Why don’t you let these two relatives of yours drink a cup of wine and watch a couple of plays first, Grannie, and then we can go back to the beginning of the story and start taking it to pieces?’\n\nAs she spoke, she poured out some wine, laughing as she did so. Before she had finished, her audience was already in fits. The two women storytellers were laughing so much they could not stop.\n\n‘What a sharp tongue you have, madam!’ they said. ‘If you were to take up storytelling, we should be out of a job.’\n\nAunt Xue laughed.\n\n‘Don’t be so carried away! There are people outside, you know. This isn’t like one of our ordinary family gatherings.’\n\n‘Outside there’s only my elder brother Zhen,’ said Xi-feng. ‘We’ve always been like brothers and sisters. We used to romp around together when we were children. It’s only since we’ve both been married these last few years that I’ve had to be a bit more careful. But even if we weren’t like brother and sister, even if he’s the elder brother-in-law and I’m the younger sister-in-law, surely you remember that story in the Twenty-four Examples of Filial Piety about the old person who dressed up in baby clothes to amuse his parents? If Cousin Zhen can’t come in here and amuse you, Grannie, it’s up to me to do my best to make you laugh. If I succeed in making you laugh and you feel a little better and eat a little more as a result, then everyone ought to be pleased with me. What are you all laughing at me for?’\n\n‘You know, these last few days I haven’t had a single good laugh until now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It’s a good thing she’s been here to make me feel cheerful again. I think I’ll have another cup of wine.’\n\nShe took a drink and then turned to Bao-yu.\n\n‘Come, my child! I want you to drink a cup with your sister.’\n\n‘He doesn’t need to drink with me,’ said Xi-feng quickly. ‘Let me drink to Grannie’s long life instead.’\n\nShe picked up Grandmother Jia’s cup and drained what was left of the wine in it. Then she handed the cup to a maid, who replaced it with another one which had been standing in a bowl of warm water to take the chill off. The water-warmed cups on all the tables were now exchanged for fresh ones and the ladies’ wine-cups were filled. Then they resumed their places.\n\nThe two professional ladies now addressed Grandmother Jia once more:\n\n‘If you aren’t in the mood for a story, madam, perhaps you would care to hear an air or two upon the zither?’\n\n‘Why don’t the two of you play a duet for us?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Let’s have “The General’s Command”.’\n\nThe two women tuned their instruments and began to play.\n\n‘What watch of the night is it?’ Grandmother Jia asked the servants.\n\n‘The third watch, madam,’ they told her.\n\n‘No wonder I’m beginning to feel the cold,’ said Grandmother Jia.\n\nThe maids had already anticipated her need and came forward with warm outdoor clothing for her. Lady Wang rose to her feet and said smilingly:\n\n‘Why don’t you move inside, Mother, and sit on the heated kang in the inner room? It would be more comfortable for you. These two relatives are not outside rs. We can keep them company for you.’\n\n‘In that case, why don’t we all move inside?’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘It would be warmer for everybody.’\n\n‘I’m afraid there won’t be room for all of us,’ said Lady Wang.\n\n‘Then we’ll have to manage as best we can,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘We can push a few of these tables together, so that we can all sit round them. It will be cosier as well as warmer that way.’\n\nEveryone thought this a delightful idea. They got up from their seats at once. The servants hurried to clear the tables and inside the room three of the large tables were placed together in a row and reloaded with sweetmeats and other refreshments.\n\n‘Now I don’t want any arguments,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I shall tell you where to sit and you will do as I say.’\n\nShe made Aunt Xue and Aunt Li take the places of honour, and seated herself in the west-facing seat at the side. She told Bao-qin, Dai-yu and Xiang-yun to sit next to her, one on either side and one opposite.\n\n‘Bao-yu, you sit next to your mother,’ she said.\n\nSo Bao-yu sat between Lady Xing and Lady Wang. On the other side, at the west end of the table, sat Bao-chai and the three Jia girls, and below them, in the remaining places, were You-shi and Li Wan, with little Jia Lan between them, and at the very bottom Mrs Jia Rong.\n\n‘Zhen and the other men had better go to bed now,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘I shall be going to bed myself very shortly.’\n\nJia Zhen and the other men acknowledged her command, but instead of retiring, they came into the room to hear if she had any further instructions.\n\n‘Off you go!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘There’s no need for you to stay. I’m not going to give you any more instructions. We’ve only just sat down. I don’t want to have to get up again. Go to bed now, all of you. I want you to be up early tomorrow for the important business we have in hand.’\n\nJia Zhen assented and would have withdrawn, but Grandmother Jia forbade him.\n\nAfter a pause she added, “Why not keep Rong to serve the wine?”\n\n“Yes, I’d forgotten him,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\nChia Chen assented and turned to lead Chia Lien and the others out. They were naturally delighted to be let off so lightly and sent Chia Tsung and Chia Huang home, after which they went off to amuse themselves. But no more of this.\n\n“I was thinking that although we’re having a good time,” remarked the Lady Dowager then, “we should have a great-grandson and his wife at the feast too to make it complete. And now Rong is here. Come, Rong, sit with your wife so that we have a family reunion.”\n\nAs she spoke, a servant’s wife presented the opera-list.\n\n“We mothers and children are enjoying a chat,” said the old lady. “I’m afraid an opera would disturb us. Besides, those child-actors must be cold, staying up so late. Better tell them to rest. We can have some of our own girls perform a couple of items on this stage to entertain the guests.”\n\nThe woman assented and went out to send servants to the Garden to fetch the actresses and others to wait at the inner gate. The pages hurried to the greenroom and escorted all the adult players away, leaving only the children.\n\nSoon the instructresses from Pear Fragrance Court came through the side gate in the covered corridor with the twelve young actresses. Some old women followed with bundles, for there had been no time to fetch the chests and they had simply wrapped up in cloth bundles the costumes needed for the few operas the Lady Dowager was fond of. The old women took Wen-kuan and the other actresses in to pay their respects, after which they stood at attention with their arms at their sides.\n\n“Why didn’t your mistress let you out during the New Year to enjoy yourselves?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“What are you going to perform for us? That Eight Courtiers just now made my head ache. We want something quiet. You see, Mrs. Hsueh and Mrs. Li here both come from families with players of their own, who must have put on any number of good operas for them; and these young ladies have seen better operas and heard better singing than the girls in our household. Though these child-actresses are from a company belonging to people known for their fine performances, and though children are better than adults, we must do our best not to provoke criticism. So you’ll have to do something unusual. Let Fang-kuan sing The Dream, with no other accompaniment except flutes and pipes.”\n\n“Quite right, Old Ancestress,” said Wen-kuan. “Our acting couldn’t please these ladies and young ladies — it will be very crude. They’ll just have to put up with our singing and recitation.”\n\n“That’s the idea,” agreed the Lady Dowager.\n\n“What a clever child!” cried Aunt Li and Aunt Hsueh. “Trying to make fun of us the way our Old Ancestress does.”\n\n“This is just an informal diversion, not a professional performance,” said the Lady Dowager. “So we don’t have to stick to the conventions.” She told Kuei-kuan, “You act Huiming Delivers a Letter, and you needn’t make up. Just these two items to entertain our two guests. If you don’t do your best, I shan’t be pleased.”\n\nWen-kuan and the others withdrew to prepare, then mounted the stage. First came The Dream, then Huiming Delivers a Letter. The audience listened in rapt silence.\n\n“I must have seen several hundred performances,” remarked Aunt Hsueh, “but never one with only a flute for accompaniment.”\n\n“Yes, there are some,” said the Lady Dowager. “For instance, in that scene just now from The Western Chamber when the young scholar plays the flute to the verse ‘The river is clear’ in the mode Chuchiangyi. But it’s rare to have flute accompaniment for a whole opera. It depends on the producer — there’s nothing so wonderful about it.”\n\nPointing to Hsiang-yun she went on, “When I was her age, my grandfather had a company of child-actresses. One of them could play the lute, and they performed The Lute Playing from The Western Chamber, The Lute melody from The Jade Hairpin and the Eighteen Cadenzas from The Lute Song. It sounded just like the real thing, and was even better than this.” The others agreed.\n\n\"That’s even better,” said the Lady Dowager, and she ordered her daughters-in-law to tell Wen Guan and the other actresses to play The Moon and the Lanterns. The women assented and withdrew.\n\nJia Rong and his wife now came round to offer wine to all in turn.\n\nXifeng was in high spirits because the Lady Dowager was so merry.\n\n“As the story-tellers are here, why don’t we pass round a spray of plum-blossom to the accompaniment of the drum?” she suggested. “We can play the game ‘Spring Joy Mounts the Eyebrows.’ What do you say?”\n\n“A good idea,” cried the Lady Dowager. “It’s just the game for this festival.” She ordered a drum with a lacquered copper face to be fetched for the story-tellers to beat.\n\nWhen a branch of red plum had been picked and brought to the feast, the Lady Dowager proposed with a smile, “Whoever has the spray when the drum stops must drink and also say something.”\n\n“My idea is this,” said Xifeng. “Who can compare with our Old Ancestress, who has everything at her fingertips? It would be dull for those of us who are so slow-witted. To please all, high and low, why not make whoever is caught tell a joke?”\n\nThe others, knowing her reputation as a wit with an endless fund of jokes, were delighted with this proposal — not only the guests at the table but all the servants young and old waiting on them. The young maids ran to fetch their friends, urging, “Come quickly! Madam Lian’s going to tell jokes.” In no time the room was packed.\n\nAfter the actors had withdrawn and the Lady Dowager had sent them some soup, pastries and fruit, the drum started up. The story-tellers, who were used to this, beat it fast or slow as if they were sounding a watchman’s clapper, or like peas spattering down, a panicked horse galloping off, or lightning zigzagging across the sky. When the drum slowed down the plum-blossom was passed round slowly; when it quickened they passed it fast. Just as it reached the Lady Dowager the drumming suddenly stopped. Everybody laughed.\n\nJia Rong promptly stepped forward to fill her cup.\n\n“Of course our Old Ancestress is the first to be caught,” they cried. “That should bring us all luck.”\n\n“This wine is all right,” said the Lady Dowager, “but it won’t be so easy to tell a joke.”\n\n“If you tell a better one than Xifeng and reward us, we shall laugh even more,” they replied.\n\n“I’ve no new jokes that are really funny,” she said. “I’ll just have to make an exhibition of my old age.”\n\nShe began, “A certain family had ten sons who married ten daughters-in-law. The tenth daughter-in-law was so clever and had such a glib tongue that her parents-in-law doted on her and were forever complaining that the other nine were undutiful. This upset the nine sisters-in-law, who held a consultation.\n\n“‘We’re dutiful enough at heart,’ they said, ‘but we’re not glib like that hussy, so our parents-in-law think her good. Who can we complain to?’\n\n“One, who had a good head on her shoulders, suggested, ‘Let’s go to the Temple of the King of Hell tomorrow to burn incense and ask him why, when we were reborn as human beings, we were given such clumsy tongues while that hussy got such a glib one.’\n\n“The other eight were pleased with this proposal, and the next day they went to the Temple of the King of Hell to burn incense. After making their request, the nine of them lay down under the offering-table to wait. They waited and waited, but the King of Hell failed to appear. Just as they were growing anxious, however, the Monkey King Sun Wukong came riding through the clouds. Seeing nine mortal souls there, he raised his gold-banded cudgel to beat them, but they were so frightened that they fell on their knees to beg for mercy.\n\n“When Sun Wukong asked what they were doing there, they told him the whole story.\n\n“At that he stamped his foot and sighed. ‘What a pity you met me,’ he said. ‘If the King of Hell came, he wouldn’t be able to tell you the answer either.’\n\n“The nine women entreated him, ‘Great Sage, do us this kindness!’\n\n“Sun Wukong chuckled. ‘There’s no difficulty about it,’ he said. ‘The day you ten sisters-in-law were reborn, I happened to be calling on the King of Hell and happened to see your father-in-law kowtow to him, offering him ten slices of melon. So the King of Hell ordered ten animals to be your tongues.\n\n“‘The first nine were the tongues of apes, macaques and baboons; so you’re rather slow of speech. The tenth was the tongue of a parrot — that’s why your sister-in-law’s so glib.’”\n\n\"It just happened that I went to the King of Hell’s place and because I pissed on the ground, your young aunt lapped it up. If you want to be quick-witted and smooth-tongued, there’s plenty of piss here; I can piss and you can lap it up.”\n\nAt that the whole party burst out laughing.\n\n“Well done!” cried Xifeng. “Luckily we’re all slow and stupid, or we’d have lapped up monkey’s piss too.”\n\nMadam You and Lou laughed and said to Li Wan, “Who’s the one here who lapped up monkey’s piss? Don’t pretend to be so innocent!”\n\nAunt Xue chuckled, “A joke’s only funny if it fits.”\n\nThe drum started beating again. The maids, eager to hear Xifeng tell another joke, had a quiet word with the blind woman and arranged that they would cough as a signal. After the drum had gone round twice, when the sprig of plum-blossom reached Xifeng, the maids coughed deliberately and the blind woman stopped beating the drum.\n\n“We’ve caught her!” cried all the others gleefully. “Drink up quickly and tell us a good joke, but not one that’ll make us split our sides.”\n\nXifeng thought for a little.\n\n“There was a family celebrating the Moon Festival,” she began, “all enjoying the lanterns and drinking together. It was a really lively party with the grandmother, great-grandmother, daughters-in-law, grand-daughters-in-law, great-grand-daughters-in-law, grand-sons, great-grand-sons, great-great-grand-sons, and all the in-laws and their children, grand-daughters and grand-nieces on the paternal and maternal sides.... Dear me, what a rumpus!”\n\nThey were laughing already.\n\n“Just listen to her clack!” they cried. “We wonder who she’s getting at.”\n\n“If you make fun of me I’ll pinch your lips,” threatened Madam You.\n\nXifeng stood up and clapped her hands.\n\n“Here am I taking all this trouble to entertain you, but you keep butting in,” she protested. “Well then, I won’t go on.”\n\n“Tell us what happened next,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\nXifeng thought for a second.\n\n“Well then, the whole family sat round together drinking all night, and then they broke up.”\n\nThey had been listening to her deadpan account rather blankly, waiting for the rest, and were disappointed by this tame ending. Xiangyun stared at her in puzzlement.\n\nXifeng laughed.\n\n“Here’s another joke about the Moon Festival. A few men carried a fire-cracker as big as a house outside the city to set it off, and it attracted a crowd of ten thousand people. One impatient fellow couldn’t wait, so he stole up and lit the fuse. Then — phutt! — they all laughed and scattered. The men carrying the fire-cracker complained that the makers had done a bad job of pasting it — it had scattered before being set off.”\n\n“Didn’t the man who lit it hear it?” asked Xiangyun.\n\n“He was deaf,” replied Xifeng.\n\nThe others thought this over for a moment, then burst out laughing.\n\n“What about the first joke?” they asked. “Do finish it.”\n\nXifeng brought her hand down on the table.\n\n“What a fuss!” she cried. “The next day was the sixteenth, the end of the New Year. Seeing how busy everyone was clearing things away, how should I know what happened after that?”\n\nThey laughed again.\n\n“It’s after the fourth watch outside,” Xifeng continued. “In my opinion, our Old Ancestress must be tired. Hadn’t we better do like the deaf man’s fire-cracker and disperse?”\n\nMadam You and the rest, clutching handkerchiefs to their mouths, doubled up with laughter.\n\n“What a tongue she has!” they spluttered.\n\n“This Feng girl is really too sharp!” chuckled the Lady Dowager.\n\nShe added, “As she’s mentioned fire-crackers, let’s set off some fireworks to sober ourselves up.”\n\nAt once Jia Rong went out with some pages to set them up in the court.\n\nThe fireworks, all of which had been presented as tribute from different places, were now taken down from their racks and hung up ready to be set off. They were not very large but most ingeniously constructed, with designs representing all sorts of scenes and interspersed with coloured firecrackers. Dai-yu, with her weak nerves, could not stand explosions, so the Lady Dowager took her in her arms. Aunt Xue put her arms around Xiang-yun.\n\n“I’m not afraid,” said Xiang-yun.\n\n“If she likes setting off crackers herself, she’s not likely to be frightened of these,” Baochai teased.\n\nLady Wang then drew Baoyu to her to hug him.\n\n“We have no one to pet us,” complained Xifeng.\n\n“Don’t worry, I’ll hug you,” offered Madam You. “You’re just being spoilt. You’re like the monkey that ate arsenic — fidgeting like mad today.”\n\nXifeng retorted, “Wait till we break up, and we’ll set some off in the garden. I can beat the boys at that.”\n\nEven as they spoke, one type of firework after another was being set off outside. There were also innumerable small fireworks such as “Heaven-Filling Stars,” “Nine Dragons Soaring to the Clouds,” “A Thunderclap from a Clear Sky” and “Ten Shots Soaring Sky-High.” After this, some child-actors performed a Lottery game, scattering coins all over the stage which the children scrambled for.\n\nWhen soup was served the Lady Dowager remarked, “The night’s long and I feel rather hungry.”\n\n“There’s some duck congee ready,” Xifeng told her.\n\n“I’d rather have something light.”\n\n“There’s also some rice congee with dates for those who are fasting.”\n\n“That will do,” said the old lady.\n\nBy now the remains of the feast had been cleared away and more dainty dishes were served inside and out. They all ate a little of whatever they fancied, then rinsed their mouths with tea and dispersed.\n\nThe next morning they went early to the Ning Mansion to sacrifice, after which the shrine was closed and the portraits put away. Then they returned home. That day Aunt Xue was invited by her own family to a New Year feast, but the Lady Dowager who was tired after the last few days’ excitement came back after sitting there for a while. From the eighteenth onwards she declined all invitations, whether to feasts or operas, on the pretext of fatigue, leaving Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xifeng to cope with the relatives who called or invited them out. Even Baoyu did not go anywhere except to his uncle Wang Ziteng’s, saying that his grandmother wanted him at home to amuse her.\n\nSoon the Lantern Festival was over. And then Xifeng had a miscarriage.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
