  "original": "却说薛姨妈一时因被金桂这场气怄得肝气上逆，左胁作痛。宝钗明知是这个原故，也等不及医生来看，先叫人去买了几钱钩藤来，浓浓的煎了一碗，给他母亲吃了。又和秋菱给薛姨妈捶腿揉胸。停了一会儿，略觉安顿些。薛姨妈只是又悲又气。气的是金桂撤泼，悲的是宝钗有涵养，倒觉可怜。宝钗又劝了一回，不知不觉的睡了一觉，肝气也渐渐平复了。宝钗便说道：“妈妈，你这种闲气不要放在心上才好。这几天走的动了，乐得往那边老太太姨妈处去说说话儿，散散闷也好。家里横竖有我和秋菱照看着，谅他也不敢怎么着。”薛姨妈点点头道：“过两日看罢了。”\n　　且说元妃疾愈之后，家中俱各喜欢。过了几日，有几个老公走来，带着东西银两，宣贵妃娘娘之命，因家中省问勤劳，俱有赏赐，把物件银两一一交代清楚。贾赦、贾政等禀明了贾母，一齐谢恩毕，太监吃了茶去了。大家回到贾母房中，说笑一回，外面老婆子传进来说：“小厮们来回道：‘那边有人请大老爷说要紧的话呢。’”贾母便向贾赦道：“你去罢。”贾赦答应着，退出来自去了。\n　　这里贾母忽然想起，合贾政笑道：“娘娘心里却甚实惦记着宝玉，前儿还特特的问他来着呢。”贾政陪笑道：“只是宝玉不大肯念书，辜负了娘娘的美意。”贾母道：“我倒给他上了个好儿，说他近日文章都做上来了。”贾政笑道：“那里能象老太太的话呢。”贾母道：“你们时常叫他出去作诗作文，难道他都没作上来么？小孩子家，慢慢的教导他。可是人家说的：‘胖子也不是一口儿吃的。’”贾政听了这话，忙陪笑道：“老太太说的是。”贾母又道：“提起宝玉，我还有一件事和你商量：如今他也大了，你们也该留神，看一个好孩子，给他定下。这也是他终身的大事。也别论远近亲戚，什么穷啊富的，只要深知那姑娘的脾性儿好、模样儿周正的，就好。”贾政道：“老太太吩咐的很是。但只一件，姑娘也要好，第一要他自己学好才好。不然，不稂不莠的，反倒耽误了人家的女孩儿，岂不可惜？”贾母听了这话，心里却有些不喜欢，便说道：“论起来，现放着你们作父母的，那里用我去操心？但只我想宝玉这孩子从小儿跟着我，未免多疼他一点儿，耽误了他成人的正事，也是有的：只是我看他那生来的模样儿也还齐整，心性儿也还实在，未必一定是那种没出息的，必至遭塌了人家的女孩儿。也不知是我偏心？我看着横竖比环儿略好些。不知你们看着怎么样？”\n　　几句话说得贾政心中甚实不安，连忙陪笑道：“老太太看的人也多了，既说他好，有造化，想来是不错的。只是儿子望他成人的性儿太急了一点，或者竟合古人的话相反，倒是‘莫知其子之美’了。”一句话把贾母也怄笑了，众人也都陪着笑了。贾母因说道：“你这会子也有了几岁年纪，又居着官，自然越历练越老成。”说到这里，回头瞅着邢夫人合王夫人，笑道：“想他那年轻的时候，那一种古怪脾气，比宝玉还加一倍呢。直等娶了媳妇，才略略的懂了些人事儿。如今只抱怨宝玉。这会子，我看宝玉比他还略体些人情儿呢。”说的邢夫人王夫人都笑了，因说道：“老太太又说起逗笑儿的话儿来了。”说着，小丫头子们进来告诉鸳鸯：“请示老太太，晚饭伺候下了。”贾母便问：“你们又咕咕唧唧的说什么？”鸳鸯笑着回明了。贾母道：“那么着，你们也都吃饭去罢，单留凤姐儿珍哥媳妇跟着我吃罢。”贾政及邢王二夫人都答应着，伺候摆上饭来，贾母又催了一遍，才都退出各散。\n　　却说邢夫人自去了。贾政同王夫人进入房中。贾政因提起贾母方才的话来，说道：“老太太这么疼宝玉。毕竟要他有些实学，日后可以混得功名才好，不枉老太太疼他一场，也不至遭塌了人家的女儿。”王夫人道：“老爷这话自然是该当的。”贾政因派个屋里的丫头传出去告诉李贵：“宝玉放学回来，索性吃饭后再叫他过来，说我还要问他话呢。”李贵答应了“是”。至宝玉放了学，刚要过来请安，只见李贵道：“二爷先不用过去。老爷吩咐了，今日叫二爷吃了饭就过去呢。听见还有话问二爷呢。”宝玉听了这话，又是一个闷雷，只得见过贾母，便回园吃饭。三口两口吃完，忙漱了口，便往贾政这边来。贾政此时在内书房坐着。宝玉进来请了安，一旁侍立。贾政问道：“这几日我心上有事，也忘了问你。那一日你说你师父叫你讲一个月的书，就要给你开笔。如今算来将两个月了，你到底开了笔了没有？”宝玉道：“才做过三次。师父说：‘且不必回老爷知道；等好些，再回老爷知道罢。’因此，这两天总没敢回。”贾政道：“是什么题目？”宝玉道：“一个是‘吾十有五而志于学’，一个是‘人不知而不愠，’一个是‘则归墨’三字。”贾政道：“都有稿儿么？”宝玉道：“都是作了抄出来，师父又改的。”贾政道：“你带了家来了，还是在学房里呢？”宝玉道：“在学房里呢。”贾政道：“叫人取了来我瞧。”宝玉连忙叫人传话与焙茗，叫他：“往学房中去，我书桌子抽屉里有一本薄薄儿竹纸本子，上面写着‘窗课’两字的就是，快拿来。”\n　　一会儿，焙茗拿了来，递给宝玉，宝玉呈与贾政。贾政翻开看时，见头一篇写着题目是“吾十有五而志于学”。他原本破的是“圣人有志于学，幼而已然矣”。代儒却将“幼”字抹去，明用“十五”。贾政道：“你原本‘幼’字，便扣不清题目了。幼字是从小起，至十六以前都是‘幼’。这章书是圣人自言学问工夫与年俱进的话，所以十五、三十、四十、五十、六十、七十、俱要明点出来，才见得到了几时有这么个光景，到了几时又有那么个光景。师父把你幼字改了十五，便明白了好些。”看到承题，那抹去的原本云：“夫不志于学，人之常也。”贾政摇头道：“不但是孩子气，可见你本性不是个学者的志气。”又看后句：“圣人十五而志之，不亦难乎？”说道：“这更不成话了！”然后看代儒的改本云：“夫人孰不学？而志于学者卒鲜。此圣人所为自信于十五时欤？”便问：“改的懂得么？”宝玉答应道：“懂得。”\n　　又看第二艺，题目是“人不知而不愠”。便先看代儒的改本云：“不以不知而愠者，终无改其说乐矣。”方觑着眼看那抹去的底本，说道：“你是什么？‘能无愠人之心，纯乎学者也。’上一句似单做了‘而不愠’三个字的题目，下一句又犯了下文君子的分界；必如改笔，才合题位呢。且下句找清上文，方是书理。须要细心领略。”宝玉答应着。贾政又往下看：“夫不知，未有不愠者也；而竟不然。是非由说而乐者，曷克臻此？”原本末句“非纯学者乎”。贾政道：“这也与破题同病的。这改的也罢了，不过清苦，还说得去。”\n　　第三艺是“则归墨”。贾政看了题目，自己扬着头想了一想，因问宝玉道：“你的书讲到这里了么？”宝玉道：“师父说，《孟子》好懂些，所以倒先讲《孟子》，大前日才讲完了。如今讲上《论语》呢。”贾政因看这个破承，倒没大改。破题云：“言于舍杨之外，若别无所归者焉。”贾政道：“第二句倒难为你。”“夫墨，非欲归者也，而墨之言已半天下矣，则舍杨之外，欲不归于墨，得乎？”贾政道：“这是你做的么？”宝玉答应道：“是。”贾政点点头儿，因说道：“这也并没有什么出色处，但初试笔能如此，还算不离。前年我在任上时，还出过‘惟士为能’这个题目。那些童生都读过前人这篇，不能自出心裁，每多抄袭。你念过没有？”宝玉道：“也念过。”贾政道：“我要你另换个主意，不许雷同了前人，只做个破题也使得。”宝玉只得答应着，低头搜索枯肠。\n　　贾政背着手，也在门口站着作想。只见一个小小厮往外飞走，看见贾政，连忙侧身垂手站住。贾政便问道：“作什么？”小厮回道；“老太太那边姨太太来了，二奶奶传出话来，叫预备饭呢。”贾政听了，也没言语，那小厮自去了。谁知宝玉自从宝钗搬回家去，十分想念，听见薛姨妈来了，只当宝钗同来，心中早已忙了，便乍着胆子回道：“破题倒作了一个，但不知是不是？”贾政道：“你念来我听。”宝玉念道：“天下不皆士也，能无产者亦仅矣。”贾政听了，点着头道：“也还使得。以后作文，总要把界限分清，把神理想明白了再去动笔。你来的时候，老太太知道不知道？”宝玉道：“知道的。”贾政道：“既如此，你还到老太太处去罢。”\n　　宝玉答应了个“是”，只得拿捏着慢慢的退出。刚过穿廊月洞门影屏，便一溜烟跑到贾母院门口。急得焙茗在后头赶着叫道：“看跌倒了！老爷来了。”宝玉那里听的见？刚进得门来，便听见王夫人、凤姐、探春等笑语之声。丫鬟们见宝玉来了，连忙打起帘子，悄悄告诉道：“姨太太在这里呢。”宝玉赶忙进来给薛姨妈请安，过来才给贾母请了晚安。贾母便问：“你今儿怎么这早晚才散学？”宝玉悉把贾政看文章并命作破题的话述了一遍。贾母笑容满面。宝玉因问众人道：“宝姐姐在那里坐着呢？”薛姨妈笑道：“你宝姐姐没过来，家里和香菱作活呢。”宝玉听了，心中索然，又不好就走。只见说着话儿已摆上饭来，自然是贾母薛姨妈上坐，探春陪坐。薛姨妈道：“宝哥儿呢？”贾母笑着说道：“宝玉跟着我这边坐罢。”宝玉连忙回道：“头里散学时，李贵传老爷的话，叫吃了饭过去，我赶着要了一碟菜，泡茶吃了一碗饭，就过去了。老太太和姨妈、姐姐们用罢。”贾母道：“既这么着，凤丫头就过来跟着我。你太太才说他今儿吃斋，叫他们自己吃去罢。”王夫人也道：“你跟着老太太姨太太吃罢，不用等我，我吃斋呢。”于是凤姐告了坐，丫头安了杯箸。凤姐执壶斟了一巡才归坐。\n　　大家吃着酒，贾母便问道：“可是才姨太太提香菱，我听见前儿丫头们说‘秋菱’，不知是谁，问起来才知道是他。怎么那孩子好好的又改了名字呢？”薛姨妈满脸飞红，叹了口气，道：“老太太再别提起。自从蟠儿娶了这个不知好歹的媳妇，成日家咕咕唧唧，如今闹的也不成个人家了。我也说过他几次，他牛心不听说，我也没那么大精神和他们尽着吵去，只好由他们去。可不是他嫌这丫头的名儿不好改的。”贾母道：“名儿什么要紧的事呢。”薛姨妈道：“说起来，我也怪臊的。其实老太太这边，有什么不知道的？他那里是为这名儿不好？听见说，他因为是宝丫头起的，他才有心要改。”贾母道：“这又是什么原故呢？”薛姨妈把手绢子不住的擦眼泪，未曾说，又叹了一口气，道：“老太太还不知道呢，这如今媳妇子专和宝丫头怄气。前日老太太打发人看我去，我们家里正闹呢。”贾母连忙接着问道：“可是前儿听见姨太太肝气疼，要打发人看去；后来听见说好了，所以没着人去。依我劝，姨太太竟把他别放在心上。再者他们也是新过门的小夫妻，过些时自然就好了。我看宝丫头性格儿温厚和平，虽然年轻，比大人还强几倍。前日那小丫头子回来说，我们这边，还都赞叹了他一会子。都象宝丫头那样心胸儿、脾气儿，真是百里挑一的！不是我说句冒失话，那给人家作了媳妇儿，怎么叫公婆不疼，家里上上下下的不宾服呢？”宝玉头里已经听烦了，推故要走，及听见这话，又坐下呆呆的往下听。薛姨妈道：“不中用。他虽好，到底是女孩儿家。养了蟠儿这个糊涂孩子，真真叫我不放心。只怕在外头喝点子酒，闹出事来。幸亏老太太这里的大爷二爷常和他在一块儿，我还放点儿心。”宝玉听到这里，便接口道：“姨妈更不用悬心。薛大哥相好的都是些正经买卖大客人，都是有体面的，那里就闹出事来？”薛姨妈笑道：“依你这样说，我敢只不用操心了。”说话间，饭已吃完。宝玉先告辞了：“晚间还要看书。”便各自去了。\n　　这里丫头们刚捧上茶来，只见琥珀走过来向贾母耳朵旁边说了几句，贾母便向凤姐儿道：“你快去罢，瞧瞧巧姐儿去罢。”凤姐听了，还不知何故。大家也怔了。琥珀遂过来向凤姐道：“刚才平儿打发小丫头子来回二奶奶，说：‘巧姐儿身上不大好，请二奶奶忙着些过来才好呢。’”贾母因说道：“你快去罢，姨太太也不是外人。”凤姐连忙答应，在薛姨妈跟前告了辞。又见王夫人说道：“你先过去，我就去。小孩子家魂儿还不全呢，别叫丫头们大惊小怪的。屋里的猫儿狗儿，也叫他们留点神儿。尽着孩子贵气，偏有这些琐碎。”凤姐答应了，然后带了小丫头回房去了。这时薛姨妈又问了一回黛玉的病。贾母道：“林丫头那孩子倒罢了，只是心重些，所以身子就不大很结实了。要赌灵怪儿，也和宝丫头不差什么；要赌宽厚待人里头，却不济他宝姐姐有耽待、有尽让了。”薛姨妈又说了两句闲话儿，便道：“老太太歇着罢，我也要到家里去看看，只剩下宝丫头和香菱了。打那么同着姨太太看看巧姐儿。”贾母道：“正是。姨太太上年纪的人，看看是怎么不好，说给他们，也得点主意儿。”薛姨妈便告辞，同着王夫人出来，往凤姐院里去了。\n　　却说贾政试了宝玉一番，心里却也喜欢，走向外面和那些门客闲谈，说起方才的话来。便有新近到来最善大棋的一个王尔调名作梅的，说道：“据我们看来，宝二爷的学问已是大进了。”贾政道：“那有进益？不过略懂得些罢咧，‘学问’两个字早得很呢。”詹光道：“这是老世翁过谦的话。不但王大兄这般说，就是我们看，宝二爷必定要高发的。”贾政笑道：“这也是诸位过爱的意思。”那王尔调又道：“晚生还有一句话，不揣冒昧，合老世翁商议。”贾政道：“什么事？”王尔调陪笑道：“也是晚生的相与，做过南韶道的张大老爷家，有一位小姐，说是生的德容功貌俱全，此时尚未受聘。他又没有儿子，家资巨万，但是要富贵双全的人家，女婿又要出众，才肯作亲。晚生来了两个月，瞧着宝二爷的人品学业，都是必要大成的。老世翁这样门楣，还有何说！若晚生过去，包管一说就成。”贾政道：“宝玉说亲，却也是年纪了，并且老太太常说起。但只张大老爷素来尚未深悉。”詹光道：“王兄所提张家，晚生却也知道，况合大老爷那边是旧亲，老世翁一问便知。”贾政想了一回，道：“大老爷那边，不曾听得这门亲戚。”詹光道：“老世翁原来不知：这张府上原和邢舅太爷那边有亲的。”贾政听了，方知是邢夫人的亲戚。坐了一回，进来了，便要同王夫人说知，转问邢夫人去。谁知王夫人陪了薛姨妈到凤姐那边看巧姐儿去了。那天已经掌灯时候，薛姨妈去了，王夫人才过来了。贾政告诉了王尔调和詹光的话，又问：“巧姐儿怎么了？”王夫人道：“怕是惊风的光景。”贾政道：“不甚利害呀？”王夫人道：“看着是搐风的来头，只还没搐出来呢。”贾政听了，了一声，便不言语，各自安歇不提。\n　　却说次日邢夫人过贾母这边来请安，王夫人便提起张家的事，一面回贾母，一面问邢夫人。邢夫人道：“张家虽系老亲，但近年来久已不通音信，不知他家的姑娘是怎么样的。倒是前日孙亲家太太打发婆子来问安，却说起张家的事，说他家有个姑娘，托孙亲家那边有对劲的提一提。听见说，只这一个女孩儿，十分娇养，也识得几个字，见不得大阵仗儿，常在屋里不出来的。张大老爷又说：只有这一个女孩儿，不肯嫁出去，怕人家公婆严，姑娘受不得委屈。必要女婿过门，赘在他家，给他料理些家事。”贾母听到这里，不等说完，便道：“这断使不得。我们宝玉，别人伏侍他还不够呢，倒给人家当家去！”邢夫人道：“正是老太太这个话。”贾母因向王夫人道：“你回来告诉你老爷，就说我的话：这张家的亲事是作不得的。”王夫人答应了。贾母便问：“你们昨日看巧姐儿怎么样？头里平儿来回我，说很不大好，我也要过去看看呢。”邢王二夫人道：“老太太虽疼他，他那里耽的住？”贾母道：“却也不止为他，我也要走动走动，活活筋骨儿。”说着，便吩咐：“你们吃饭去罢，回来同我过去。”邢王二夫人答应着出来，各自去了。\n　　一时吃了饭，都来陪贾母到凤姐房中。凤姐连忙出来，接了进去。贾母便问：“巧姐儿到底怎么样？”凤姐儿道：“只怕是搐风的来头。”贾母道：“这么着还不请人赶着瞧？”凤姐道：“已经请去了。”贾母因同邢、王二夫人进房来看。只见奶子抱着，用桃红绫子小绵被儿裹着，脸皮趣青，眉梢鼻翅微有动意。贾母同邢、王二夫人看了看，便出外间坐下。正说间，只见一个小丫头，回凤姐道：“老爷打发人问姐儿怎么样。”凤姐道：“替我回老爷，就说请大夫去了。一会儿开了方子，就过去回老爷。”贾母忽然想起张家的事来，向王夫人道：“你该就去告诉你老爷，省了人家去说了，回来又驳回。”又问邢夫人道：“你们和张家如今为什么不走了？”邢夫人因又说：“论起那张家行事，也难合咱们作亲，太啬克，没的玷辱了宝玉。”凤姐听了这话，巳知八九，便问道：“太太不是说宝兄弟的亲事？”邢夫人道：“可不是么。”贾母接着，因把刚才的话，告诉凤姐。凤姐笑道：“不是我当着老祖宗太太们跟前说句大胆的话：现放着天配的姻缘，何用别处去找？”贾母笑问道：“在那里？”凤姐道：“一个‘宝玉’一个‘金锁’，老太太怎么忘了？”贾母笑了一笑，因说：“昨日你姑妈在这里，你为什么不提？”凤姐道：“老祖宗和太太们在前头，那里有我们小孩子家说话的地方？况且姨妈过来瞧老祖宗，怎么提这些个？这也得太太们过去求亲才是。”贾母笑了，邢王二夫人也都笑了。贾母因道：“可是我背晦了。”\n　　说着，人回：“大夫来了。”贾母便坐在外间，邢王二夫人略避。那大夫同贾琏进来，给贾母请了安，方进房中。看了出来，站在地下，躬身回贾母道：“姐儿一半是内热，一半是惊风。须先用一剂发散风痰药，还要用四神散才好，因病势来的不轻。如今的牛黄都是假的，要找真牛黄方用得。”贾母道了乏。那大夫同贾琏出去，开了方子，去了。凤姐道：“人参家里常有，这牛黄倒怕未必有。外头买去，只是要真的才好。”王夫人道：“等我打发人到姨太太那边去找找。他家蟠儿向来和那些西客们做买卖，或者有真的，也未可知。我叫人去问问。”正说话间众妹妹都来瞧来了，坐了一回，也都跟着贾母等去了。\n　　这里煎了药，给巧姐儿灌下去了，只见喀的一声，连药带痰都吐出来，凤姐才略放了一点儿心。只见王夫人那边的小丫头，拿着一点儿的小红纸包儿，说道：“二奶奶，牛黄有了。太太说了，叫二奶奶亲自把分两对准了呢。”凤姐答应着接过来，便叫平儿配齐了真珠、冰片、朱砂，快熬起来。自己用戥子按方秤了，搀在里面，等巧姐儿醒了好给他吃。只见贾环掀帘进来，说：“二姐姐，你们巧姐儿怎么了？妈叫我来瞧瞧他。”凤姐见了他母子便嫌，说：“好些了。你回去说，叫你们姨娘想着。”那贾环口里答应着，只管各处瞧看。看了一回，便问凤姐儿道：“你这里听见说有牛黄，不知牛黄是怎么个样儿？给我瞧瞧呢。”凤姐道：“你别在这里闹了，姐儿才好些。那牛黄都煎上了。”贾环听了，便去伸手拿那铞子瞧时，岂知措手不及，‘沸’的一声，铞子倒了，火已泼灭了一半。贾环见不是事，自觉没趣，连忙跑了。凤姐急的火星直爆，骂道：“真真那一世的对头冤家！你何苦来还来使促狭！从前你妈要想害我，如今又来害姐儿，我和你几辈子的仇呢？”一面骂平儿不照应。\n　　正骂着，只见丫头来找贾环。凤姐道：“你去告诉赵姨娘，说他操心也太苦了！巧姐儿死定了，不用他惦着了。”平儿急忙在那里配药再熬。那丫头摸不着头脑，便悄悄问平儿道：“二奶奶为什么生气？”平儿将环哥弄倒药铞子说了一遍。丫头道：“怪不得他不敢回来，躲了别处去了。这环哥儿明日还不知怎么样呢。平姐姐我替你收拾罢。”平儿说：“这倒不消。幸亏牛黄还有一点，如今配好了，你去罢。”丫头道：“我一准回去告诉赵姨奶奶，也省了他天天说嘴。”丫头回去，果然告诉了赵姨娘。赵姨娘气的叫快找环儿。环儿在外间屋子里躲着，被丫头找了来。赵姨娘便骂道：“你这个下作种子！你为什么弄洒了人家的药，招的人家咒骂？我原叫你去问一声，不用进去。你偏进去，又不就走，还要‘虎头上捉虱子’！你看我回了老爷打你不打！”这里赵姨娘正说着，只听贾环在外间屋子里，更说出些惊心动魄的话来。\n未知何言，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Aunt Xue’s rage at Jingui’s tantrum had brought on a liver attack and a pain in her left side. Knowing the cause, Baochai did not wait for the doctor but sent at once to buy some gambir-plant, which she decocted and gave to her mother. Then she and Qiuling massaged her legs and rubbed her chest until by degrees the pain eased. Still, Aunt Xue felt both angry and wretched — angry because of Jingui’s outrageous behaviour, wretched because Baochai’s forbearance struck her as pathetic. Baochai, after exhorting her to take things easier, dozed off; and by the time she woke, her mother’s liver attack had gradually subsided.\n\n“You mustn’t upset yourself like this, mother,” she said. “In a few days, when you’re able to walk, why not call on the old lady and Aunt Xifeng for a chat to cheer yourself up? Qiuling and I can look after things here, and I’m sure Jingui won’t dare try any more tricks.”\n\nAunt Xue nodded. “We’ll see in a couple of days,” she said.\n\nTo return to the Rong Mansion. After the Imperial Consort’s recovery, the whole household was in high spirits. Some days later several eunuchs called bringing gifts and silver from Her Highness to reward the family for their concern and the trouble they had taken. When the things and money had been handed over, Jia She and Jia Zheng reported this to the Lady Dowager and the whole family expressed its gratitude. The eunuchs were served tea and then took their leave.\n\nWhen the family returned to the Lady Dowager’s quarters and had chatted for a time, an old servant announced that the pages outside had reported: “Someone from another mansion has come to ask for the elder master on urgent business.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager told Jia She, “You may go.”\n\nHe assented and withdrew.\n\nThen the old lady, reminded of something, said to Jia Zheng with a smile, “Her Highness is very concerned about Baoyu. The other day she specially asked after him.”\n\n“But Baoyu is so unwilling to study that he’s unworthy of Her Highness’ favour,” replied Jia Zheng.\n\n“I put in a good word for him, saying that recently he’s been writing essays.”\n\nJia Zheng smiled. “That’s not true, of course.”\n\n“You often send him out to write poems and essays, doesn’t he manage all right? You must teach children gradually. As the saying goes, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day.’”\n\nJia Zheng had to agree.\n\n“Speaking of Baoyu,” the old lady continued, “there’s something I want to discuss with you. He’s growing up now and you should keep your eyes open for a good girl to betroth him to. This is a serious business — his whole future is at stake. It doesn’t matter whether she’s related to us or not, rich or poor; the main thing is to find a girl with a sweet temper and good looks.”\n\n“Quite right, madam. But the girl must be good, and first of all he must make something of himself. Otherwise he might spoil some girl’s whole life, and that would be too bad.”\n\nThis answer rather displeased the Lady Dowager. “As his parents, you should see to this, not leave it to me,” she said. “But I can’t help worrying because Baoyu has grown up with me and I’ve probably spoilt him, making him neglect his studies. Still, he doesn’t look a bad sort and seems good-natured — I don’t think he’s so hopeless as to spoil some girl’s life. Maybe I’m partial, but he seems to me slightly better than Huan. What do you think?”\n\nJia Zheng flushed. “Of course you’re a better judge of character than I am, madam,” he replied hastily. “Since you think him good and lucky, no doubt he is.”\n\n“It’s because he’s too anxious for the boy to turn out well. In fact, he may be like what the ancients said: ‘A man does not know the faults of his son.’” This made the Lady Dowager laugh, and the others joined in.\n\n“You’re not so young any more either,” she told Jia Zheng, “and as an official you’re naturally growing more dignified and steady day by day.” She turned to smile at Lady Xing and Lady Wang. “When he was young he was even more of an eccentric than Baoyu. But not till after he married did he start behaving a little more like a human being.” She shook her head. “Yet now he’s always finding fault with Baoyu. To my mind, Baoyu’s more like a human being than he was.”\n\nLady Xing and Lady Wang smiled.\n“You’re in a joking mood again, madam,” they said.\n\nJust then some young maids came in to tell Yuanyang that dinner was ready and ask for the old lady’s instructions.\n“What are you whispering about again?” asked the Lady Dowager.\nYuanyang told her with a smile.\n“In that case, you can all go to dinner,” said the old lady. “Just leave Xifeng and Zhen’s wife to keep me company.”\n\nJia Zheng and the two ladies assented. They saw that the table was laid, and not until the Lady Dowager urged them again to go did they withdraw and disperse.\n\nLady Xing went back to her own quarters, while Jia Zheng and Lady Wang returned to their apartment.\n“The old lady is so fond of Baoyu,” he remarked, “yet she wants him to study hard so that one day he can win success in the examinations. Then he’ll be worthy of her love and won’t ruin the future of the girl he marries.”\n“Of course you’re right,” agreed Lady Wang.\n\nJia Zheng then sent a maid to tell Li Gui, “When Baoyu comes back from school, let him have his meal first; then tell him to come here. I want to question him further.”\nLi Gui assented.\n\nWhen Baoyu came back from school and was about to go to pay his respects to his father, Li Gui said, “Don’t go yet, Master Bao. The master says you’re to have your meal first, then go to see him. He says he has questions to ask you.”\n\nThis news gave Baoyu another bad fright. He had to pay his respects to the Lady Dowager first, then go back to the Garden for his meal. Having bolted this down, he rinsed his mouth and hurried to his father’s study.\n\nJia Zheng was sitting in his inner study. Baoyu went in to pay his respects and stood waiting.\n“I’ve had other things on my mind these last few days and forgot to ask you,” said Jia Zheng. “The other day your tutor said that after a month of revision he would start you on composition. It must be nearly two months now. Have you started yet?”\n“I’ve written three essays,” said Baoyu. “But my tutor said there was no need to tell you yet, sir. He’ll let you know when I’ve made a little more progress. So I didn’t venture to report it.”\n“What were the topics?”\n“The first was ‘At fifteen I set my heart upon learning,’ the second ‘Not to feel hurt when others ignore one,’ and the third ‘Then he turned to the ink-slab.’”\n“Have you the drafts?”\n“Yes, I copied them out and my tutor corrected them.”\n“Have you brought them home or are they at school?”\n“At school.”\n“Send to fetch them. I want to see them.”\n\nBaoyu hastily sent a servant to tell Beiming: “Go to the school and fetch from the drawer of my desk a thin bamboo-paper notebook labelled ‘Window Essays.’ Bring it quickly.”\n\nSoon Beiming brought it and handed it to Baoyu, who presented it to his father. Jia Zheng opened it and saw that the first essay was entitled “At fifteen I set my heart upon learning.”\n\nXue. His original opening had been: “The sage who aspired to learning did so from childhood.” But Dai-ru had crossed out “childhood” and written in “fifteen”.\n\n“The word ‘childhood’ is too vague,” observed Jia Zheng. “Childhood lasts from infancy right up to the age of fifteen. This chapter describes the progress of the sage’s learning through the years, and that is why the text specifies each particular age: fifteen, thirty, forty, right through to seventy. Each age has its own specific achievement. By changing ‘childhood’ to ‘fifteen’, your tutor has made the sentence much clearer.”\n\nHe came to the next section. The original (which had been crossed out) had read: “It is common for men not to apply themselves to learning.” Jia Zheng shook his head: “That is not only childish, it shows a fundamental lack of scholarly ambition.”\n\nHe read the next sentence: “Is it not rather remarkable then that the sage should have applied himself at the age of fifteen?” and commented: “That is even worse!”\n\nHe turned to Dai-ru’s amended version: “Do not all men study? And yet how few persevere in their study! Is this not what the sage had in mind when he spoke of his own fifteenth year?”\n\n“Do you understand the correction?” he asked Bao-yu.\n\n“Yes,” replied Bao-yu.\n\nJia Zheng proceeded to the second essay, the theme of which was: “He does not mind if others take no note of his ability.” He began by reading Dai-ru’s version: “Not to mind if others take no note of one’s ability is a sure sign of true contentment.” Then he looked at the original, which had been crossed out: “Not to mind is to be free of all petty ambition and therefore the mark of a true scholar.”\n\n“What do you mean by this?” he asked Bao-yu. “The first part of your sentence is a mere paraphrase of the text, and the second part confuses the whole argument by introducing the word ‘scholar’. The version as corrected is the only acceptable one. You must try to grasp these distinctions.”\n\nBao-yu assented. Jia Zheng read on: “For surely it is common for a man to mind if others take no note of his ability. The exception to this rule is the man who is truly content. Who but such a man could achieve this frame of mind?” The original final sentence had been: “Is this not the true scholar?”\n\n“This suffers from the same defect as your first essay,” commented Jia Zheng. “The corrected version is acceptable, if a little stark.”\n\nHe came to the third essay. The theme was: “Then they turned to Mohism.” He read the title and thought for a moment with his head in the air.\n\n“Has your tutor reached this passage with you yet?” he asked Bao-yu.\n\n“Yes, sir,” replied Bao-yu. “He said he thought Mencius would be easier for me, so he taught me that first. We finished it the day before yesterday and we have just begun on The Analects.”\n\nJia Zheng turned back to the essay and saw that on this occasion there were only minor corrections. The opening was: “To exclude the teachings of Yang is to turn to those of Mo.”\n\n“The second part is the hardest,” said Jia Zheng.\n\n“For surely Mo did not intend that men should turn to him. And yet his teachings have spread throughout the world. If we exclude Yang, then must we not turn to Mo?”\n\n“Did you write this yourself?” asked Jia Zheng.\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Bao-yu.\n\nJia Zheng nodded.\n\n“It is not particularly outstanding,” he said, “but for a first attempt it is adequate. When I was in office a year or two ago, I used to set papers for the local matriculation candidates. However hard I tried to think of an original theme, they had always written on it before, and all they could do was to copy out their old essays. Have you ever studied this one?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Bao-yu.\n\n“I want you to think of a new angle. I don’t mind if you only write the opening. But it must be original.”\n\nBao-yu stood with head bowed, concentrating his mind on this new theme.\n\nJia Zheng himself stood, hands clasped behind his back, staring out of the door and frowning with the intensity of his own thought. He was still standing there when a young page came scurrying along from the inner gate and, catching sight of him, stopped dead in his tracks and stood to attention.\n\n“What do you want?” asked Jia Zheng.\n\n“Her Ladyship sent me,” replied the page. “Her younger sister has arrived and Mrs Lian says would you please give orders for a meal to be prepared.”\n\nNot a word was said as the boy left. Baoyu, who had been missing Bacchai badly since her move home, had assumed that she had come with her mother and was overjoyed. So, plucking up courage, he answered, \"I have made a start, but I don't know if it's any good.\"\n\n\"Let me hear it,\" said his father.\n\nBaoyu recited, \"Not all men in the world are scholars, yet few are those without property.\"\n\nJia Zheng nodded. \"Not too bad,\" he commented. \"When you write an essay you must make a careful analysis and think out the meaning clearly before starting. Does your grandmother know that you are here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In that case, go back to her now.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Baoyu withdrew slowly and with deference, but once past the screen in the moon-gate of the covered walk he streaked like smoke to the Lady Dowager's courtyard. Beiming, running frantically after him, called, \"Mind you don't fall! The master's coming.\"\n\nBaoyu paid no attention. As he entered the gate he heard laughter and voices — those of Lady Wang, Xifeng and Tanchun. The maids on duty raised the portiere and announced softly, \"Madam Xue is here.\"\n\nBaoyu hurried in to pay his respects to his aunt, then greeted his grandmother.\n\n\"Why are you so late today?\" asked the Lady Dowager.\n\nHe described how his father had examined him and told him to write the opening of an essay.\n\nThe old lady beamed.\n\nThen he asked the others, \"Where is Cousin Baochai?\"\n\n\"She didn't come,\" Aunt Xue told him. \"She's at home working with Xiangling.\"\n\nBaoyu was very disappointed but could not very well leave at once. As they chatted, dinner was served and of course his grandmother and aunt took the seats of honour, with Tanchun in the place of honour opposite.\n\n\"What about Baoyu?\" asked Aunt Xue.\n\nThe Lady Dowager answered with a smile, \"Let him sit by me.\"\n\nBaoyu replied, \"When school ended, Li Gui passed on my father's order that I should go to him after dinner. So I hurriedly ate a bowl of tea with a dish of vegetables, then went over. Please go ahead without me, madam, aunt and cousins.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the old lady, \"Xifeng can come and sit by me. Your wife just said she's fasting today, so they can eat by themselves.\"\n\nLady Wang agreed, \"Yes, you go ahead with the old lady and aunt. Don't wait for me. I'm fasting.\"\n\nSo Xifeng asked permission to sit down and a maid set a cup and chopsticks for her. She took the wine-kettle to fill all their cups before resuming her seat.\n\nAs they drank the Lady Dowager asked, \"Just now, aunt, you mentioned Xiangling. The other day I heard the maids refer to 'Qiuling' and, not knowing who they meant, found on inquiry that it was her. Why has that good child changed her name again?\"\n\nAunt Xue flushed and sighed.\n\n\"Don't ask, madam!\" she begged. \"Since Pan married that tiresome wife of his, they're forever squabbling and have made our whole household a laughingstock. I've spoken to her several times, but she's so pig-headed and won't listen. I haven't the energy to keep on scolding them, so I have to let them be. She's the one who didn't like the girl's name and changed it.\"\n\n\"What does a name matter?\" asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n\"I feel most embarrassed about it,\" replied Aunt Xue. \"Actually, you know how it is in your household, madam. It wasn't the name she objected to, but the fact that Bacchai had given it that made her determined to change it.\"\n\n\"What ever for?\"\n\nAs for the way, now Xifeng is always having tiffs with Baochai. The other day the old lady sent to ask after me, and they were having a row just then.”\n\n“The other day I heard that Aunt Xue had a liver attack and meant to send to ask after her,” said the Lady Dowager quickly. “But then I heard she was better, so I didn’t send. Take my advice, my dear, and just ignore such things. Besides, they’re only a young couple newly married; they’ll settle down by and by. I think Baochai’s such a sweet-tempered, good-natured girl, though so young she’s several times better than older people. The other day, when the maid came back, we were praising her here — a girl with her breadth of mind and good temper is one in a hundred. I don’t want to talk out of turn, but a daughter-in-law like that is bound to be loved by her parents-in-law and the whole household.”\n\nBaoyu, who had already heard enough of this, had been wanting to leave on some pretext; but now, at this praise of Baochai, he sat down again to listen.\n\n“It’s no use,” said Aunt Xue. “Good as she is, she’s only a girl. And I’ve a stupid son like Pan to worry me. I’m really afraid that drinking outside he may get into trouble. Luckily the two young gentlemen here in the old lady’s place often go around with him — that sets my mind at rest a little.”\n\n“You’ve no call to worry, aunt,” put in Baoyu. “Cousin Pan’s friends are all respectable business people, very well-behaved. How could he get into trouble?”\n\n“If that’s the case, I needn’t worry,” she replied with a smile.\n\nBy now the meal was over and Baoyu, taking his leave first, announced, “I have to study this evening,” and went off.\n\nAs the maids were serving tea, Hupo came over to whisper something in the Lady Dowager’s ear.\n\n“Go quickly, Xifeng,” said the old lady. “Go and see what’s happened to Qiaojie.”\n\nXifeng, not knowing what she meant, was nonplussed, as were all the others. Then Hupo came up to her.\n\n“Just now Pinger sent a maid to ask you to go back quickly, madam, because Qiaojie is unwell,” she said.\n\n“In that case, you’d better go,” said the Lady Dowager. “Aunt Xue is one of the family.”\n\nXifeng assented and, having apologized to Aunt Xue, was told by Lady Wang, “You go on first. I’ll follow. Children’s souls aren’t firmly rooted, so don’t let the maids make a great commotion. They must keep an eye on the cats and dogs in the house too. A child’s easily upset, and there are so many little things to watch.”\n\nXifeng agreed and went back to her room with her maids.\n\nThen Aunt Xue asked after Daiyu’s health.\n\n“That child’s all right,” said the Lady Dowager. “But she takes things too much to heart, and that makes her rather delicate. In intelligence she’s the equal of Baochai, but not so sweet-tempered and considerate.”\n\nAfter a little further chat Aunt Xue said, “You must rest now, madam. I’m going home to see how things are, as only Baochai and Xiangling are there. I’ll go with Lady Wang to see Qiaojie.”\n\n“Quite right,” agreed the Lady Dowager. “As you’re older, you can see what’s wrong with the child and tell them what to do.”\n\nSo Aunt Xue took her leave and went with Lady Wang to Xifeng’s compound.\n\nWhen Jia Zheng had finished testing Baoyu he felt rather pleased, and was strolling outside chatting with his secretaries about the poems just composed. Wang Ertiao, alias Wang Mei, who was a recent arrival and a fine chess-player, observed, “From what we have just seen, Master Bao is....”\n\n\"Young Bao-yu has made great progress in his studies,\" said Zhan Guang.\n\n\"Progress?\" said Jia Zheng. 'He has merely acquired a smattering of knowledge. He is a long way yet from any real learning.'\n\n\"You are too modest, sir,\" said Zhan Guang. 'Mr Wang and I are both of the same opinion: that your son is destined to go far.'\n\n'You are very kind,' said Jia Zheng with a smile.\n\n'There is one other matter, sir,' Wang Er-tiao ventured. 'I hardly know how to put it. But I should like to have your opinion.'\n\n'Oh? What is it?'\n\n'An acquaintance of mine,' replied Wang, 'a former Intendant of the Nan-Shao Circuit, by the name of Zhang, has a daughter who is said to possess all the womanly virtues, and great beauty into the bargain. She is not yet betrothed. Mr Zhang has no son, and is extremely wealthy. He is looking for a son-in-law from a family such as yours, with wealth and honour to its name, but most important of all he wants an outstanding young man. During the two months I have been here, I have observed Master Bao's character and his diligence in his studies, and have concluded that he is bound to be a great success. With your family standing, sir, the match would be perfect. If you were to commission me as go-between, I am sure that my first mention of it would be met with acceptance.'\n\n'Bao-yu is certainly of an age to be betrothed,' replied Jia Zheng. 'And my mother has often mentioned the subject. But I do not know this Mr Zhang very well.'\n\n'The Zhangs to whom Brother Wang refers,' put in Zhan Guang, 'are known to me. They are in fact old family connections of Sir She's. You have only to ask him, sir.'\n\nJia Zheng thought for a moment.\n\n'I have never heard my brother mention these particular relatives.'\n\n'Then you are not aware, sir,' said Zhan Guang, 'that they are related to Lady Xing's family?'\n\nJia Zheng now realized that they were on Lady Xing's side. He sat a little longer and then went in, intending to tell Lady Wang and ask her to make further inquiries of Lady Xing. He found, however, that Lady Wang had accompanied Aunt Xue to see Qiao-jie at Xi-feng's apartment. It was already lamp-lighting time when Aunt Xue left, and Lady Wang returned to her own apartment. Jia Zheng told her of Wang Er-tiao's and Zhan Guang's proposal, and then asked:\n\n'How is Qiao-jie?'\n\n'The symptoms suggest infantile convulsions,' replied Lady Wang.\n\n'Is it serious?'\n\n'It looks like convulsions, but the convulsions have not actually started yet.'\n\nJia Zheng said nothing, but sighed, and they both retired for the night.\n\nThe next day, when Lady Xing came to pay her morning respects to Grandmother Jia, Lady Wang took the opportunity to mention the Zhang proposal, informing Grandmother Jia at the same time and asking Lady Xing for her opinion.\n\n'The Zhangs are old family connections,' said Lady Xing, 'but we have had no news of them for years, and I really don't know what the daughter is like. The other day, however, the nanny sent by Lady Sun to inquire after us did mention the Zhangs. She said that they have a daughter, and that they have asked the Suns to find a suitable family for her. According to her, the girl is their only child and has been utterly spoilt. She can read a few words, but is not presentable in company and stays indoors most of the time. Mr Zhang says that as she is his only daughter he cannot bear to send her away to be a daughter-in-law; he is afraid that her parents-in-law might be too strict and that she would not be able to cope. So he insists that the husband must marry into their family, and live with them and manage their affairs for them.'\n\nBefore she could say any more, Grandmother Jia interrupted:\n\n'That would never do! Our Bao-yu needs all the attention he can get himself. How could he possibly manage another family's affairs?'\n\n'My thoughts exactly,' said Lady Xing.\n\nGrandmother Jia turned to Lady Wang:\n\n'Tell Zheng from me that this Zhang family is quite out of the question.'\n\nLady Wang assented.\n\n'How did you find Qiao-jie yesterday?' asked Grandmother Jia. 'Patience came to see me and said she was very poorly. I have been meaning to go over myself.'\n\n'We know how much you love her,' said Lady Xing and Lady Wang together. 'But she is in no fit state to receive you.'\n\nThe Lady Dowager said, “It’s not just for her sake either. I need some exercise to work my limbs.”\n\nWith that she gave orders: “Go and have your meal now, then come and accompany me there.” Lady Xing and Lady Wang assented and went off.\n\nAfter the meal they returned to escort the old lady to Xifeng’s rooms. Xifeng hastily came out to welcome them in.\n\n“What’s really the matter with Little Qiao?” the Lady Dowager asked.\n\n“I’m afraid it may be convulsions,” said Xifeng.\n\n“Then why haven’t you sent for a doctor at once?”\n\n“I have.”\n\nThe old lady went in with Lady Xing and Lady Wang to see the child. The nurse was holding her, wrapped in a peach-red silk wadded quilt. Her little face was bluish, and the corners of her eyebrows and nostrils were twitching slightly. Having looked at her, the Lady Dowager and the other two ladies went back to the outer room and sat down.\n\nJust then a young maid came in to report to Xifeng, “The master has sent to ask how the little girl is.”\n\n“Tell him from me that we’ve sent for the doctor,” Xifeng answered. “When he’s written his prescription, I’ll send it to the master.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager, reminded by this of the Zhang family, said to Lady Wang, “You should go and tell your husband straight away, to save that family applying only to be turned down.”\n\nShe asked Lady Xing, “Why have you stopped having dealings with the Zhangs?”\n\n“Judging by the way they behave, they’re not fit to be related to us,” said Lady Xing. “They’re too stingy and vulgar. They’d only disgrace Baoyu.”\n\nThis gave Xifeng a rough idea what they were talking about. “Are you discussing Cousin Baoyu’s marriage, madam?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” said Lady Xing.\n\nThen the Lady Dowager described their conversation just now.\n\nXifeng said with a smile, “Don’t blame me for speaking out of turn, but why look elsewhere for a match when a Heaven-sent one is ready to hand?”\n\n“Where?” the Lady Dowager wanted to know.\n\n“A‘precious jade’ and a ‘golden locket’ — have you forgotten that, madam?”\n\nThe old lady smiled.\n\n“Why didn’t you mention it yesterday when your aunt was here?” she asked.\n\n“With our Old Ancestress and Their Ladyships present, how could a junior like me bring that up? Besides, when Aunt Xue came to see you, Old Ancestress, how could I speak of such things? Their Ladyships should send a proposal.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager chuckled, and Lady Xing and Lady Wang smiled too.\n\n“I must be in my dotage,” said the old lady.\n\nJust then it was announced that the doctor had come. She remained seated in the outer room while Lady Xing and Lady Wang withdrew. The doctor, ushered in by Jia Lian, paid his respects to the Lady Dowager before going inside to examine the child. When he came out he stood below her, bowing.\n\n“The little girl has some fever and slight convulsions,” he reported. “First she must take a draught to dispel the phlegm and wind; then she should have a powder of four miracle-working ingredients, as the attack is rather serious. Most bezoar sold nowadays is false; we must have the genuine thing.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager thanked him and he went off with Jia Lian to write his prescription.\n\n“We usually have ginseng in the house,” said Xifeng, “but probably not bezoar. We must get the real thing if we buy any outside.”\n\n“I’ll send to Aunt Xue to ask if she has any,” said Lady Wang. “Since her Pan does business with Western merchants, they may have the real thing. I’ll send to find out.”\n\nAs they were talking, the other young ladies called to see the child. They sat with them for a while, then left with the Lady Dowager.\n\nXifeng brewed the medicine and had it given to Qiao-jie. The child retched and brought up the medicine with some phlegm, at which Xifeng felt a little relieved. Then a young maid from Lady Wang’s apartment brought in a small red packet.\n\n“Madam Lian,” she announced, “here’s the bezoar. Her Ladyship says you’re to weigh out the right amount yourself.”\n\nXifeng assented and took it, then told Pinger to prepare pearl, borneol and cinnabar and brew them quickly. She herself weighed out the right amount of bezoar and mixed it in, ready to give to Qiaojie when she woke up.\n\nJust then Jia Huan lifted the portiere and stepped in.\n\n“How is Qiaojie, sister?” he asked. “My mother sent me to find out.”\n\nThe sight of him and his mother never failed to annoy Xifeng.\n\n“She’s better,” she replied. “You can go back and tell your mother not to worry.”\n\nJia Huan, having assented, looked around the room. After a while he asked:\n\n“I hear you have some bezoar here. What’s it like? Do show me.”\n\n“Don’t come here making trouble,” Xifeng scolded. “The child’s just a little better. The bezoar’s being decocted now.”\n\nWhen he heard this he reached out to take the pot, but his hand knocked against it. Over it went with a sizzling sound, spilling half the contents and putting out the fire. Realizing that he had done wrong, Jia Huan took himself off in confusion.\n\nXifeng flared up.\n\n“You’re my sworn enemy from some former life!” she swore. “Why must you keep playing such dirty tricks? In the past your mother tried to do me in; now you come to hurt my child. What generations of hatred is this between us?” She also scolded Pinger for not intervening.\n\nAs she was storming, a maid came in looking for Jia Huan.\n\n“Go and tell Concubine Zhao,” fumed Xifeng, “that she’s worrying herself too much! Qiaojie’s bound to die, so she needn’t concern herself any more.”\n\nPinger, hastily preparing another brew of medicine, was too busy to answer. The maid, not knowing what had happened, asked her softly:\n\n“What’s made Madam Lian so angry?”\n\nPinger told her how Master Huan had knocked over the medicine pot.\n\n“No wonder he didn’t dare go back but sneaked off somewhere,” exclaimed the maid. “Who knows what will become of Master Huan tomorrow! Let me clear up for you, sister.”\n\n“Don’t trouble,” said Pinger. “Luckily there’s still a little bezoar left. I’ve mixed it, so you can go now.”\n\n“I’ll go straight back and tell Madam Zhao to stop her gloating,” promised the maid.\n\nUpon her return she did report this to Concubine Zhao, who in a rage sent to have Huan found. He was hiding in the outer room, and the maids dragged him in.\n\n“You degenerate!” swore his mother. “Why did you spill their medicine and make them curse us? I told you simply to ask how the child was, not to go in. But in you went, and instead of leaving at once you had to court disaster! Just wait till I tell the master — he’ll give you a beating!”\n\nBut as she was berating him, Jia Huan in the outer room blurted out something which made her catch her breath.\n\nTo know what it was, read the next chapter."
