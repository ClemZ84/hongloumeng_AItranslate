  "original": "话说贾母自王夫人处回来，见宝玉一日好似一日，心中自是欢喜。因怕将来贾政又叫他，遂命人将贾政的亲随小厮头儿唤来，吩咐：“以后倘有会人待客诸样的事，你老爷要叫宝玉，你不用上来传话，就回他说我说的，一则打重了，得着实将养几个月才走得，二则他的星宿不利，祭了星，不见外人，过了八月，才许出二门。”那小厮头儿听了，领命而去。贾母又命李嬷嬷、袭人等来，将此话说与宝玉，使他放心。那宝玉素日本就懒与士大夫诸男人接谈，又最厌峨冠礼服贺吊往还等事，今日得了这句话，越发得意了，不但将亲戚朋友一概杜绝了，而且连家庭中晨昏定省一发都随他的便了。日日只在园中游玩坐卧，不过每日一清早到贾母、王夫人处走走就回来了，却每日甘心为诸丫头充役，倒也得十分消闲日月。或如宝钗辈有时见机劝导，反生起气来，只说：“好好的一个清净洁白女子，也学的钓名沽誉，入了国贼禄鬼之流。这总是前人无故生事，立意造言，原为引导后世的须眉浊物。不想我生不幸，亦且琼闺绣阁中亦染此风，真真有负天地钟灵蔬秀之德了！”众人见他如此，也都不向他说正经话了。独有黛玉自幼儿不曾劝他去立身扬名，所以深敬黛玉。\n　　闲言少述。如今且说凤姐，自见金钏儿死后，忽见几家仆人常来孝敬他些东西，又不时的来请安奉承，自己倒生了疑惑，不知何意。这日又见人来孝敬他东西，因晚间无人时笑问平儿。平儿冷笑道：“奶奶连这个都想不起来了？我猜他们的女孩儿都必是太太屋里的丫头，如今太太屋里有四个大的，一个月一两银的分例，下剩的都是一个月只几百钱。如今金钏儿死了，必定他们要弄这一两银子的窝儿呢。”凤姐听了，笑道：“是了，是了，倒是你想的不错。只是这起人也太不知足。钱也赚够了，苦事情又据不着他们，弄个丫头搪塞身子儿也就罢了，又要想这个巧宗儿！他们几家的钱也不是容易花到我跟前的，这可是他们自寻。送什么我就收什么，横竖我有主意。”凤姐儿安下这个心，所以只管耽延着，等那些人把东西送足了，然后乘空方回王夫人。\n　　这日午间，薛姨妈、宝钗、黛玉等正在王夫人屋里，大家吃西瓜。凤姐儿得便回王夫人道：“自从玉钏儿的姐姐死了，太太跟前少着一个人，太太或看准了那个丫头，就吩咐了，下月好发放月钱。”王夫人听了，想了一想道：“依我说，什么是例，必定四个五个的？够使就罢了，竟可以免了罢。”凤姐笑道：“论理，太太说的也是。只是原是旧例，别人屋里还有两个呢，太太倒不按例了。况且省下一两银子，也有限的。”王夫人听了，又想了想道：“也罢，这个分例只管关了来，不用补人，就把这一两银子给他妹妹玉钏儿罢。他姐姐伏侍了我一场，没个好结果，剩下他妹妹跟着我，吃个双分儿也不为过。”凤姐答应着，回头望着玉钏儿笑道：“大喜，大喜！”玉钏儿过来磕了头。\n　　王夫人又问道：“正要问你：如今赵姨娘、周姨娘的月例多少？”凤姐道：“那是定例，每人二两。赵姨娘有环兄弟的二两，共是四两，另外四串钱。”王夫人道：“月月可都按数给他们？”凤姐见问得奇，忙道：“怎么不按数给呢！”王夫人道：“前儿恍惚听见有人抱怨，说短了一串钱，什么原故？”凤姐忙笑道：“姨娘们的丫头月例，原是人各一吊钱，从旧年他们外头商量的，姨娘们每位丫头，分例减半，人各五百钱。每位两个丫头，所以短了一吊钱。这事其实不在我手里，我倒乐得给他们呢，只是外头扣着，这里我不过是接手儿，怎么来怎么去，由不得我做主。我倒说了两三回，仍旧添上这两分儿为是，他们说了‘只有这个数儿’，叫我也难再说了。如今我手里给他们，每月连日子都不错。先时候儿在外头关，那个月不打饥荒，何曾顺顺溜溜的得过一遭儿呢。”王夫人听说，就停了半晌，又问：“老太太屋里几个一两的？”凤姐道：“八个。如今只有七个，那一个是袭人。”王夫人说：“这就是了。你宝兄弟也并没有一两的丫头，袭人还算老太太房里的人。”凤姐笑道：“袭人还是老太太的人，不过给了宝兄弟使，他这一两银子还在老太太的丫头分例上领。如今说因为袭人是宝玉的人，裁了这一两银子，断乎使不得。若说再添一个人给老太太，这个还可以裁他。若不裁他，须得环兄弟屋里也添上一个，才公道均匀了。就是晴雯、麝月他们七个大丫头，每月人各月钱一吊，佳蕙他们八个小丫头们，每月人各月钱五百，还是老太太的话，别人也恼不得气不得呀。”\n　　薛姨妈笑道：“你们只听凤丫头的嘴，倒象倒了核桃车子似的。账也清楚，理也公道。”凤姐笑道：“姑妈，难道我说错了吗？”薛姨妈笑道：“说的何尝错，只是你慢着些儿说不省力些？”凤姐才要笑，忙又忍住了，听王夫人示下。王夫人想了半日，向凤姐道：“明儿挑一个丫头送给老太太使唤，补袭人，把袭人的一分裁了。把我每月的月例，二十两银子里拿出二两银子一吊钱来，给袭人去。以后凡事有赵姨娘、周姨娘的，也有袭人的，只是袭人的这一分，都从我的分例上匀出来，不必动官中的就是了。”凤姐一一的答应了，笑推薛姨妈道：“姑妈听见了？我素日说的话如何？今儿果然应了。”薛姨妈道：“早就该这么着。那孩子模样儿不用说，只是他那行事儿的大方，见人说话儿的和气，里头带着刚硬要强，倒实在难得的。”王夫人含泪说道：“你们那里知道袭人那孩子的好处？比我的宝玉还强十倍呢！宝玉果然有造化，能够得他长长远远的伏侍一辈子，也就罢了。”凤姐道：“既这么样，就开了脸，明放他在屋里不好？“王夫人道：“这不好：一则年轻；二则老爷也不许；三则宝玉见袭人是他的丫头，纵有放纵的事，倒能听他的劝，如今做了跟前人，那袭人该劝的也不敢十分劝了。如今且浑着，等再过二三年再说。”\n　　说毕，凤姐见无话，便转身出来。刚至廊檐下，只见有几个执事的媳妇子正等他回事呢，见他出来，都笑道：“奶奶今儿回什么事，说了这半天？可别热着罢。”凤姐把袖子挽了几挽，着那角门的门槛子，笑道：“这里过堂风，倒凉快，吹一吹再走。”又告诉众人道：“你们说我回了这半日的话，太太把二百年的事都想起来问我，难道我不说罢？”又冷笑道：“我从今以后，倒要干几件刻薄事了。抱怨给太太听，我也不怕！糊涂油蒙了心、烂了舌头、不得好死的下作娼妇们，别做娘的春梦了！明儿一裹脑子扣的日子还有呢。如今裁了丫头的钱就抱怨了咱们，也不想想自己也配使三个丫头！”一面骂，一面方走了，自去挑人回贾母话去，不在话下。\n　　却说薛姨妈等这里吃毕西瓜，又说了一回闲话儿，各自散去。宝钗与黛玉回至园中，宝钗要约着黛玉往藕香榭去，黛玉因说还要洗澡，便各自散了。宝钗独自行来，顺路进了恰红院，竟欲寻宝玉去说话儿，以解午倦。不想步入院中，鸦雀无闻，一并连两只仙鹤在芭蕉下都睡着了。宝钗便顺着游廊，来至房中。只见外间床上横三竖四，都是丫头们睡觉。转过十锦棍子，来至宝玉的房内，宝玉在床上睡着了，袭人坐在身旁，手里做针线，傍边放着一柄白犀麈。\n　　宝钗走近前来，悄悄的笑道：“你也过于小心了。这个屋里还有苍蝇蚊子？还拿蝇刷子赶什么？”袭人不防，猛抬头见是宝钗，忙放针线起身，悄悄笑道：“姑娘来了，我倒不防，唬了一跳。姑娘不知道，虽然没有苍蝇蚊子，谁知有一种小虫子，从这纱眼里钻进来，人也看不见。只睡着了咬一口，就象蚂蚁叮的。”宝钗道：“怨不得，这屋子后头又近水，又都是香花儿，这屋子里头又香，这种虫子部是花心里长的，闻香就扑。”说着，一面就瞧他手里的针线。原来是个白缕红里的兜肚，上面扎着鸳鸯戏莲的花样，红莲绿叶，五色鸳鸯。宝钗道：“嗳哟，好鲜亮活计。这是谁的，也值的费这么大工夫？”袭人向床上努嘴儿。宝钗笑道：“这么大了，还带这个？”袭人笑道：“他原是不带，所以特特的做的好了，叫他看见，由不得不带。如今天热，睡觉都不留神，哄他带上了，就是夜里纵盖不严些儿，也就罢了。——你说这一个就用了工夫，还没看见他身上带的那一个呢！”宝钗笑道：“也亏你耐烦。”袭人道：“今儿做的工夫大了，脖子低的怪酸的。”又笑道：“好姑娘，你略坐一坐，我出去走走就来。”说着就走了。宝钗只顾看着活计便不留心，一蹲身，刚刚的也坐在袭人方才坐的那个所在。因又见那个活计实在可爱，不由的拿起针来，就替他作。\n　　不想黛玉因遇见湘云，约他来与袭人道喜，二人来至院中。见静悄悄的，湘云便转身先到厢房里去找袭人去了。那黛玉却来至窗外，隔着窗纱往里一看，只见宝玉穿着银红纱衫子，随便睡着在床上，宝钗坐在身旁做针线，傍边放着蝇刷子。黛玉见了这个景况，早已呆了，连忙把身子一躲，半日又握着嘴笑，却不敢笑出来，便招手儿叫湘云。湘云见他这般，只当有什么新闻，忙也来看，才要笑，忽然想起宝钗素日待他厚道，便忙掩住口。知道黛玉得里不让人，怕他取笑，便忙拉过他来，道：“走罢。我想起袭人来，他说晌午要到池子里去洗衣裳，想必去了，咱们找他去罢。”黛玉心下明白，冷笑了两声，只得随他走了。\n　　这里宝钗只刚做了两三个花瓣，忽见宝玉在梦中喊骂，说：“和尚道士的话如何信得？什么‘金玉姻缘’？我偏说‘木石姻缘’！”宝钗听了这话，不觉怔了。忽见袭人走进来，笑道：“还没醒呢吗？”宝钗摇头。袭人又笑道：“我才碰见林姑娘、史大姑娘，他们进来了么？”宝钗道：“没见他们进来。”因向袭人笑道：“他们没告诉你什么？”袭人红了脸，笑道：“总不过是他们那些玩话，有什么正经说的。”宝钗笑道：“今儿他们说的可不是玩话，我正要告诉你呢，你又忙忙的出去了。”一句话末完，只见凤姐打发人来叫袭人。宝钗笑道：“就是为那话了。”袭人只得叫起两个丫头来，同着宝钗出恰红院，自往凤姐这里来。果然是告诉他这话，又教他给王夫人磕头，且不必去见贾母。倒把袭人说的甚觉不好意思。\n　　及见过王夫人回来，宝玉已醒，问起原故，袭人且含糊答应。至夜间人静，袭人方告诉了。宝玉喜不自禁，又向他笑道：“我可看你回家去不去了！那一回往家里走了一趟，回来就说你哥哥要赎你，又说在这里没着落，终久算什么，说那些无情无义的生分话唬我。从今我可看谁来敢叫你去？”袭人听了，冷笑道：“你倒别这么说。从此以后，我是太太的人了，我要走，连你也不必告诉，只回了太太就走。”宝玉笑道：“就算我不好，你回了太太去了，叫别人听见说我不好，你去了，你有什么意思呢？”袭人笑道：“有什么没意思的？难道下流人我也跟着罢？再不然还有个死呢！人活百岁，横竖要死，这口气没了，听不见看不见就罢了。”宝玉听见这话，便忙握他的嘴，说道：“罢罢，你别说这些话了。”袭人深知宝玉性情古怪，听见奉承吉利话，又厌虚而不实，听了这些近情的实话，又生悲感。也后悔自己冒撞，连忙笑着，用话截开，只拣宝玉那素日喜欢的，说些春风秋月，粉淡脂红，然后又说到女儿如何好。不觉又说到女儿死的上头。袭人忙掩住口。\n　　宝玉听至浓快处，见他不说了，便笑道：“人谁不死？只要死的好。那些须眉浊物只听见‘文死谏’‘武死战’这二死是大丈夫的名节，便只管胡闹起来。那里知道有昏君，方有死谏之臣，只顾他邀名，猛拚一死，将来置君父于何地？必定有刀兵，方有死战，他只顾图汗马之功，猛拚一死，将来弃国于何地？”袭人不等说完，便道：“古时候儿这些人，也因出于不得巳他才死啊。”宝玉道：“那武将要是疏谋少略的，他自己无能，白送了性命，这难道也是不得已么？那文官更不比武官了，他念两句书，记在心里，苦朝廷少有瑕疵，他就胡弹乱谏，邀忠烈之名；倘有不合，浊气一涌，即时拚死，这难道也是不得已？要知道那朝廷是受命于天，若非圣人，那天也断断不把这万几重任交代。可知那些死的，都是沽名钓誉，并不知君臣的大义。比如我此时若果有造化，趁着你们都在眼前，我就死了，再能够你们哭我的眼泪，流成大河，把我的尸首漂起来，送到那鸦雀不到的幽僻去处，随风化了，彼此再不托生为人，这就是我死的得时了。”袭人忽见说出这些疯话来，忙说：“困了。”不再答言。那宝玉方合眼睡着。次日也就丢开。\n　　一日，宝玉因各处游的腻烦，便想起《牡丹亭》曲子来，自己看了两遍，犹不惬怀，因闻得梨香院的十二个女孩儿中，有个小旦龄官，唱的最妙。因出了角门来找时，只见葵官、药官都在院内，见宝玉来了，都笑迎让坐。宝玉因问：“龄官在那里？”都告诉他说：“在他屋里呢。”宝玉忙至他屋内，只见龄官独自躺在枕上，见他进来，动也不动。宝玉身旁坐下，因素昔与别的女孩子玩惯了的，只当龄官也和别人一样，遂近前陪笑，央他起来唱一套‘袅晴丝’。不想龄官见他坐下，忙抬起身来躲避，正色说道：“嗓子哑了，前儿娘娘传进我们去，我还没有唱呢。”宝玉见他坐正了，再一细看，原来就是那日蔷薇花下画“蔷”字的那一个。又见如此景况，从来未经过这样被人弃厌，自己便讪讪的，红了脸，只得出来了。\n　　药官等不解何故，因问其所以，宝玉便告诉了他。宝官笑说道：“只略等一等，蔷二爷来了，他叫唱是必唱的。”宝玉听了，心下纳闷，因问：“蔷哥儿那里去了？”宝官道：“才出去了，一定就是龄官儿要什么，他去变弄去了。”宝玉听了以为奇特。少站片时，果见贾蔷从外头来了，手里提着个雀儿笼子，上面扎着小戏台，并一个雀儿，兴兴头头往里来找龄官。见了宝玉，只得站住。宝玉问他：“是个什么雀儿？”贾蔷笑道：“是个玉顶儿，还会衔旗串戏。”宝玉道：“多少钱买的？”贾蔷道：“一两八钱银子。”一面说，一面让宝玉坐，自己往龄官屋里来。\n　　宝玉此刻把听曲子的心都没了，且要看他和龄官是怎么样。只见贾蔷进去，笑道：“你来瞧这个玩意儿。”龄官起身问：“是什么？”贾蔷道：“买了个雀儿给你玩，省了你天天儿发闷。我先玩个你瞧瞧。”说着，便拿些谷子，哄的你瞧瞧。”说着，便拿些谷子，哄的那个雀儿果然在那戏台上衔着鬼脸儿和旗帜乱串。众女孩子都笑了，独龄官冷笑两声，赌气仍睡着去了。贾蔷还只管陪笑问他：“好不好？”龄官道：“你们家把好好儿的人弄了来，关在这牢坑里，学这个还不算，你这会子又弄个雀儿来，也干这个浪事。你分明弄了来打趣形容我们，还问‘好不好’！”贾蔷听了，不觉站起来，连忙赌神起誓，又道：“今儿我那里的糊涂油蒙了心，费一二两银子买他，原说解闷儿，就没想到这上头。罢了，放了生，倒也免你的灾。”说着，果然将那雀儿放了，一顿把那笼子拆了。龄官还说：“那雀儿虽不如人，他也有个老雀儿在窝里，你拿了他来，弄这个劳什子，也忍得？今儿我咳嗽出两口血来，太太打发人来找你，叫你请大夫来细问问，你且弄这个来取笑儿。偏是我这没人管没人理的，又偏爱害病！”贾蔷听说，连忙说道：“昨儿晚上我问了大夫，他说：‘不相干，吃两剂药，后儿再瞧。’谁知今儿又吐了？这会子就请他去。”说着便要请去。龄官又叫：“站住，这会子大毒日头地下，你赌气去请了来，我也不瞧。”贾蔷听如此说，只得又站住。\n　　宝玉见了这般景况，不觉痴了。这才领会过画“蔷”深意。自己站不住，便抽身走了。贾蔷一心都在龄官身上，竟不曾理会，倒是别的女孩子送出来了。那宝玉一心裁夺盘算，痴痴的回至怡红院中，正值黛玉和袭人坐着说话儿呢。宝玉一进来，就和袭人长叹，说道：“我昨儿晚上的话，竞说错了，怪不得老爷说我是‘管窥蠢测’。昨夜说你们的眼泪单葬我，这就错了。看来我竟不能全得。从此后，只好各人得各人的眼泪罢了。”袭人只道昨夜不过是些玩话，已经忘了，不想宝玉又提起来，便笑道：“你可真真有些个疯了。”宝玉默默不对。自此深悟人生情缘，各有分定，只是每每暗伤：“不知将来葬我洒泪者为谁？”\n　　且说黛玉当下见宝玉如此形象，便知是又从那里着了魔来，也不便多问，因说道：“我才在舅母跟前，听见说明儿是薛姨妈的生日，叫我顺便来问你出去不出去，你打发人前头说一声去。”宝玉道：“上回连大老爷的生日我也没去，这会子我又去，倘或碰见了人呢？我一概都不去。这么怪热的，又穿衣裳！我不去，姨妈也未必恼。”袭人忙道：“这是什么话？他比不得大老爷。这里又住的近，又是亲戚，你不去，岂不叫他思量？你怕热，就清早起来，到那里磕个头、吃钟茶再来，岂不好看？”宝玉尚未说话，黛玉便先笑道：“你看着人家赶蚊子的分上，也该去走走。”宝玉不解，忙问：“怎么赶蚊子？”袭人便将昨日睡觉无人作伴，宝姑娘坐了一坐的话，告诉宝玉。宝玉听了，忙说：“不该，我怎么睡着了，就亵渎了他。”一面又说：“明日必去。”\n正说着，忽见湘云穿得齐齐整整的走来，辞说家里打发人来接他。宝玉、黛玉听说，忙站起来让坐，湘云也不坐，宝黛两个只得送他至前面。那湘云只是眼泪汪汪的，见有他家的人在跟前，又不敢十分委屈。少时宝钗赶来，愈觉缱绻难舍。还是宝钗心内明白，他家里人若回去告诉了他婶娘，待他家去了，又恐怕他受气，因此倒催着他走了。众人送至二门前，宝玉还要往外送他，倒是湘云拦住了。一时，回身又叫宝玉到跟前，悄悄的嘱咐道：“就是老太太想不起我来，你时常提着，好等老太太打发人接我去。”宝玉连连答应了。眼看着他上车去了，大家方才进来。\n要知端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "After calling on Lady Wang, the Lady Dowager was delighted to find Baoyu improving daily. But afraid that his father might send for him again, she summoned the head-page who attended Jia Zheng and instructed him:\n\n“If your master wants Baoyu to receive guests or for any other reason, don’t report it to me. Just tell him that on the doctor’s orders Baoyu is not to leave his bed for some months, because of the severe beating he had. Besides, the stars are against him just now. He’s sacrificed to them but mustn’t see any outsiders until after the eighth month. Not till then may he go outside the inner gate.”\n\nThe page assented and withdrew.\n\nThen the Lady Dowager sent for Nanny Li and Xiren and told them to reassure Baoyu with this message. He had always hated having to talk to pedantic officials and the like, or to dress up to pay calls or offer congratulations or condolences. So this news elated him. Not only did he refuse to see any friends or relatives, but he ignored even the daily routine of his own household. Simply spending his time strolling or lounging in the garden, the only formality he observed was going early each morning to pay his respects to his grandmother and mother, after which he was only too glad to run errands for the maids, thus enjoying a completely free and easy existence.\n\nWhen Bacchai and the others seized opportunities to urge him to do something worthwhile, he lost his temper.\n\n“What a pure, lovely girl you are to have been contaminated too by the dust of this world!” he would exclaim. “This is all the fault of those old pedants of the past who, for no reason at all, invented these phrases and maxims to fool posterity. It’s my bad luck to be born into this generation, and worse still to find that even girls are infected with this vulgar nonsense — a positive insult to heaven and earth which endowed them with sweet, pure natures.”\n\nAfter that, none of them spoke seriously to him again. Daiyu alone had never advised him to seek fame and official advancement, for which he respected her deeply.\n\nBut enough of this.\n\nLet us return to Xifeng. After Jinchuan’s death some servants had started bringing her presents from time to time and coming to pay their respects, which rather puzzled her until one evening when she was free she asked Pinger the reason.\n\n“Don’t tell me you can’t figure it out, madam,” said Pinger with a smile. “My guess is that all their daughters work in Her Ladyship’s apartments. She has four senior maids with a monthly allowance of one tael apiece, while the others get only a few hundred cash. Now that Jinchuan’s dead they’re after that one tael vacancy.”\n\n“Of course!” Xifeng chuckled. “You may be right. But these people are never satisfied. They make plenty of money and have no heavy work to do, yet they’re not content to have their daughters working as maids but must angle for this soft job. It’s not easy for them to spend their money on me, but since they’re asking for it I’ll accept whatever they send. I know how to deal with them.”\n\nHaving made up her mind to this, she delayed taking any action until she had received enough presents. Then she seized a chance to speak to Lady Wang.\n\nIt happened that Aunt Xue, Bacchai and Daiyu were in Lady Wang’s room eating water-melons.\n\n“Since the death of Yuchuan’s sister,” said Xifeng, “you’re one maid short in your apartments, madam. If you’ve decided which girl to promote, just let me know and I’ll issue her pay next month.”\n\nAfter a little thought Lady Wang replied, “What’s the use of having a fixed number? We should have just as many as we need. We can dispense with this one.”\n\n“You’re quite right, madam. But that’s the rule. Even the other ladies have two apiece. It wouldn’t look right for you to have less. Besides, one tael a month is a very small saving.”\n\nAfter a moment’s reflection Lady Wang continued, “Well, never mind. We needn’t fill her place but can give her allowance to her sister Yuchuan. After all, their sister served me well yet came to a bad end, and since Yuchuan is still with me I don’t think two shares for her would be too much.”\n\nXifeng assented and turned to smile at Yuchuan. “Many congratulations!” she cried.\n\nYuchuan stepped forward and kotowed her thanks.\n\n“I meant to ask you,” said Lady Wang. “What are Concubines Zhao and Zhou allowed each month?”\n\n“The regulation amount is two taels each,” replied Xifeng. “But Concubine Zhao has an extra two for Huan, making four taels in all, plus four strings of cash.”\n\n“Do they get their full allowance every month?”\n\nSurprised, Xifeng answered quickly, “Of course.”\n\n“The other day I overheard someone complaining that a string of cash was missing. How was that?”\n\nXifeng smiled. “The concubines’ maids are each allowed one string of cash, but last year the stewards outside proposed cutting this in half to five hundred cash for each maid. As each concubine has two maids, that makes one string less. This isn’t my doing. I’d be only too glad to let them have the money, but it’s held back outside. I simply pass on what I receive and have no say in the matter. In fact, I suggested two or three times that they should be given the full amount, but the stewards said, ‘This is all there is for them.’ So I couldn’t very well say any more. Now when I pay them each month, I make sure there’s no delay. In the old days, when the payments were made outside, which month passed without some trouble? They were never paid off as smoothly as this.”\n\nLady Wang was silent for a while. Then she asked, “How many maids in the old lady’s apartments have a monthly allowance of one tael?”\n\n“Eight. But now there are only seven because one of them is Xiren.”\n\n“That’s right. As Pao-yu has no maid with a tael allowance, Xiren still counts as one of the old lady’s maids.”\n\n“Yes, Xiren is still on the old lady’s staff but assigned to Pao-yu. So she draws her tael of silver as one of the old lady’s maids. If this were cut on the grounds that she’s now Pao-yu’s maid, that would never do. We could only cut it if we gave the old lady another maid in her place. And if we don’t cut it, to be fair we should give Huan another maid too. As for the seven senior maids like Ching-wen and Sheh-yueh, they get a string of cash a month; and the eight younger ones like Chiahui get five hundred cash. That was the old lady’s decision, so no one can complain.”\n\nAunt Hsueh laughed. “Listen to Feng, rattling on like a cartload of walnuts! But her accounts are clear and she’s fair-minded too.”\n\n“Don’t tell me I’m wrong, aunt,” said Hsi-feng.\n\n“Of course you’re not wrong. I only wonder if it wouldn’t save breath to speak a little more slowly.”\n\nHsi-feng started laughing but quickly checked herself and waited to hear Lady Wang’s decision.\n\nAfter some thought Lady Wang said, “I think we should choose one of our maids to replace Xiren in the old lady’s apartments, then cancel Xiren’s allowance. I’ll give Xiren two taels and a string of cash from my monthly twenty taels. In future, whatever the concubines Chao and Chou get, Xiren must have the same. But this extra allowance for her must come from my share, not from the general fund.”\n\nHsi-feng assented cheerfully and turned with a smile to Aunt Hsueh. “Did you hear that, aunt? This just shows how right I always am.”\n\n\"High time too! There's no need to speak of her good looks, but the charming, natural way she has with people and her quiet good sense are rare indeed.\"\n\nLady Wang said with tears, \"You don't know all Xiren's good qualities. She's ten times better than my Baoyu. If he's lucky enough to have her wait on him all his life, that will be all I ask.\"\n\n\"If that's how it is, why not let him have her openly as his concubine?\" proposed Xifeng.\n\n\"That wouldn't do,\" said Lady Wang. \"For one thing, she's still young. For another, his father wouldn't allow it. Besides, Baoyu looks on Xiren as one of his own maids, so even if he's self-willed he'll listen to her advice. But if she were his concubine she wouldn't be able to remonstrate so freely. Better leave it like this for the next couple of years.\"\n\nWhen Xifeng had no more to say she withdrew. On the verandah outside some stewards' wives were waiting to report on the day's business.\n\n\"You've been a long time, madam,\" they said smiling. \"You must be hot.\"\n\nXifeng rolled up her sleeves and leaned against the door-post.\n\n\"There's a draught here which is rather pleasant,\" she replied. \"I'll cool off before I go.\" She went on, \"You tell me I've been a long time. Her Ladyship was asking me about things that happened two hundred years ago. How could I help being delayed?\"\n\nShe gave a scornful laugh. \"From now on I mean to be a bit sterner. I don't care if they complain to Her Ladyship. Let those bitches stew in their own juice. The muddle-headed, malicious trollops! They'd better not dream of getting round me. One of these days I'll beat the whole lot of them to a pulp. Now that we're cutting down the number of maids, they start complaining. They should ask themselves if they're entitled to three maids apiece!\"\n\nStill muttering angrily she went off to choose someone to report to the Lady Dowager.\n\nBut let us return to Aunt Xue, who after finishing the melon went on chatting for a while before the party broke up. Bacchai and Daiyu went back to the Garden, the former proposing that they call on Xiangyun, but Daiyu said she wanted to have a bath and so they went their different ways.\n\nBacchai, on her own, decided to call on Baoyu to while away the time and overcome her drowsiness. But when she reached his compound all was quiet. Even the two storks were asleep under the plantain. She made her way along the covered walk to his room, and saw that the outer room was strewn with maids sleeping at all angles. Having slipped past the bookcase she entered his bedroom, There Baoyu lay asleep on his bed and Xiren was sitting beside him sewing, a fly-whisk by her side.\n\n\"You're over-cautious,\" said Bacchai with a smile, going over. \"Are there any flies or mosquitoes in here that you need a fly-whisk?\"\n\nXiren looked up with a start at the sound of her voice.\n\n\"It gave me quite a turn,\" she whispered, putting down her work and rising to her feet. \"You don't know, miss, we may have no flies or mosquitoes, but there are lots of midges which slip in through the gauze. You can't see them, but they bite and it stings like anything.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" agreed Bacchai. \"This place is near the water and there are plenty of sweet flowers all around, so of course these little insects which breed in the core of blossoms come here attracted by the scent.\"\n\nAs she spoke she inspected the work in Xiren's hand. It was a white silk stomacher lined with red, embroidered with a design of mandarin ducks among pink lotus and green duckweed.\n\n\"Why, this is really gorgeous!\" she exclaimed. \"Who is it for, that you're taking so much trouble?\"\n\nXiren pointed with her lips towards the bed.\n“Fancy someone of his age still wearing that!” remarked Baochai.\n“He didn’t at first, so I made it nicely on purpose to tempt him to wear it,” Xiren told her. “Now that the weather’s so hot he doesn’t bother to cover himself properly when he sleeps, I coax him into wearing this for fear he may kick off his coverlet in the night and catch cold. If you think this was quite a job to make, you should see the one he wears over his chest.”\n“You certainly have patience,” approved Baochai.\n“I’ve been working so long today that my neck aches.” Xiren smiled. “Do sit down for a bit, miss, while I take a little stroll outside.” With that she left.\nToo intent on the sewing to think of anything else, Baochai sank down on the very same seat that Xiren had just vacated. And so fascinated was she by the beautiful work that she could not help picking up the needle to add a few stitches.\nNow Daiyu and Xiangyun had agreed to come to congratulate Xiren. When they reached the courtyard and all seemed quiet, Xiangyun turned back to look for Xiren in the side rooms while Daiyu went to the window and peeped through the gauze. She saw Baoyu in a silver-red silk tunic lying asleep on his bed and Baochai sitting beside him sewing. There was a fly-whisk by her side.\nThe sight so astonished Daiyu that, first, she covered her mouth to stifle a laugh; then, not venturing to laugh aloud, she beckoned to Xiangyun with a wave of her hand. Xiangyun, thinking there was some news, hurried over to look. She was about to laugh too when she remembered how good Baochai had always been to her and checked herself. And knowing how sarcastic Daiyu could be, she was afraid Baochai might be embarrassed. So she dragged Daiyu away, saying:\n“Come along. I’ve just remembered that Xiren said she was going to the pool at noon to wash some clothes. I expect she’s there. Let’s go and look for her.”\nDaiyu saw through this but could only chuckle cynically and go with her.\nBaochai had just embroidered two or three petals when she heard Baoyu cry out in his dreams:\n“Who believes what bonzes and Taoists say? What’s this talk about a match between gold and jade? I insist on a match between stone and wood!”\nThis shocked her, but just then Xiren came in.\n“Is he still asleep?” she asked.\nBaochai shook her head.\n“I just met Miss Lin and Miss Shi,” continued Xiren. “Did they come in?”\n“I didn’t see them,” said Baochai. Then she asked with a smile, “Did they tell you their news?”\nXiren blushed.\n“They were just joking, as usual. Nothing serious.”\n“Today it was no joke. I was just going to tell you when you hurried off.”\nBefore she could say any more a maid arrived from Xifeng to fetch Xiren.\n“That’s what it must be,” said Baochai.\nXiren called two maids and left Happy Red Court with Baochai to go to Xifeng’s apartments. Sure enough, the message was to tell her the good news and to order her to go and kotow to Lady Wang but not to the Lady Dowager. Xiren felt quite embarrassed.\nUpon her return, Baoyu was awake and asked the reason for the summons; but Xiren gave him an evasive answer. Not until that evening when all was quiet did she tell him the truth. He was overjoyed.\n“Now I’d like to see you go home,” he teased. “That time you went home you came back and told me your brother meant to redeem you, that you’d no future here and so on — all that heartless talk to scare me. From now on, who’ll dare ask for you to be sent away?”\nXiren smiled ironically.\n“Don’t you be so sure,” she retorted.\n\n\"Now that I belong to Her Ladyship, if I want to leave there's no need even to tell you. I shall just ask her permission and go.\"\n\n\"If I've behaved badly,\" he said with a smile, \"if you go and ask her permission and others hear that it's because I'm so bad, what good will it do you to leave?\"\n\n\"What good? Do you expect me to stay on with a scoundrel? If the worst comes to the worst, I can always die. We all have to die some day, anyhow. Once I stop breathing and can't see or hear, that will be the end of it.\"\n\nBaoyu hastily put his hand over her mouth.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" he cried. \"Don't say such things.\"\n\nXiren knew his eccentricity: fulsome compliments and pious wishes disgusted him as hypocritical, yet the truth upset him. She regretted her indiscretion and tried to pass it off with a smile, changing the subject to the spring breeze and autumn moon, the charm of powder and rouge, then the superlative goodness of girls — until inadvertently she came back to the death of girls. Xiren hastily broke off.\n\nJust when Baoyu was most intrigued she stopped, and he asked with a smile, \"We all have to die, but to die a good death is the thing. Those hairy, vulgar males who believe that a civil officer should die for remonstrating with his sovereign, and a military officer should die on the battlefield, think this the two ways for a true man to win fame, so they act recklessly. They don't realize that good sovereigns won't tolerate ministers who kill themselves after remonstrating; they're simply out for a reputation. By getting themselves killed, how do they expect their sovereign to carry on? A military officer can only die in battle if there's a war. By getting killed to win credit for military exploits, what sort of state will they leave their country in?\"\n\nBefore he could finish Xiren interposed, \"In ancient times these men had to die, there was no other way out.\"\n\nBaoyu retorted, \"A general who falls on the battlefield because he's a poor strategist and incompetent — is that a case of having to die? A civil officer is even worse. He remembers a couple of lines from some books, and if the government makes the slightest slip he remonstrates wildly to win a reputation for loyalty. If he's ignored, in a fit of anger he kills himself. Is that a case of having to die? You must remember that the Emperor's authority is Heaven-bestowed. If he weren't a sage, Heaven wouldn't have entrusted him with such heavy responsibilities. So all those who get killed are simply out for a reputation; they don't understand the true duty of a subject. For instance, if I should be so lucky as to die now with all of you around me, and your tears for me could form a great stream to float my corpse away to some silent place remote from crows and kites, there to vanish with the wind — if from then on I were never to be born again as a human being, that would be dying at the right time.\"\n\nHorrified by this crazy talk, Xiren said she was sleepy and would not answer him. Not until then did Baoyu drop the subject and go to sleep, and the next day he thought no more about it.\n\nOne day Baoyu, bored with all his wanderings, thought of the songs in The Peony Pavilion. But though he read through the text twice he was still not satisfied. Then he remembered that of the twelve actresses in Pear Fragrance Court, the one who played young female roles — Lingguan — sang best. So he went through the side gate to look for her, and found Kui-guan and Douguan in the courtyard. They greeted him smilingly and offered him a seat.\n\n\"Where's Lingguan?\" he asked.\n\n\"In her room,\" they told him.\n\nHe went to her room and found her lying alone on her bed. At his entrance she did not stir. Baoyu sat down beside her and, being used to playing with the other girls, moved closer and begged her with a smile to get up and sing for him the song beginning \"In the warm breeze the willows tremble.\"\n\nInstead of complying, Lingguan shifted away from him. Sitting up she said gravely, \"My voice is hoarse. The other day when Her Ladyship sent for us, I didn't even sing for her.\"\n\nAs she was sitting up properly now, Baoyu had a good look at her for the first time and was struck by her resemblance to someone, though he could not think who it was. Abashed, he left her room.\n\nLooking more closely, he saw that she was the girl he had watched from under the rose-arbour tracing the character “qiang” on the ground with her hairpin. Her present coldness was something he had never encountered before. Feeling snubbed, he blushed and made his way out.\n\nYao-guan and the others, not knowing what had happened, asked Baoyu why he had left. When he told them, Bao-guan said with a smile:\n\n“If you’d waited a bit, Qiang would have come. He can always make her sing.”\n\n“Where is he?” asked Baoyu in surprise.\n\n“He’s just gone out. No doubt Ling-guan wanted something and he’s gone to get it for her.”\n\nBaoyu thought this very strange. He had not been waiting long when Jia Qiang came in, beaming, with a bird-cage in his hand. On it was a tiny stage and in it a canary. He made straight for Ling-guan. At sight of Baoyu, however, he had to stop.\n\n“What bird is that?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“A canary with a white patch on its head,” Jia Qiang told him. “It can learn to pick out flags and perform on a stage.”\n\nHe invited Baoyu to sit down as he went on into Ling-guan’s room.\n\nBaoyu had now lost all interest in the opera. He wanted to see how Jia Qiang and Ling-guan behaved together. Jia Qiang went up to her with a smile.\n\n“Come and see this,” he said.\n\nLing-guan rose to her feet and asked what it was.\n\n“I’ve bought you a bird to amuse you and save you from moping all day. I’ll show you what it can do.”\n\nHe made the canary perform tricks on the stage with a mask and flags by tempting it with some bird-seed. The other girls laughed, but Ling-guan gave two snorts and lay down again in a huff.\n\n“Isn’t it good?” Jia Qiang asked with a smile.\n\n“Your family’s filled with clever people,” she retorted. “They drag us here and shut us up in this dump to learn this rotten singing; and now you’ve brought a bird in to do the same thing. Obviously you bought it to make fun of us, and yet you ask whether it’s good or not.”\n\nJia Qiang jumped up at once and protested with frantic vows:\n\n“I must have been crazy to spend a couple of taels on it — I just wanted to cheer you up. I’d no such sinister motive. All right, I’ll set it free to save you from bad luck.”\n\nThereupon he let the bird go and broke the cage to pieces.\n\n“That bird may not be human,” said Ling-guan, “but it has an old mother in its nest. How can you be so heartless as to trap it and make it do this disgusting tricks? I coughed blood today, and Her Ladyship sent to ask you to fetch the doctor; but instead you come here to amuse yourself with this. I’m a poor, helpless nobody, and it’s my fate to fall ill.”\n\n“I spoke to the doctor last night,” he told her. “He said it wasn’t serious, and after you’d taken a couple of doses he’d see you again the day after tomorrow. I didn’t know you’d been spitting blood again. I’ll go and fetch him at once.” He turned to go.\n\n“Stop!” she cried. “The sun’s so scorching hot now, what’s the sense in dashing off in a rage? I wouldn’t see him if you brought him.”\n\nAt that he had to stop.\n\nBaoyu, watching this scene, was completely carried away. Now he understood the meaning of the character “qiang” which she had traced on the ground. He could stay no longer but slipped away. So absorbed was Jia Qiang with Ling-guan that he paid no attention, but the other girls saw Baoyu out.\n\nAbsorbed in these reflections, Baoyu went back in a daze to Happy Red Court. He found Daiyu and Xiren sitting talking. At sight of him Xiren stopped, but Baoyu sighed and said:\n\n“How wrong I was!” he exclaimed. “No wonder my father calls me an ignorant fool. Last night I said you’d all weep for me when I died, but that was wrong. It seems I can’t hope for all your tears. From now on, each of you can give me your own tears and that’s all.”\n\nXiren thought he was still raving, having forgotten the nonsense he had talked the previous night.\n\n“You really are crazy,” she teased.\n\nBaoyu made no reply but reflected that everyone’s lot in life was predestined and each had his own share of love. Yet he could not help grieving in secret, wondering on whom in future he could count for those tears.\n\nDaiyu, seeing the state he was in, knew that he must have been brooding over something again, but she did not like to question him.\n\n“Just now, with my aunt, I heard that Aunt Xue’s birthday is the day after tomorrow,” she told him instead. “She asked me to find out whether you mean to go or not, so that you can send word to the front court if you do.”\n\n“I didn’t even go when it was the Elder Master’s birthday,” he retorted. “What if I run into people if I go now? I’m not going anywhere. Besides, it’s so hot and I’d have to dress up. Even if I don’t go, my aunt won’t be offended.”\n\n“What a way to talk!” Xiren put in. “This is different from the Elder Master’s birthday. She’s living so near and she’s a relative. If you don’t go, won’t she think it odd? If you’re afraid of the heat, you can go first thing in the morning to pay your respects and have a cup of tea, then come straight back. Wouldn’t that look better?”\n\nBefore Baoyu could answer, Daiyu interposed with a smile, “If only for the sake of the person who drove away the mosquitoes for you, you should go and show your appreciation.”\n\nBaoyu, quite at a loss, asked quickly, “What do you mean by ‘driving away mosquitoes’?”\n\nThen Xiren told him how Baochai had sat with her the previous night for a while as there was no one else to keep her company.\n\n“That was wrong of me!” he cried. “I never meant to show her disrespect by falling asleep like that. All right then, I’ll go tomorrow.”\n\nAs they were speaking, Xiangyun entered dressed fit to go out. She came to take her leave as her family had sent to fetch her.\n\nBaoyu and Daiyu at once stood up and offered her a seat, but she simply stood there while the two of them could hardly detain her and had to see her to the front court. Her eyes brimming with tears, she dared not give way to her distress in front of the servants from her home. And when Baochai hurried over, the parting became even more painful. But Baochai, being the most clear-headed, knew that if the servants reported this to Xiangyun’s aunt, the girl might be scolded after her return. And so she urged her to leave.\n\nThe others saw her to the inner gate. Baoyu would have gone further, but Xiangyun stopped him. Then, turning back, she whispered to him:\n\n“Do remind the old lady now and again to send for me if she should forget me.”\n\nHe promised to do this. And not until they had watched her get into her carriage did they all go back.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
