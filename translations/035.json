  "original": "话说宝钗分明听见黛玉克薄他，因惦记着母亲哥哥，并不回头，一径去了。这里黛玉仍旧立于花阴之下，远远的却向怡红院内望着。只见李纨、迎春、探春、惜春并丫鬟人等，都向怡红院内去过之后，一起一起的散尽了，只不见凤姐儿来。心里自己盘算说道：“他怎么不来瞧瞧宝玉呢？便是有事缠住了，他必定也是要来打个花胡哨，讨老太太、太太的好儿才是呢。今儿这早晚不来，必有原故。”一面猜疑，一面抬头再看时，只见花花簇簇一群人，又向恰红院内来了。定睛看时，却是贾母搭着凤姐的手，后头邢夫人、王夫人，跟着周姨娘并丫头媳妇等人，都进院去了。黛玉看了，不觉点头，想起有父母的好处来，早又泪珠满面。少顷，只见薛姨妈、宝钗也进去了。\n　　忽见紫鹃从背后走来，说道：“姑娘吃药去罢，开水又冷了。”黛玉道：“你到底要怎么样？只是催。我吃不吃，与你什么相干？”紫鹃笑道：“咳嗽的才好了些，又不吃药了。如今虽是五月里，天气热，到底也还该小心些。大清早起，在这个潮地上站了半日，也该回去歇歇了。”一句话提醒了黛玉，方觉得有点儿腿酸，呆了半日，方慢慢的扶着紫鹃，回到潇湘馆来。一进院门，只见满地下竹影参差，苔痕浓淡，不觉又想起《西厢记》中所云“幽僻处可有人行？点苍苔白露泠泠”二句来，因暗暗的叹道：“双文虽然命薄，尚有孀母弱弟；今日我黛玉之薄命，一并连孀母弱弟俱无。”想到这里，又欲滴下泪来。不防廊下的鹦哥见黛玉来了，“嘎”的一声扑了下来，倒吓了一跳。因说道：“你作死呢，又扇了我一头灰。”那鹦哥又飞上架去，便叫：“雪雁，快掀帘子，姑娘来了！”黛玉便止住步，以手扣架，道：“添了食水不曾？”那鹦哥便长叹一声，竟大似黛玉素日吁嗟音韵，接着念道：“侬今葬花人笑痴，他年葬侬知是谁！”黛玉、紫鹃听了，都笑起来。紫鹃笑道：“这都是素日姑娘念的，难为他怎么记了。”黛玉便命将架摘下来另挂在月洞窗外的钩上。于是进了屋子，在月洞窗内坐了，吃毕药。只见窗外竹影映入纱窗，满屋内阴阴翠润，几覃生凉。黛玉无可释闷，便隔着纱窗，调逗鹦哥做戏，又将素日喜的诗词也教与他念。这且不在话下。\n　　且说宝钗来至家中，只见母亲正梳头呢，看见他进来，便笑着说道：“你这么早就梳上头了。”宝钗道：“我瞧瞧妈妈身上好不好。昨儿我去了，不知他可又过来闹了没有？”一面说，一面在他母亲身旁坐下，由不得哭将起来。薛姨妈见他一哭，自己掌不住也就哭了一场，一面又劝他：“我的儿，你别委屈了。你等我处分那孽障。你要有个好歹，叫我指望那一个呢？”薛蟠在外听见，连忙的跑过来，对着宝钗左一个揖右一个揖，只说：“好妹妹，恕我这次罢！原是我昨儿吃了酒，回来的晚了，路上撞客着了，来家没醒，不知胡说了些什么，连自己也不知道，怨不得你生气。”宝钗原是掩面而哭，听如此说，由不得也笑了，遂抬头向地下哼了一口，说道：“你不用做这些像生儿了。我知道你的心里，多嫌我们娘儿们，你是变着法儿叫我们离了你就心净了。”\n　　薛蟠听说，连忙笑道：“妹妹这从那里说起？妹妹从来不是这么多心说歪话的人哪。”薛姨妈忙又接着道：“你只会听你妹妹的‘歪话’，难道昨儿晚上你说的那些话，就使得吗？当真是你发昏了？”薛蟠道：“妈妈也不必生气，妹妹也不用烦恼，从今以后，我再不和他们一块儿喝酒了，好不好？”宝钗笑道：“这才明白过来了。”薛姨妈道：“你要有个横劲，那龙也下蛋了。”薛蟠道：“我要再和他们一处喝，妹妹听见了，只管啐我，再叫我畜生，不是人，如何？何苦来为我一个人，娘儿两个天天儿操心。妈妈为我生气还犹可，要只管叫妹妹为我操心，我更不是人了。如今父亲没了，我不能多孝顺妈妈，多疼妹妹，反叫娘母子生气、妹妹烦恼，连个畜生不如了！”口里说着，眼睛里掌不住掉下泪来。薛姨妈本不哭了，听他一说，又伤起心来。宝钗勉强笑道：“你闹够了，这会子又来招着妈妈哭了。”薛蟠听说，忙收泪笑道：“我何曾招妈妈哭来着？罢罢罢，扔下这个别提了，叫香菱来倒茶妹妹喝。”宝钗道：“我也不喝茶，等妈妈洗了手，我们就进去了。”薛蟠道：“妹妹的项圈我瞧瞧，只怕该炸一炸去了。”宝钗道：“黄澄澄的，又炸他做什么？”薛蟠又道：“妹妹如今也该添补些衣裳了，要什么颜色花样，告诉我。”宝钗道：“连那些衣裳我还没穿遍了，又做什么？”一时薛姨妈换了衣裳，拉着宝钗进去，薛蟠方出去了。\n　　这里薛姨妈和宝钗进园来看宝玉。到了怡红院中，只见抱厦里外回廊上许多丫头老婆站着，便知贾母等都在这里。母女两个进来，大家见过了。只见宝玉躺在榻上，薛姨妈问他：“可好些？”宝玉忙欲欠身，口里答应着：“好些。”又说：“只管惊动姨娘、姐姐，我当不起。”薛姨妈忙扶他睡下，又问他：“想什么，只管告诉我。”宝玉笑道：“我想起来，自然和姨娘要去。”王夫人又问：“你想什么吃？回来好给你送来。”宝玉笑道：“也倒不想什么吃。倒是那一回做的那小荷叶儿小莲蓬儿的汤还好些。”凤姐一旁笑道：“都听听，口味倒不算高贵，只是太磨牙了。巴巴儿的想这个吃！”贾母便一叠连声的叫做去。凤姐笑道：“老祖宗别急，我想想这模子是谁收着呢？”因回头吩咐个老婆问管厨房的去要。那老婆去了半天，来回话：“管厨房的说：‘四副汤模子都缴上来了。’”凤姐听说，又想了一想道：“我也记得交上来了，就只不记得交给谁了。多半是在茶房里。”又遣人去问管茶房的，也不曾收。次后还是管金银器的送了来了。\n　　薛姨妈先接过来瞧时，原来是个小匣子，里面装着四副银模子，都有一尺多长，一寸见方。上面凿着豆子大小，也有菊花的，也有梅花的，也有莲蓬的，也有菱角的：共有三四十样，打的十分精巧。因笑向贾母王夫人道：“你们府上也都想绝了，吃碗汤还有这些样子。要不说出来，我见了这个，也不认得是做什么用的。”凤姐儿也不等人说话，便笑道：“姑妈不知道：这是旧年备膳的时候儿，他们想的法儿。不知弄什么面印出来，借点新荷叶的清香，全仗着好汤，我吃着究竟也没什么意思。谁家长吃他？那一回呈样做了一回，他今儿怎么想起来了！”说着，接过来递与个妇人，吩咐厨房里立刻拿几只鸡，另外添了东西，做十碗汤来。王夫人道：“要这些做什么？”凤姐笑道：“有个原故：这一宗东西家常不大做，今儿宝兄弟提起来了，单做给他吃，老太太、姑妈、太太都不吃，似乎不大好。不如就势儿弄些大家吃吃，托赖着连我也尝个新儿。”贾母听了，笑道：“猴儿，把你乖的，拿着官中的钱做人情。”说的大家笑了。凤姐忙笑道：“这不相干。这个小东道儿我还孝敬的起。”便回头吩咐妇人：“说给厨房里，只管好生添补着做了，在我账上领银子。”婆子答应着去了。\n　　宝钗旁笑道：“我来了这么几年，留神看起来，二嫂子凭他怎么巧，再巧不过老太太。”贾母听说，便答道：“我的儿，我如今老了，那里还巧什么？当日我象凤丫头这么大年纪，比他还来得呢。他如今虽说不如我，也就算好了。比你姨娘强远了！你姨娘可怜见的，不大说话，和木头似的，公婆跟前就不献好儿。凤儿嘴乖，怎么怨得人疼他。”宝玉笑道：要这么说，不大说话的就不疼了？”贾母道：“不大说话的，又有不大说话的可疼之处，嘴乖的也有一宗可嫌的，倒不如不说的好。”宝玉笑道：“这就是了。我说大嫂子不大说话呢，老太太也是和凤姐姐一样的疼。要说单是会说话的可疼，这些姐妹里头也只凤姐姐和林妹妹可疼了。”贾母道：“提起姐妹，不是我当着姨太太的面奉承，千真万真，从我们家里四个女孩儿算起，都不如宝丫头。”薛姨妈听了，忙笑道：“这话是老太太说偏了。”王夫人忙又笑道：“老太太时常背地里和我说宝丫头好，这倒不是假说。”宝玉勾着贾母，原为要赞黛玉，不想反赞起宝钗来，倒也意出望外，便看着宝钗一笑。宝钗早扭过头去和袭人说话去了。\n　　忽有人来请吃饭，贾母方立起身来，命宝玉：“好生养着罢。”把丫头们又嘱咐了一回，方扶着凤姐儿，让着薛姨妈，大家出房去了。犹问：“汤好了不曾？”又问薛姨妈等：“想什么吃，只管告诉我，我有本事叫凤丫头弄了来咱们吃。”薛姨妈笑道：“老太太也会怄他，时常他弄了东西来孝敬，究竟又吃不多儿。”凤姐儿笑道：“姑妈倒别这么说。我们老祖宗只是嫌人肉酸，要不嫌人肉酸，早已把我还吃了呢！”一句话没说了，引的贾母众人都哈哈的大笑起来。宝玉在屋里也掌不住笑了。袭人笑道：“真真的二奶奶的嘴，怕死人。”\n　　宝玉伸手拉着袭人笑道：“你站了这半日，可乏了。”一面说，一面拉他身旁坐下。袭人笑道：“可是又忘了，趁宝姑娘在院子里，你和他说，烦他们莺儿来打上几根绦子。”宝玉笑道：“亏了你提起来。”说着，便仰头向窗外道：“宝姐姐，吃过饭叫莺儿来，烦他打几根绦子，可得闲儿？”宝钗听见，回头道：“是了，一会儿就叫他来。”贾母等尚未听真，都止步问宝钗何事。宝钗说明了，贾母便说道：“好孩子，你叫他来替你兄弟打几根罢。你要人使，我那里闲的丫多着的呢。你喜欢谁，只管叫来使唤。”薛姨妈、宝钗都笑道：“只管叫他来做就是了。有什么使唤的去处！他天天也是闲着淘气。”大家说着，往前正走，忽见湘云、平儿、香菱等在山石边掐凤仙花呢，见了他们走来，都迎上来了。\n　　少顷出至园外，王夫人恐贾母乏了，便欲让至上房内坐，贾母也觉脚酸，便点头依允。王未人便命丫头忙先去铺设坐位。那时赵姨娘推病，只有周姨娘与那老婆丫头们忙着打帘子，立靠背，铺褥子。贾母扶着凤姐儿进来，与薛姨妈分宾主坐了，宝钗、湘云坐在下面。王夫人亲自捧了茶来，奉与贾母，李宫裁捧与薛姨妈。贾母向王夫人道：“让他们小妯娌伏侍罢，在那里坐下，好说话儿。”王夫人方向一张小机子上坐下，便吩咐凤姐儿道：“老太太的饭放在这里，添了东西来。”凤姐儿答应出去，便命人去贾母那边告诉。那边的老婆们忙往外丫头们忙都赶过来。王夫人便命：“请姑娘们去。”请了半天，只有探春、惜春两个来了；迎春身上不耐烦，不吃饭；那黛玉是不消说，十顿饭只好吃五顿，众人也不着意了。\n　　少顷饭至，众人调放了桌子。凤姐儿用手巾裹了一把牙箸，站在地下，笑道：“老祖宗和姨妈不用让，还听我说就是了。”贾母笑向薛姨妈道：“我们就是这样。”薛姨妈笑着应了。于是凤姐放下四双箸：上面两双是贾母、薛姨妈，两边是宝钗湘云的。王夫人、李宫裁等都站在地下，看着放菜。凤姐先忙着要干净家伙来，替宝玉拣菜。少顷，莲叶汤来了，贾母看过了，王夫人回头见玉钏儿在那里，便命玉钏儿与宝玉送去。凤姐道：“他一个人难拿。”可巧莺儿和同喜都来了，宝钗知道他们已吃了饭，便向莺儿道：“宝二爷正叫你去打绦子，你们两个同去罢。”莺儿答应着，和玉钏儿出来。莺儿道：“这么远，怪热的，那可怎么端呢？”玉钏儿笑道：“你放心，我自有道理。”说着，便命一个婆子来，将汤饭等类放在一个捧盒里，命他端了跟着，他两个却空着手走。一直到了怡红院门口，玉钏儿方接过来了，同着莺儿进入房中。\n　　袭人、麝月、秋纹三个人正和宝玉玩笑呢，见他两个来了，都忙起来笑道：“你们两个来的怎么碰巧，一齐来了。”一面说，一面接过来。玉钏儿便向一张杌子上坐下，莺儿不敢坐，袭人便忙端了个脚踏来，莺儿还不敢坐。宝玉见莺儿来了，却倒十分欢喜。见了玉钏儿，便想起他姐姐金钏儿来了，又是伤心，又是惭愧，便把莺儿丢下，且和玉钏儿说话。袭人见把莺儿不理，恐莺儿没好意思的，又见莺儿不肯坐，便拉了莺儿出来，到那边屋里去吃茶说话儿去了。\n　　这里麝月等预备了碗箸来伺候吃饭。宝玉只是不吃，问玉钏儿道：“你母亲身上好？”玉钏儿满脸娇嗔，正眼也不看宝玉，半日方说了一个“好”字。宝玉便觉没趣，半日，只得又陪笑问道：“谁叫你替我送来的？”玉钏儿道：“不过是奶奶太太们！”宝玉见他还是哭丧着脸，便知他是为金钏儿的原故。待要虚心下气哄他，又见人多，不好下气的，因而便寻方法将人都支出去，然后又陪笑问长问短。那玉钏儿先虽不欲理他，只管见宝玉一些性气也没有，凭他怎么丧谤，还是温存和气，自己倒不好意思的了，脸上方有三分喜色。宝玉便笑央道：“好姐姐，你把那汤端了来，我尝尝。”玉钏儿道：“我从不会喂人东西，等他们来了再喝。”宝玉笑道：“我不是要你喂我，我因为走不动，你递给我喝了，你好赶早回去交代了，好吃饭去。我只管耽误了时候，岂不饿坏了你。你要懒怠动，我少不得忍着疼下去取去。”说着，便要下床，扎挣起来，禁不住“嗳哟”之声。玉钏儿见他这般，也忍不过，起身说道：“躺下去罢！那世里造的孽，这会子现世现报，叫我那一个眼睛瞧的上！”一面说，一面哧的一声又笑了，端过汤来。宝玉笑道：“好姐姐你要生气，只管在这里生罢，见了老太太、太太，可和气着些。若还这样，你就要挨骂了。”玉钏儿道：“吃罢，吃罢！你不用和我甜嘴蜜舌的了，我都知道啊！”说着，催宝玉喝了两口汤。宝玉故意说不好吃。玉钏儿撇嘴道：“阿弥陀佛！这个还不好吃，也不知什么好吃呢！”宝玉道：“一点味儿也没有，你不信尝一尝就知道了。”玉钏儿果真赌气尝了一尝。宝玉笑道：“这可好吃了！”玉钏儿听说，方解过他的意思来，原是宝玉哄他喝一口，便说道：“你即说不喝，这会子说好吃，也不给你喝了。”宝玉只管陪笑央求要喝，玉钏儿又不给他，一面又叫人打发吃饭。\n　　丫头方进来时，忽有人来回话，说：“傅二爷家的两个嬷嬷来请安，来见二爷。”宝玉听说，便知是通判傅试家的嬷嬷来了。那傅试原是贾政的门生，原来都赖贾家的名声得意，贾政也着实看待，与别的门生不同；他那里常遣人来走动。宝玉素昔最厌勇男蠢妇的，今日却如何又命这两个婆子进来？其中原来有个原故。只因那宝玉闻得傅试有个妹子，名唤傅秋芳，也是个琼闺秀玉，常听人说才貌俱全，虽自未亲睹，然遐思遥爱之心十分诚敬。不命他们进来，恐薄了傅秋芳，因此连忙命让进来。那傅试原是暴发的，因傅秋芳有几分姿色，聪明过人，那傅试安心仗着妹子，要与豪门贵族结亲，不肯轻意许人，所以耽误到如今。目今傅秋芳已二十三岁，尚未许人。怎奈那些豪门贵族又嫌他本是穷酸，根基浅薄，不肯求配。那傅试与贾家亲密，也自有一段心事。\n　　今日遣来的两个婆子，偏偏是极无知识的，闻得宝玉要见，进来只刚问了好，说了没两句话。那玉钏儿见生人来，也不和宝玉厮闹了，手里端着汤，却只顾听。宝玉又只顾和婆子说话，一面吃饭，伸手去要汤，两个人的眼睛都看着人，不想伸猛了手，便将碗撞翻，将汤泼了宝玉手上。玉钏儿倒不曾烫着，吓了一跳，忙笑道：“这是怎么了？”慌的丫头们忙上来接碗。宝玉自己烫了手，倒不觉的，只管问玉钏儿：“烫了那里了？疼不疼？”玉钏儿和众人都笑了。玉钏儿道：“你自己烫了，只管问我。”宝玉听了，方觉自己烫了。众人上来，连忙收拾。宝玉也不吃饭了，洗手吃茶，又和那两个婆子说了两句话，然后两个婆子告辞出去。睛雯等送至桥边方回。\n　　那两个婆子见没人了，一行走一行谈论。这一个笑道：“怪道有人说他们家的宝玉是相貌好里头糊涂，中看不中吃，果然竟有些呆气。他自己烫了手，倒问别人疼不疼，这可不是呆了吗！”那个又笑道：“我前一回来，还听见他家里许多人说，千真万真有些呆气。大雨淋的水鸡儿似的，他反告诉别人，‘下雨了，快避雨去罢。’你说可笑不可笑。时常没人在跟前，就自哭自笑的，看见燕子就和燕子说话，河里看见了鱼就和鱼儿说话，见了星星月亮，他不是长吁短叹的，就是咕咕哝哝的。且一点刚性儿也没有，连那些毛丫头的气都受到了。爱惜起东西来，连个线头儿都是好的；遭塌起来，那怕值千值万都不管了。”两个人一面说，一面走出园来回去，不在话下。\n　　且说袭人见人去了，便携了莺儿过来问宝玉：“打什么绦子？”宝玉笑向莺儿道：“才只顾说话，就忘了你了。烦你来不为别的，替我打几根络子。”莺儿道：“装什么的络子？”宝玉见问，便笑道：“不管装什么的，你都每样打几个罢。”莺儿拍手笑道：“这还了得，要这样，十年也打不完了。”宝玉笑道：“好姑娘，你闲着也没事，都替我打了罢。”袭人笑道：“那里一时都打的完？如今先拣要紧的打几个罢。”莺儿道：“什么要紧，不过是扇子，香坠儿，汗巾子。”宝玉道：“汗巾子就好。”莺儿道：“汗巾子是什么颜色？”宝玉道：“大红的。”莺儿道：“大红的须是黑络子才好看，或是石青的，才压得住颜色。”\n宝玉道：“松花色配什么？”莺儿道：“松花配桃红。”宝玉笑道：“这才娇艳。再要雅淡之中带些娇艳。”莺儿道：“葱绿柳黄可倒还雅致。”宝玉道：“也罢了。也打一条桃红，再打一条葱绿。”莺儿道：“什么花样呢？”宝玉道：“也有几样花样？”莺儿道：“一炷香”，“朝天凳”，“象眼块”、“方胜”、“连环”、“梅花”、“柳叶”。”宝玉道：“前儿你替三姑娘打的那花样是什么？”莺儿道：“是“攒心梅花”。”宝玉道：“就是那样好。”一面说，一面袭人刚拿了线来。窗外婆子说：“姑娘们的饭都有了。”宝玉道：“你们吃饭去，快吃了来罢。”袭人笑道：“有客在这里。我们怎么好意思去呢？”莺儿一面理线，一面笑道：“这打那里说起？正经快吃去罢。”袭人等听说，方去了，只留下两个小丫头呼唤。\n　　宝玉一面看莺儿打络子，一面说闲话。因问他：“十几岁了？”莺儿手里打着，一面答话：“十五岁了。”宝玉道：“你本姓什么？”莺儿道：“姓黄。”宝玉笑道：“这个姓名倒对了，果然是个‘黄莺儿’。”莺儿笑道：“我的名字本来是两个字，叫做金莺，姑娘嫌拗口，只单叫莺儿，如今就叫开了。”宝玉道：“宝姐姐也就算疼你了。明儿宝姐姐出嫁，少不得是你跟了去了。”莺儿抿嘴一笑。宝玉笑道：“我常常和你花大姐姐说，明儿也不知那一个有造化的消受你们主儿两个呢。”莺儿笑道：“你还不知我们姑娘，有几样世上的人没有的好处呢，模样儿还在其次。”宝玉见莺儿娇腔婉转，语笑如痴，早不胜其情了，那堪更提起宝钗来？便问道：“什么好处？你细细儿的告诉我听。”莺儿道：“我告诉你，你可不许告诉他。”宝玉笑道：“这个自然。”\n　　正说着，只听见外头说道：“怎么这么静悄悄的？”二人回头看时，不是别人，正是宝钗来了。宝玉忙让坐。宝钗坐下，因问莺儿：“打什么呢？”一面问，一面向他手里去瞧，才打了半截儿。宝钗笑道：“这有什么趣儿，倒不如打个络子把玉络上呢。”一句话提醒了宝玉，便拍手笑道：“倒是姐姐说的是，我就忘了。只是配个什么颜色才好？”宝钗道：“用鸦色断然使不得，大红又犯了色。黄的又不起眼，黑的太暗。依我说，竟把你的金线拿来配着黑珠儿线，一根一根的拈上，打成络子，那才好看。”宝玉听说，喜之不尽，一叠连声就叫袭人来取金线。\n　　正值袭人端了两碗菜走进来，告诉宝玉道：“今儿奇怪，刚才太太打发人给我送了两碗菜来。”宝玉笑道：“必定是今儿菜多，送给你们大家吃的。”袭人道：“不是，说指名给我的，还不叫过去磕头，这可是奇了。”宝钗笑道：“给你的你就吃去，这有什么猜疑的。”袭人道：“从来没有的事，倒叫我不好意思的。”宝钗抿嘴一笑，说道：“这就不好意思了？明儿还有比这个更叫你不好意思的呢！”袭人听了话内有因，素知宝钗不是轻嘴薄舌莫落人的，自己想起上日王夫人的意思来，便不再提了。将菜给宝玉看了，说：“洗了手来拿线。”说毕，便一直出去了。吃过饭，洗了手进来，拿金线给莺儿打络子。此时宝钗早被薛蟠遣人来请出去了。\n这里宝玉正看着打络子，忽见邢夫人那边遣了两个丫头送了两样果子来给他吃，问他：“可走得了么？要走的动，叫哥儿明儿过去散散心，太太着实惦记着呢。”宝玉忙道：“要走得了，必定过来请太太的安去。疼的比先好些，请太太放心罢。”一面叫他两个坐下，一面又叫：“秋纹，来把才那果子拿一半送给林姑娘去。”秋纹答应了，刚欲去时，只听黛玉在院内说话，宝玉忙叫快请。\n要知端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "Baochai had obviously heard Daiyu’s gibe, but thinking of her mother and brother she walked on without turning her head.\n\nDaiyu remained standing in the shade of the blossom, staring towards Happy Red Court. She saw Li Wan, Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun with their maids leave one after another, but there was no sign of Xifeng. This set her wondering.\n\n“Why hasn’t she come to see Baoyu?” she mused. “Even if she’s busy, she should put in an appearance to please the old lady and Lady Wang. There must be some reason why she hasn’t turned up yet.”\n\nWhile puzzling over this she looked up and saw a crowd of people surging into the courtyard. The old lady was leaning on Xifeng’s arm, followed by Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Concubine Zhou and a bevy of maids and serving-women. The sight reminded Daiyu with a pang how nice it was to have parents, and soon her face was bathed in tears. Then she saw Aunt Xue and Baochai go in.\n\nSuddenly Zijuan came up behind her. “Do come and take your medicine, miss,” she urged. “The boiled water will be cold.”\n\n“What business is it of yours whether I take my medicine or not?” Daiyu flared up. “Why should you keep nagging?”\n\n“You’ve only just stopped coughing,” protested Zijuan. “Why will you refuse your medicine? Even though it’s May and the weather’s warm, you must be careful. You’ve been standing a long time on this damp ground; it’s time to go back and rest.”\n\nOnly then did Daiyu become conscious of a numbness in her legs. After standing there a little longer she leaned on Zijuan and slowly returned to Bamboo Lodge. As she entered the gate she saw the shadows of bamboos on the ground and the moss in dappled light and shade, which reminded her of two lines from The Western Chamber:\n\nIn this secluded spot far from the world’s ado\nThe moss is paved with white drops that like dew look.\n\n“Though Shuang-wen was unlucky, at least she had a widowed mother and a young brother,” Daiyu reflected with a sigh. “But I’ve neither parents nor siblings, no one but myself....” She was on the point of tears again when, with a squawk, the parrot on the verandah perch flapped its wings, startling her.\n\n“You’re asking for trouble,” she scolded. “Flinging dust all over me.”\n\nThe parrot flew back to its perch and cried, “Xueyan, raise the curtain. Your young mistress is here.”\n\nDaiyu halted and tapped the perch. “Have you had your water?” she asked.\n\nThe parrot sighed like a human being and started to recite:\n\n“People laugh at me for burying fallen blossoms,\nBut who will bury me when dead I lie?\nSee, when spring draws to a close and flowers bloom,\nOne by one they fall — to what fate who can tell?”\n\nDaiyu and Zijuan laughed.\n\n“That’s one of your young mistress’s favourite poems,” said Zijuan. “How did he learn it?”\n\nDaiyu told her to take the perch down and hang it outside the moon-gate. Then she went in and sat by the moon-window to take her medicine. The bamboos outside cast a green shadow on the gauze of the window, making the room dark and cool and the mat on the couch feel chilly. To while away the time she teased the parrot through the window, teaching it to recite some of the poems she liked. But no more of this.\n\nWhen Baochai reached home her mother was doing her hair.\n\n“You’ve dressed your hair early,” she remarked with a smile at sight of her daughter.\n\n“I came to see how you were, mother,” said Baochai, sitting down beside her. “Did he make a scene again after I left yesterday?”\n\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth before she burst out crying.\n\nThis started her mother crying too. “Don’t be upset, child,” she soothed.\n\n“You wretch! If anything should happen to you, what use would my life be to me?”\n\nHearing this from outside, Xue Pan hurried in and with a bow to his sister, right and left, pleaded, “Forgive me this time, dear sister! It was the wine I drank yesterday that made me so late coming home. I must have run into some evil spirit on the way back. I was still under its influence when I got home and didn’t know what nonsense I was talking. No wonder you were angry.”\n\nBaochai, who had been covering her face to weep, could not help smiling at this. She looked up and spat in disgust.\n\n“Stop playing the fool,” she cried. “I know you find us a burden, mother and me. You’re trying all you can think of to get rid of us so that you can have a clear conscience.”\n\nXue Pan promptly grinned.\n\n“Whatever makes you say such a thing, sister?” he protested. “You’ve never been one to take offence or talk like that before.”\n\n“You only listen to your sister’s ‘wild talk’,” put in Aunt Xue. “But was what you said last night permissible? You must have taken leave of your senses.”\n\n“Don’t be angry, mother, and don’t you worry, sister,” he said. “From now on I’ll never drink with those fellows again. Will that do?”\n\n“So you’ve come to your senses at last,” Baochai smiled.\n\n“If you’re really going to show some strength of character, dragons will lay eggs,” scoffed his mother.\n\n“If I drink with them again, sister can spit in my face and call me a beast, a degenerate. Is that fair? Why should I make the two of you worry day after day? If mother gets angry, that’s bad enough; but if I make sister worry too, I’m worse than a beast. Now that our father’s dead, instead of looking after mother properly and being kind to my sister, I upset both of you — why, I’m not even human!” As he was speaking the tears ran down his cheeks.\n\nAunt Xue had stopped crying, but this reduced her to tears again.\n\nBaochai, forcing a smile, said, “Having made enough trouble, are you now trying to make mother cry again?”\n\n“Me make mother cry?” He hastily wiped his eyes and grinned. “I would never do such a thing. All right, all right, let’s say no more about it. We’ll send for Xiangling to make sister some tea.”\n\n“I don’t want any tea. As soon as mother has washed we’re going back.”\n\n“Let me have a look at your necklet, sister. It may need fresh gilding.”\n\n“It’s still as good as gold. What would be the point of that?”\n\n“You ought to have some new clothes made. What colours and patterns would you like? Just tell me.”\n\n“I haven’t worn all the clothes I have. Why should I want any more?”\n\nBy now Aunt Xue had changed her clothes and she led Baochai away, leaving Xue Pan to go out by himself.\n\nAunt Xue and her daughter went to the Garden to see Baoyu. As they approached Happy Red Court, the many matrons and maids on the verandahs of the main lodge and the side apartments made it clear that the Lady Dowager was there. Mother and daughter went in and greeted the whole company. They saw Baoyu reclining on the couch.\n\n“Are you better?” asked Aunt Xue.\n\nHe made as if to rise and assured her that he was.\n\n“I’m sorry to have put you and my cousin to so much trouble,” he added.\n\nAunt Xue made him lie down again.\n\n“If you think of anything you’d like, just let me know,” she said.\n\n“If I do, I shall ask you for it,” he replied with a smile.\n\n“What would you like to eat?” asked Lady Wang. “I’ll have it sent to you later.”\n\n“I don’t feel like eating anything,” he said. “But I wouldn’t mind some of that soup made with small lotus leaves and lotus pods.”\n\n“Just listen to him!” Xifeng laughed. “Nothing but the most choice delicacies will do.”\n\n“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” exclaimed the Lady Dowager. “What a fuss to make about a little thing like that!” She at once ordered the molds to be fetched.\n\n“Don’t be so impatient, Old Ancestress,” said Xifeng with a smile. “Let me think who has charge of them.” She turned to order an old serving-woman to ask the kitchen for them, but after some time the woman came back to report.\n\n“The kitchen staff say they handed in all four of their molds some time ago.”\n\nXifeng thought this over, then said, “Yes, I remember now. They were handed in, but I’ve no idea who took them. Most likely they’re in the tea-kitchen.” She sent to ask there, but they had not been seen either. Finally the molds were produced by the servants in charge of the gold and silver.\n\nAunt Xue was the first to examine them. They were in a small casket, four silver molds each more than a foot long and an inch square, with designs the size of a bean — chrysanthemums, plum-blossom, lotus seed-pods and caltrops, thirty or forty different patterns in all, exquisitely carved.\n\n“What ingenious ideas you have in this household!” she cried, turning to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang. “Fancy having different molds for congee! If no one had told me, I’d never have guessed what they were for.”\n\nWithout waiting for any comment Xifeng answered, “Aunt, you may not know, but this was thought up when we were preparing for the Imperial Visitation. They wanted to use some sort of dough pressed into these molds to borrow the fragrance of fresh lotus leaves, and a good stock is needed too. But I didn’t think the result anything special. Who’d want to eat it often? We just made some that once to try out. I wonder who’s remembered it now.”\n\nShe passed the casket to a servant and ordered the kitchen to prepare at once a dozen kinds of soup with chicken and other ingredients.\n\n“What do you want so many for?” asked Lady Wang.\n\n“There’s a reason,” Xifeng explained. “This isn’t a usual dish. Now that Cousin Bao has asked for it, if we just make some for him and don’t give any to the old lady, aunt and you, madam, that wouldn’t look right. Why not take this chance to make some for all of us? Then I can have a taste too.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager laughed.\n\n“You monkey! How considerate you make out — spending public funds to play the hostess.”\n\nEveryone laughed at that.\n\n“That’s nothing,” Xifeng promptly responded. “I can afford this little treat.” She turned to the servant. “Tell the kitchen to do their best and charge it to my account.”\n\nThe woman assented and went off.\n\n“Since coming here these last few years,” put in Baochai, “I’ve been carefully watching and it seems to me, in spite of all Second Cousin’s cleverness, she can’t compare with the old lady.”\n\n“My child,” rejoined the Lady Dowager, “I’m an old woman now. What cleverness can I have? When I was Xifeng’s age, I was much more capable than she is. For all she’s not up to me, she’s not bad — much better than your aunt, poor thing. She’s so quiet people take her for a simpleton. She doesn’t try to please her parents-in-law, whereas Xifeng’s such a glib talker, no wonder people are fond of her.”\n\n“Does that mean quiet people aren’t liked?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“Quiet people have their good points too, just as glib ones can be tiresome,” replied his grandmother. “It’s better to say too little than too much.”\n\n“In that case, why are you just as fond of my elder sister-in-law, who doesn’t say much, as of Xifeng? And if only talkative people are liked, of all my sisters here you should only be fond of Xifeng and Cousin Lin.”\n\n“As for the girls,” said the Lady Dowager, “I’m not flattering your mother, aunt, but in all truth none of the four girls in our family can compare with Baochai.”\n\nHearing this, Aunt Xue promptly protested, “You are partial, madam.”\n\n\"It was the old lady who got hold of the wrong end of the stick.\" Lady Wang promptly put in with a smile, \"The old lady's often told me in private how good Baochai is, and she meant it.\" Baoyu had turned to his grandmother hoping that she would praise Daiyu; he had not expected her to praise Baochai instead. This was a pleasant surprise, and he smiled at Baochai, who had turned away to talk to Xiren.\n\nJust then they were summoned to a meal. The Lady Dowager rose and told Baoyu to have a good rest. After giving the maids some further instructions she leaned on Xifeng's arm and, urging Aunt Xue to precede her, led the way out. She asked whether the soup was ready and what Aunt Xue and the others fancied to eat.\n\n\"Just tell me,\" she said, \"and I'll make Xifeng prepare it for us.\"\n\n\"You're making fun of her, madam,\" replied Aunt Xue. \"She often prepares things for you, but you don't eat much.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, aunt,\" protested Xifeng. \"Our Old Ancestress would have gobbled me up long ago if she weren't afraid that human flesh is sour.\"\n\nThis set the whole party laughing, even Baoyu in his room. Xiren chuckled.\n\n\"The second young mistress does have a terrifyingly sharp tongue,\" she remarked.\n\nBaoyu took her hand and said, \"You've been standing there all this time. You must be tired.\" As he spoke he made her sit down beside him.\n\n\"You're forgetting again,\" she told him. \"While Miss Baochai's still in the courtyard, you should ask her to send Yinger over to plait some cords for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm glad you reminded me.\" He craned his head out of the window.\n\n\"After your meal, cousin, will you ask Yinger to come and plait some cords for me?\" he called. \"Will she have time?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered Baochai over her shoulder. \"I'll send her presently.\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the others, who had not caught what was said, stopped to ask Baochai and were told.\n\n\"Ask her to plait some for your cousin, dear child,\" said the old lady. \"If you need anyone to help, I have plenty of idle girls. Just choose whichever you like to wait on you.\"\n\n\"We'll send her to do it,\" Aunt Xue and Baochai replied. \"What does she have to do anyway? She just romps about all day.\"\n\nAs they walked on they saw Xiangyun, Pinger and Xiangling picking balsam by some rocks. The girls came forward to greet them.\n\nOnce outside the Garden, Lady Wang was for taking the Lady Dowager to her own apartments to rest, and the old lady, whose feet were aching, nodded in agreement. Lady Wang told the maids to go on ahead to prepare. And since Concubine Zhao had pleaded illness, only Concubine Zhou with some old nannies and maids raised the portiere, set out back-rests and spread cushions. The Lady Dowager, leaning on Xifeng, entered and took the seat of honour, urging Aunt Xue to take the other. Baochai and Xiangyun sat below. Lady Wang served the old lady with tea while Li Wan served Aunt Xue.\n\n\"Let the young people wait on us,\" said the Lady Dowager. \"Sit down so that we can have a chat.\"\n\nLady Wang sat on a small stool and told Xifeng to put a table there for the old lady's meal, then send for more dishes. Xifeng assented and went out to give the order to the servants in the old lady's apartments. The matrons there at once passed on the word and the maids hurried over. Lady Wang also sent to invite the young ladies. But after some time only Tanchun and Xichun arrived. Yingchun, not feeling well, had not come; and as for Daiyu, it went without saying that she only ate one meal in two, so no one paid any attention to her absence.\n\nSoon the meal was served and the table laid. Xifeng put out chopsticks wrapped in a napkin.\n\nShe stood on the floor to say gaily, “Don’t keep pressing other people to eat, Old Ancestress and Aunt Xue. Just listen to me.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager told Aunt Xue with a smile, “That’s the way we are.”\n\nAunt Xue cheerfully agreed.\n\nThen Xifeng set down four pairs of chopsticks. The two upper places were for the Lady Dowager and Aunt Xue, the two at the side for Baochai and Xiangyun. Lady Wang, Li Wan and the others stood on the floor watching the dishes being served. Xifeng first called for clean bowls and chose dishes for Baoyu. Soon the lotus-leaf soup arrived. The Lady Dowager inspected it, and Lady Wang, turning round and seeing Yuchuan there, told her to take it to Baoyu.\n\n“She can’t carry all that by herself,” objected Xifeng.\n\nJust then Ying’er and Tongxi arrived. Knowing that they had already eaten, Baochai said to Ying’er, “Master Bao was asking for you to make him some cords. You can both go together.”\n\nYing’er assented and went out with Yuchuan.\n\n“It’s such a long way and so hot,” she said. “How are we going to carry it?”\n\n“Don’t worry,” replied Yuchuan. “I know what to do.”\n\nShe ordered an old servant to put the soup and other dishes in a hamper and carry it, following them as they walked on empty-handed. Not till they reached the gate of Happy Red Court did Yuchuan take the hamper, and she went in with Ying’er.\n\nXiren, Sheyue and Qiuwen were amusing Baoyu. At sight of the two other girls they stood up to greet them.\n\n“What a coincidence your coming together!” they cried, taking the hamper.\n\nYuchuan sat down on a stool, but Ying’er, not venturing to sit, was at once offered a footstool by Xiren. Even then she declined to sit down. Baoyu was delighted to see Ying’er, but the sight of Yuchuan reminded him of her sister Jinchuan and he felt both upset and ashamed. So he ignored Ying’er and chatted with Yuchuan instead. Xiren, not wanting Ying’er to feel left out of it and seeing her reluctance to sit down, led her off to the next room for some tea and a chat.\n\nMeanwhile Sheyue and the others had prepared bowls and chopsticks and were waiting on Baoyu. But he refused to eat.\n\n“Is your mother well?” he asked Yuchuan.\n\nPouting, she kept her eyes averted and after a long pause she answered, “Yes.”\n\nBaoyu felt rather snubbed. After a pause he asked with a conciliatory smile, “Who told you to bring this over?”\n\n“The mistresses.”\n\nHer woebegone expression told him that she was still grieving for her sister. He would have liked to coax her into a better mood, but with so many maids present he could hardly humble himself. He was trying to think of a way to send them away when Yuchuan, though she had seemed determined to ignore him, was disarmed by his good nature. For no matter how rude she was, he remained so gentle and pleasant that she felt ashamed of herself and began to look more cheerful.\n\n“Dear sister!” he then pleaded. “Bring me that soup to taste.”\n\n“I’ve never fed anyone. Wait till the others come back.”\n\n“I’m not asking you to feed me. I can’t move, but if you’ll just pass it to me I can drink it, then you can go back early to report and have your meal. If I keep you here too long, you’ll get hungry. If you can’t be bothered, I’ll just have to put up with the pain and fetch it myself.”\n\nAs he made to get down from the bed he could not help crying out, “Ai-yo!” This so upset Yuchuan that she rose to her feet.\n\n“Lie down!” she scolded. “What sins you committed in your last incarnation are being paid back now! How can I bear to watch?”\n\nShe snorted, then burst out laughing.\n\nHanding him the soup, Yuchuan had come back. Baoyu smiled.\n\n“Dear sister, if you want to be angry, please be angry here; but when you see the old lady and my mother do try to look a little more pleasant. If you pull such a long face there, you’ll get a scolding.”\n\n“Come on, drink your soup. None of your sweet talk! I know you.”\n\nShe made him take a couple of mouthfuls then, but he deliberately said it did not taste good.\n\n“Gracious Buddha!” she cried. “If this is no good, what do you call good?”\n\n“It’s quite tasteless. Have a taste yourself if you don’t believe me.”\n\nIn exasperation she did so.\n\n“Now it’s good,” he chuckled.\n\nOnly then did she catch on that he had tricked her into tasting it.\n\n“You said you didn’t want it,” she retorted. “Now you say it’s good, but you shan’t have any.”\n\nShe refused to give him any more, and he had to plead with her smilingly until she relented. She was just urging him to take it when a maid announced that two nurses from Second Master Fu’s house had come to pay their respects and see Baoyu.\n\nHe knew that these were the nurses of Fu Shih, the assistant prefect. Fu Shih was a protege of his father’s who had made good by trading on the Jia family’s reputation; and because Jia Zheng thought highly of him, unlike his other proteges, he often sent servants over with gifts. Now Baoyu had always had a contempt for officious men and stupid women, so why did he ask these two nurses in? There was a reason. He had heard that Fu Shih had a younger sister called Fu Qiufang who was said to be both beautiful and talented. Although he had never seen her, he felt a most devout admiration for her from afar. Not to receive these nurses, he thought, might seem a slight to Fu Qiufang; so he promptly ordered them to be admitted.\n\nFu Shih was an upstart. Because his sister was quite pretty and exceptionally clever, he was counting on her to make a good match for him and was unwilling to marry her to just anybody; so here she was, already twenty-three and still not engaged. The noble and rich families he had in mind, however, despised him as a poverty-stricken upstart without background, and would not propose a match. This was why Fu Shih cultivated the Jias, having certain plans in mind.\n\nThe two nurses who came today were extremely ignorant. Having paid their respects to Baoyu they had little to say. The arrival of these strangers made Yuchuan stop teasing Baoyu, and she stood there listening with the soup in her hands while he chatted with the nurses as he ate. Reaching out for the soup, as both were looking at the nurses his hand moved too far and knocked the bowl over, spilling the soup all over his hand. Yuchuan, although not scalded, gave a cry of dismay.\n\n“Now what’s the matter?” she exclaimed.\n\nThe maids hurried forward to take the bowl. Baoyu, too engrossed to feel any pain himself, asked Yuchuan:\n\n“Did it scald you? Does it hurt?”\n\nShe and all the maids had to smile at that.\n\n“You’re the one who’s scalded, yet you ask me,” she retorted.\n\nOnly then did Baoyu realize that he had been burned.\n\nThe servants made haste to clear up the mess. He stopped eating to wash his hands and drink some tea, then chatted a little longer with the two nurses before they took their leave. Qingwen and the other girls saw them out as far as the bridge.\n\nOnce by themselves, the two nurses started chatting as they walked.\n\n“No wonder some people say the Baoyu in their house may be good-looking but he’s a simpleton inside,” said one. “He certainly is a bit touched. Fancy not feeling it when he burns himself, and asking someone else whether it hurts! Isn’t that being silly?”\n\n“The last time I came,” said the other,\n\nI heard her maids say she’s really a simpleton. She’ll let the rain pour down on her till she’s drenched as a drowned rat, then tell other people to run for shelter from the rain. Isn’t that ridiculous? Often she mopes all alone or laughs to herself for no reason. When she sees swallows she talks to them, when she sees fish in the stream she talks to them, and when she sees the moon or stars she either sighs or mutters away to herself. She hasn’t a spark of spirit. She lets even the maids push her around. She’s so careful of her things that not a thread will she waste; yet she doesn’t care if things worth thousands are spoilt.”\n\nAs they talked the two of them left the Garden and went their different ways.\n\nBut let us return to Xiren. After the others had gone she brought Yinger over and asked Baoyu, “What sort of braid do you want?”\n\n“I was so busy talking, I forgot all about you,” he told Yinger with a smile. “I’ve asked you here for one thing only: to make some cords for me.”\n\n“What sort of cords for what?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter. Just make me some of each kind.”\n\nYinger clapped her hands and laughed.\n\n“That would take ten years!” she cried.\n\n“You’ve time on your hands, my dear,” said Baoyu. “Do them for me, please.”\n\n“We’d have to get more help first,” Xiren told him with a smile. “You’d better choose the most urgent ones for her to start with.”\n\n“What’s ‘urgent’?” asked Yinger. “Fans, scent-bags and handkerchiefs, I suppose.”\n\n“Handkerchiefs would do,” said Baoyu.\n\n“What colour?”\n\n“Scarlet.”\n\n“Scarlet looks best with black or dark blue. Any other colour wouldn’t set it off so well.”\n\n“What would go well with pale pink?”\n\n“Pale pink with peach-red.”\n\n“That sounds rather gaudy. Still, it would be nice to have something rather striking in a quiet way.”\n\n“Willow-green and light yellow are rather quiet and pleasing.”\n\n“All right then,” said Baoyu. “Get one done in peach-red and one in light green.”\n\n“What designs would you like?”\n\n“How many designs are there?”\n\nYinger counted them off on her fingers.\n\n“There are ‘the hall of fame,’ ‘the chariot-cover,’ ‘the signboard,’ ‘the interlocking squares,’ ‘the chain,’ ‘plum-blossom,’ and ‘willow-leaves.’”\n\n“What was the design you made for Miss Tanchun the other day?”\n\n“‘Plum-blossom in the heart.’”\n\n“Yes, that was good.”\n\nAs Baoyu said this Xiren came back with the silk.\n\nAn old woman outside the window called, “The young ladies’ meal is ready.”\n\n“You two go and have your meal,” said Baoyu. “Come back as soon as you’ve finished.”\n\nXiren smiled.\n\n“How can we go, with a guest here?”\n\nYinger, smoothing the silk, said, “What way is that to talk? Of course you must go. Don’t mind me.”\n\nSo Xiren and the others left, leaving only two young maids to answer any calls.\n\nAs Yinger worked, Baoyu chatted with her.\n\n“How old are you?” he asked.\n\n“Sixteen,” she replied, her hands busy.\n\n“What’s your family name?”\n\n“Huang.”\n\n“That’s just right,” he joked. “A ‘yellow oriole’ should be called Huang.”\n\n“My name was Jin-ying at first,” she told him. “But my young mistress found that awkward, so she just called me Yinger, and now that’s the name everyone uses.”\n\n“I’m sure Cousin Baochai is very good to you. When she marries, she’s bound to take you along with her.”\n\nYinger giggled.\n\n“I’ve often told Sister Xiren,” Baoyu went on with a smile,\n\n“I wonder who’ll have the good fortune to marry you and your young lady,” he said.\n\nYing’er giggled. “You don’t know yet all my young lady’s wonderful qualities. Her good looks are the least of them.”\n\nBaoyu was already bewitched by Ying’er’s charming ways and entrancing smile. The mention of Baochai made him even more eager to hear what she had to say.\n\n“What wonderful qualities?” he asked. “Do tell me in detail.”\n\n“I’ll tell you if you promise not to pass it on to her.”\n\n“Of course not,” he promised.\n\nJust then someone outside said, “Why is it so quiet in here?”\n\nThey turned to see who it was and in walked Baochai. Baoyu at once offered her a seat. She sat down and asked Ying’er what she was making, looking at the work in her hand which was only half done.\n\n“That’s not much fun,” she remarked. “Why not make a cord to net your jade?”\n\nThis reminded Baoyu and he clapped his hands.\n\n“How stupid of me to forget!” he cried. “But what colour would go well with it?”\n\n“It’s no use using black,” said Baochai. “Red would be too gaudy, yellow the wrong shade, and black again too dark. I suggest you take some of your gold thread and twist it with black pearl thread, then work it into a net. That would look well.”\n\nBaoyu was delighted with this idea and called at once for Xiren to fetch the gold thread.\n\nJust then Xiren came in with two dishes of food.\n\n“Something strange happened today,” she told Baoyu. “Her Ladyship sent me these two dishes.”\n\n“I suppose there was more than usual today, so she sent some for all of you to share.”\n\n“No, she sent them specially to me and didn’t ask me to go and kotow to her. Wasn’t that odd?”\n\n“If she gave them to you, just eat them and stop wondering,” advised Baochai.\n\n“But such a thing never happened before. I feel quite embarrassed.”\n\n“What’s so embarrassing about this?” Baochai smiled significantly. “You may have something even more embarrassing tomorrow.”\n\nXiren, recalling Lady Wang’s recent favour and knowing that Baochai was not one to make thoughtless remarks, said no more. She showed the dishes to Baoyu, then said, “I’ll go to fetch the gold thread as soon as I’ve washed my hands.” With that she left.\n\nAfter their meal, when she had washed her hands, she came back with the gold thread for Ying’er to make the net. By now, however, Baochai had been summoned by her brother.\n\nAs Baoyu watched Ying’er at work, two maids sent by Lady Xing brought him two kinds of fruit and asked, “Can you get up now? If you can, the young master is to go over tomorrow for a change. Her Ladyship is most anxious to see you.”\n\n“If I can manage it, I’ll certainly go to pay my respects,” he replied. “I’m much better, thank you. Please ask Her Ladyship not to worry.”\n\nHe invited the two maids to sit down.\n\n“Qiuwen!” he called. “Take half of these fruits to Miss Lin.”\n\nQiuwen assented and was about to do this when they heard Daiyu talking in the courtyard. Baoyu called to her to come in.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
