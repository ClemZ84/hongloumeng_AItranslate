  "original": "话说宝钗听秋纹说袭人不好，连忙进去瞧看，巧姐儿同平儿也随着。走到袭人炕前，只见袭人心痛难禁，一时气厥。宝钗等用开水灌了过来，仍旧扶他睡下，一面传请大夫。巧姐儿因问宝钗道：“袭人姐姐怎么病到这个样儿？”宝钗道：“大前儿晚上哭伤了心了，一时发晕栽倒了。太太叫人扶他回来，他就睡倒了。因外头有事，没有请大夫瞧他，所以致此。”说着，大夫来了，宝钗等略避。大夫看了脉，说是急怒所致，开了方子去了。\n　　原来袭人模糊听见说宝玉若不回来，便要打发屋里的人都出去，一急越发不好了。到大夫瞧后，秋纹给他煎药，他各自一人躺着，神魂未定，好象宝玉在他面前，恍惚又象是见个和尚，手里拿着一本册子揭着看，还说道：“你不是我的人，日后自然有人家儿的。”袭人似要和他说话，秋纹走来说：“药好了，姐姐吃罢。”袭人睁眼一瞧，知是个梦，也不告诉人。吃了药，便自己细细的想：“宝玉必是跟了和尚去。上回他要拿玉出去，便是要脱身的样子。被我揪住，看他竟不象往常，把我混推混搡的，一点情意都没有。后来待二奶奶更生厌烦，在别的妹妹跟前，也是没有一点情意：这就是悟道的样子。但是你悟了道，抛了二奶奶怎么好？我是太太派我服侍你，虽是月钱照着那样的分例，其实我究竟没有在老爷太太跟前回明，就算了你的屋里人。若是老爷太太打发我出去，我若死守着，又叫人笑话；若是我出去，心想宝玉待我的情分，实在不忍。”左思右想，万分难处。想到刚才的梦，“说我是别人的人，那倒不如死了干净。”岂知吃药以后，心痛减了好些，也难躺着，只好勉强支持。\n　　过了几日，起来服侍宝钗。宝钗想念宝玉，暗中垂泪，自叹命苦。又知他母亲打算给哥哥赎罪，很费张罗，不能不帮着打算。暂且不表。\n　　且说贾政扶贾母灵柩，贾蓉送了秦氏、凤姐、鸳鸯的棺木到了金陵，先安了葬。贾蓉自送黛玉的灵，也去安葬。贾政料理坟墓的事。一日，接到家书，一行一行的看到宝玉、贾兰得中，心里自是喜欢；后来看到宝玉走失，复又烦恼。只得赶忙回来。在道儿上又闻得有恩赦的旨意，又接着家书，果然赦罪复职，更是喜欢，便日夜趱行。\n　　一日，行到陵驿地方，那天乍寒，下雪，泊在一个清静去处。贾政打发众人上岸投帖辞谢朋友，总说即刻开船，都不敢劳动。船上只留一个小厮伺候，自己在船中写家书，先要打发人起早到家。写到宝玉的事，便停笔。抬头忽见船头上微微的雪影里面一个人，光着头，赤着脚，身上披着一领大红猩猩毡的斗篷，向贾政倒身下拜。贾政尚未认清，急忙出船，欲待扶住问他是谁。那人已拜了四拜，站起来打了个问讯。贾政才要还揖，迎面一看，不是别人，却是宝玉。贾政吃一大惊，忙问道：“可是宝玉么？”那人只不言语，似喜似悲。贾政又问道：“你若是宝玉，如何这样打扮，跑到这里来？”宝玉未及回言，只见船头上来了两人，一僧一道，夹住宝玉道：“俗缘已毕，还不快走。”说着，三个人飘然登岸而去。贾政不顾地滑，疾忙来赶，见那三人在前，那里赶得上？只听得他们三人口中不知是那个作歌曰：\n　　我所居兮青埂之峰，我所游兮鸿蒙太空。谁与我逝兮吾谁与从？渺渺茫茫今归彼大荒！\n　　贾政一面听着，一面赶去，转过一小坡，倏然不见。贾政已赶得心虚气喘，惊疑不定。回过头来，见自己的小厮也随后赶来，贾政问道：“你看见方才那三个么？”小厮道：“看见的。奴才为老爷追赶，故也赶来。后来只见老爷，不见那三个人了。”贾政还欲前走，只见白茫茫一片旷野，并无一人。贾政知是古怪，只得回来。\n　　众家人回船，见贾政不在舱中，问了船夫，说是老爷上岸追赶两个和尚一个道士去了。众人也从雪地里寻踪迎去，远远见贾政来了，迎上去接着，一同回船。贾政坐下，喘息方定，将见宝玉的话说了一遍。众人回禀，便要在这地方寻觅。贾政叹道：“你们不知道，这是我亲眼见的，并非鬼怪。况听得歌声，大有玄妙。宝玉生下时，衔了玉来，便也古怪，我早知是不祥之兆，为的是老太太疼爱，所以养育到今。便是那和尚道士，我也见了三次：头一次，是那僧道来说玉的好处；第二次，便是宝玉病重，他来了，将那玉持诵了一番，宝玉便好了；第三次，送那玉来，坐在前厅，我一转眼就不见了。我心里便有些诧异，只道宝玉果真有造化，高僧仙道来护佑他的，岂知宝玉是下凡历劫的，竟哄了老太太十九年！如今叫我才明白。”说到那里，掉下泪来。众人道：“宝二爷果然是下凡的和尚，就不该中举人了。怎么中了才去？”贾政道：“你们那里知道？大凡天上星宿，山中老僧，洞里的精灵，他自具一种性情。你看宝玉何尝肯念书？他若略一经心，无有不能的。他那一种脾气，也是各别另样。”说着又叹了几声。众人便拿兰哥得中、家道复兴的话解了一番。贾政仍旧写家书，便把这事写上，劝谕合家不必想念了。写完封好，即着家人回去，贾政随后赶回。暂且不提。\n　　且说薛姨妈得了赦罪的信，便命薛蝌去各处借贷，并自己凑齐了赎罪银两。刑部准了，收兑了银子，一角文书，将薛蟠放出。他们母子妹妹弟兄见面，不必细述，自然是悲喜交集了。薛蟠自己立誓说道：“若是再犯前病，必定犯杀犯剐！”薛姨妈见他这样，便握他的嘴，说：“只要自己拿定主意，必定还要妄口巴舌血淋淋的起这样恶誓么？只是香菱跟你受了多少苦处，你媳妇儿已经自己治死自己了，如今虽说穷了，这碗饭还有得吃，据我的主意，我便算他是媳妇了。你心里怎么样？”薛蟠点头愿意。宝钗等也说：“很该这样。”倒把香菱急得脸胀通红，说是：“伏侍大爷一样的，何必如此？”众人便称起“大奶奶”来，无人不服。\n　　薛蟠便要去拜谢贾家。薛姨妈宝钗也都过来。见了众人，彼此聚首，又说了一番的话。正说着，恰好那日贾政的家人回家，呈上书子，说：“老爷不日到了。”王夫人叫贾兰将书子念给听。贾兰念到贾政亲见宝玉的一段，众人听了，都痛哭起来，王夫人、宝钗、袭人等更甚。大家又将贾政书内叫家内不必悲伤，原是借胎的话解说了一番：“与其作了官，倘或命运不好，犯了事，坏家败产，那时倒不好了。宁可咱们家出一位佛爷，倒是老爷太太的积德，所以才投到咱们家来。不是说句不顾前后的话，当初东府里太爷，倒是修炼了十几年，也没有成了仙，这佛是更难成的。太太这么一想，心里便开豁了。”王夫人哭着和薛姨妈道：“宝玉抛了我，我还恨他呢。我叹的是媳妇的命苦，才成了一二年的亲，怎么他就硬着肠子，都撂下了走了呢！”薛姨妈听了，也甚伤心。\n　　宝钗哭得人事不知。所有爷们都在外头。王夫人便说道：“我为他担了一辈子的惊，刚刚儿的娶了亲，中了举人，又知道媳妇作了胎，我才喜欢些，不想弄到这样结局！早知这样，就不该娶亲，害了人家的姑娘。”薛姨妈道：“这是自己一定的。咱们这样人家，还有什么别的说的吗？幸喜有了胎，将来生个外孙子，必定是有成立的，后来就有了结果了。你看大奶奶，如今兰哥儿中了举人，明年成了进士，可不是就做了官了么？他头里的苦也算吃尽的了，如今的甜来，也是他为人的好处。我们姑娘的心肠儿姐姐是知道的，并不是刻薄轻佻的人，姐姐倒不必耽忧。”王夫人被薛姨妈一番言语说得极有理，心想：“宝钗小时候便是廉静寡欲极爱素淡的，他所以才有这个事。想人生在世，真有个定数的。看着宝钗虽是痛哭，他那端庄样儿一点不走，却倒来劝我，这是真真难得。不想宝玉这样一个人，红尘中福分竟没有一点儿！”想了一回，也觉解了好些。又想到袭人身上：“若说别的丫头呢，没有什么难处的，大的配了出去，小的伏侍二奶奶就是了。独有袭人可怎么处呢？“此时人多也不好说，且等晚上和薛姨妈商量。\n　　那日薛姨妈并未回家，因恐宝钗痛哭，住在宝钗房中解劝。那宝钗却是极明理，思前想后：“宝玉原是一种奇异的人，夙世前因，自有一定，原无可怨天尤人。”更将大道理的话告诉他母亲了。薛姨妈心里反倒安慰，便到王夫人那里，先把宝钗的话说了。王夫人点头叹道：“若说我无德，不该有这样好媳妇了。”说着更又伤心起来。薛姨妈倒又劝了一会子。因又提起袭人来，说：“我见袭人近来瘦的了不得，他是一心想着宝哥儿。但是正配呢理应守的，屋里人愿守也是有的。惟有这袭人，虽说是算个屋里人，到底他和宝哥儿并没有过明路儿的。”王夫人道：“我才刚想着，正要等妹妹商量商量。若说放他出去，恐怕他不愿意，又要寻死觅活的；若要留着他也罢，又恐老爷不依：所以难处。”薛姨妈道：“我看姨老爷是再不肯叫守着的。再者，姨老爷并不知道袭人的事，想来不过是个丫头，那有留的理呢？只要姐姐叫他本家的人来，狠狠的吩咐他，叫他配一门正经亲事，再多多的陪送他些东西。那孩子心肠儿也好，年纪儿又轻，也不枉跟了姐姐会子，也算姐姐待他不薄了。袭人那里，还得我细细劝他。就是叫他家的人来，也不用告诉他；只等他家里果然说定了好人家儿，我们还打听打听，若果然足衣足食，女婿长的象个人儿，然后叫他出去。”王夫人听了，道：“这个主意很是。不然叫老爷冒冒失失的一办，我可不是又害了一个人了么？”薛姨妈听了，点头道：“可不是么？”又说了几句，便辞了王夫人仍到宝钗房中去了。看见袭人泪痕满面，薛姨妈便劝解譬喻了一会。袭人本来老实，不是伶牙俐齿的人，薛姨妈说一句，他应一句，回来说道：“我是做下人的人，姨太太瞧得起我，才和我说这些话。我是从不敢违拗太太的。”薛姨妈听他的话，“好一个柔顺的孩子！”心里更加喜欢。宝钗又将大义的话说了一遍，大家各自相安。\n　　过了几日，贾政回家，众人迎接。贾政见贾赦、贾珍巳都回家，弟兄叔侄相见，大家历叙别来的景况。然后内眷们见了，不免想起宝玉来，又大家伤了一会子心。贾政喝住道：“这是一定的道理！如今只要我们在外把持家事，你们在内相助，断不可仍是从前这样的散漫。别房的事，各有各家料理，也不用承总。我们本房的事，里头全归于你，都要按理而行。”王夫人便将宝钗有孕的话也告诉了，“将来丫头们都放出去。”贾政听了，点头无语。\n　　次日，贾政进内请示大臣们，说是：“蒙恩感激。但未服阙，应该怎么谢恩之处，望乞大人们指教。”众朝臣说是代奏请旨。于是圣恩浩荡，即命陛见。贾政进内谢了恩。圣上又降了好些旨意，又问起宝玉的事来。贾政据实回奏。圣上称奇，旨意说：宝玉的文章固是清奇，想他必是过来人，所以如此，若在朝中，可以进用，他既不敢受圣朝的爵位，便赏了一个“文妙真人”的道号。贾政又叩头谢恩而出。回到家中，贾琏、贾珍接着，贾政将朝内的话述了一遍，众人喜欢。贾珍便回说：“宁国府第，收拾齐全，回明了要搬过去。栊翠庵圈在园内，给四妹妹养静。”贾政并不言语，隔了半日，却吩咐了一番仰报天恩的话。\n　　贾琏也趁便回说：“巧姐亲事，父亲太太都愿意给周家为媳。”贾政昨晚也知巧姐的始末，便说：“大老爷大太太作主就是了。莫说村居不好，只要人家清白，孩子肯念书，能够上进。朝里那些官，难道都是城里的人么？”贾琏答应了“是”，又说：“父亲有了年纪，况且又有痰症的根子，静养几年，诸事原仗二老爷为主。”贾政道：“提起村居养静，甚合我意，只是我受恩深重，尚末酬报耳。”贾政说毕进内，贾琏打发请了刘老老来，应了这件事。刘老老见了王夫人等，便说些将来怎样升官，怎样起家，怎样子孙昌盛。\n　　正说着，丫头回道：“花自芳的女人进来请安。”王夫人问几句话，花自芳的女人将亲戚作媒，说的是城南蒋家的，现在有房有地，又有铺面。姑爷年纪略大几岁，并没有娶过的，况且人物儿长的是百里挑一的。王夫人听了愿意，说道：“你去应了，隔几日进来，再接你妹子罢。”王夫人又命人打听，都说是好。王夫人便告诉了宝钗，仍请了薛姨妈细细的告诉了袭人。袭人悲伤不已，又不敢违命的，心里想起宝玉那年到他家去，回来说的死也不回去的话，“如今太太硬作主张，若说我守着，又叫人说我不害臊；若是去了，实不是我的心愿。”便哭得咽哽难鸣。又被薛姨妈宝钗等苦劝，回过念头想道：“我若是死在这里，倒把太太的好心弄坏了，我该死在家里才是。”于是袭人含悲叫辞了众人。那姐妹分手时，自然更有一番不忍说。\n　　袭人怀着必死的心肠，上车回去，见了哥哥嫂子，也是哭泣，但只说不出来。那花自芳悉把蒋家的聘礼送给他看，又把自己所办妆奁一一指给他瞧，说：“那是太太赏的，那是置办的。”袭人此时更难开口。住了两天，细想起来：“哥哥办事不错。若是死在哥哥家里，岂不又害了哥哥呢？”千思万想，左右为难，真是一缕柔肠，几乎牵断，只得忍住。\n　　那日已是迎娶吉期，袭人本不是那一种泼辣人，委委屈屈的上轿而去，心里另想到那里再作打算。岂知过了门，见那蒋家办事，极其认真，全都按着正配的规矩。一进了门，丫头仆妇，都称“奶奶”。袭人此时欲要死在这里，又恐害了人家，辜负了一番好意。那夜原是哭着不肯俯就的，那姑爷却极柔情曲意的承顺。到了第二天开箱，这姑爷看见一条猩红汗巾，方知是宝玉的丫头。原来当初只知是贾母的侍儿，益想不到是袭人。此时蒋玉函念着宝玉待他的旧情，倒觉满心惶愧，更加周旋；又故意将宝玉所换那条松花绿的汗巾拿出来。袭人看了，方知这姓蒋的原来就是蒋玉函，始信姻缘前定。袭人才将心事说出。蒋玉函也深为叹息敬服，不敢勉强，并越发温柔体贴，弄得个袭人真无死所了。看官听说，虽然事有前定，无可奈何，但孽子孤臣，义夫节妇，这“不得已”三字也不是一概推委得的。此袭人所以在“又副册”也。正是前人过那桃花庙的诗上说道：\n　　千古艰难惟一死，伤心岂独息夫人！\n　　不言袭人从此又是一番天地。且说那贾雨村犯了婪索的案件，审明定罪，今遇大赦，递籍为民。雨村因叫家眷先行，自己带了一个小厮，一车行李，来到急流津觉迷渡口。只见一个道者，从那渡头草棚里出来，执手相迎。雨村认得是甄土隐，也连忙打恭。士隐道：“贾老先生，别来无恙？”雨村道：“老仙长到底是甄老先生！何前次相逢，觌面不认？后知火焚草亭，鄙下深为惶恐。今日幸得相逢，益叹老仙翁道德高深。奈鄙人下愚不移，致有今日。”甄士隐道：“前者老大人高官显爵，贫道怎敢相认？原因故交，敢赠片言，不意老大人相弃之深。然而富贵穷通，亦非偶然，今日复得相逢，也是一桩奇事。这里离草庵不远，暂请膝谈，未知可否？”雨村欣然领命。\n　　两人携手而行，小厮驱车随后，到了一座茅庵。士隐让进，雨村坐下，小童献茶上来。雨村便请教仙长超尘始末。士隐笑道：“一念之间，尘凡顿易。老先生从繁华境中来，岂不知温柔富贵乡中有一宝玉乎？”雨村道：“怎么不知。近闻纷纷传述，说他也遁入空门。下愚当时也曾与他往来过数次，再不想此人竟有如是之决绝。”士隐道：“非也。这一段奇缘，我先知之。昔年我与先生在仁清巷旧宅门口叙话之前，我已会过他一面。”“雨村惊讶道：“京城离贵乡甚远，何以能见？”士隐道：“神交久矣。”雨村道：“既然如此，现今宝玉的下落，仙长定能知之？”士隐道：“宝玉，即‘宝玉’也。那年荣宁查抄之前，钗黛分离之日，此玉早已离世。一为避祸，二为撮合。从此夙缘一了，形质归一。又复稍示神灵，高魁贵子，方显得此玉乃天奇地灵锻炼之宝，非凡间可比。前经茫茫大士渺渺真人携带下凡，如今尘缘已满，仍是此二人携归本处：便是宝玉的下落。”雨村听了，虽不能全然明白，却也十知四五，便点头叹道：“原来如此，下愚不知。但那宝玉既有如此的来历，又何以情迷至此，复又豁悟如此？还要请教。”士隐笑道：“此事说来，先生未必尽解。太虚幻境，既是真如福地。两番阅册，原始要终之道，历历生平，如何不悟？仙草归真，焉有通灵不复原之理呢？”\n　　雨村听着，却不明白，知是仙机，也不便更问。因又说道：“宝玉之事，既得闻命。但敝族闺秀如是之多，何元妃以下，算来结局俱属平常呢？”士隐叹道：“老先生莫怪拙言，贵族之女，俱属从情天孽海而来。大凡古今女子，那‘淫’字固不可犯，只这‘情’字也是沾染不得的。所以崔莺苏小，无非仙子尘心，宋玉相如，大是文人口孽。但凡情思缠绵，那结局就不可问了。”\n　　雨村听到这里，不觉拈须长叹。因又问道：“请教仙翁：那荣宁两府，尚可如前否？”士隐道：“福善祸淫，古今定理。现今荣宁两府，善者修缘，恶者悔祸，将来兰桂齐芳，家道复初，也是自然的道理。”雨村低了半日头，忽然笑道：“是了，是了。现在他府中有一个名兰的，已中乡榜，恰好应着‘兰’宇。适间老仙翁说‘兰桂齐芳’，又道‘宝玉高魁贵子’，莫非他有遗腹之子，可以飞黄腾达的么？”士隐微微笑道：“此系后事，未便预说。”\n　　雨村还要再问，土隐不答，便命人设具盘飧，邀雨村共食。食毕，雨村还要问自己的终身。士隐便道：“老先生草庵暂歇。我还有一段俗缘未了，正当今日完结。”雨村惊讶道：“仙长纯修若此，不知尚有何俗缘？”士隐道：“也不过是儿女私情罢了。”雨村听了，益发惊异：“请问仙长何出此言？”士隐道：“老先生有所不知：小女英莲，幼遭尘劫，老先生初任之时，曾经判断。今归薛姓，产难完劫，遗一子于薛家，以承宗祧。此时正是尘缘脱尽之时，只好接引接引。”士隐说着，拂袖而起。雨村心中恍恍惚惚，就在这急流津觉迷渡口草庵中睡着了。\n　　这士隐自去度脱了香菱，送到太虚幻境，交那警幻仙子对册。刚过牌访，见那一僧一道缥渺而来，士隐接着说道：“大士、真人，恭喜贺喜！情缘完结，都交割清楚了么？”那僧道说：“情缘尚未全结，倒是那蠢物已经回来了。还得把他送还原所，将他的后事叙明，不枉他下世一回。”士隐听了，便拱手而别。那僧道仍携了玉到青埂峰下，将“宝玉”安放在女娲炼石补天之处，各自云游而去．从此后：\n　　天外书传天外事，两番人作一番人。\n　　这一日，空空道人又从青埂峰前经过，见那补天未用之石仍在那里，上面字迹依然如旧，又从头的细细看了一遍。见后面偈文后历叙了多少收缘结果的话头，便点头叹道：“我从前见石兄这段奇文，原说可以闻世传奇，所以曾经抄录，但未见返本还原。不知何时，复有此段佳话？方知石兄下凡一次，磨出光明，修成圆觉，也可谓无复遗憾了。只怕年深日久，字迹模糊，反有舛错、不如我再抄录一番，寻个世上清闲无事的人，托他传遍，知道奇而不奇，俗而不俗，真而不真，假而不假。或者尘梦劳人，聊倩鸟呼归去，山灵好客，更从石化飞来，亦未可知。”想毕，便又抄了，仍袖至那繁华昌盛地方。遍寻了一番，不是建功立业之人，即系糊口谋衣之辈，那有闲情去和石头饶舌？直寻到急流津觉迷渡口草庵中，睡着一个人，因想他必是闲人，便要将这抄录的《石头记》给他看看。那知那人再叫不醒。空空道人复又使劲拉他，才慢慢的开眼坐起。便接来草草一看，仍旧掷下道：“这事我已亲见尽知，你这抄录的尚无舛错。我只指与你一个人，托他传去，便可归结这段新鲜公案了。”空空道人忙问何人，那人道：“你须待某年某月某日某时，到一个悼红轩中，有个曹雪芹先生。只说贾雨村言，托他如此如此。”说毕仍旧睡下了。\n　　那空空道人牢牢记着此言，又不知过了几世几劫，果然有个悼红轩，见那曹雪芹先生正在那里翻阅历来的古史。空空道人便将贾雨村言了，方把这《石头记》示看。那雪芹先生笑道：“果然是‘贾雨村言’了！”空空道人便问：“先生何以认得此人，便肯替他传述？”那雪芹先生笑道：“说你‘空空’，原来肚里果然空空。既是‘假语村言’，但无鲁鱼亥豕以及背谬矛盾之处，乐得与二三同志，酒馀饭饱，雨夕灯窗，同消寂寞，又不必大人先生品题传世。似你这样寻根究底，便是刻舟求剑、胶柱鼓瑟了。”那空空道人听了，仰天大笑，掷下抄本，飘然而去。一面走着，口中说道：“原来是敷衍荒唐！不但作者不知，抄者不知，并阅者也不知。不过游戏笔墨，陶情适性而已！”\n　　后人见了这本传奇，亦曾题过四句偈语，为作者缘起之言更进一竿。云：\n　　说到辛酸处，荒唐愈可悲。\n　　由来同一梦，休笑世人痴！",
  "translation": "We are told that Baochai, hearing from Qiuwen that Xiren was unwell, went in at once to see her, accompanied by Qiaojie and Pinger. They found Xiren lying on her\nkang apparently in a faint, overcome by heartache. They revived her by pouring hot water between her lips, then made her lie down again and sent to ask a doctor to come.\n\n“What made Xiren so ill, sister?” asked Qiaojie.\n\n“The other night she cried so hard that she fainted and fell down,” answered Baochai. “Her Ladyship had her carried back, and she took to her bed. We were too busy outside to call a doctor, and so she came to this.”\n\nAs she was speaking the doctor arrived, and they withdrew. After feeling her pulse he diagnosed her trouble as the result of acute distress, and wrote out a prescription before leaving.\n\nXiren had vaguely heard that if Baoyu did not come back, all his maids would be dismissed. This had so distressed her that she had taken a turn for the worse. After the doctor’s visit, while Qiuwen was preparing her medicine, she lay alone in a delirium. It seemed to her that Baoyu was there, and then that she saw a monk holding a book which he showed her, saying, “You don’t belong to me. You will belong to someone else in future.” She was about to speak to him when Qiuwen came in and announced that her medicine was ready. Opening her eyes and seeing her, Xiren knew that she had been dreaming but said nothing to the others. After taking the medicine she reflected, “Baoyu must have gone off with that monk. The time he tried to take his jade away, he was thinking of giving us the slip. When I grabbed hold of him he wasn’t his usual self at all — he pushed me away so roughly, without any feeling. Later he lost all patience with his wife, and had no feeling either for the other girls; that shows that he’s seen through the truth. But if he’s become enlightened, how could he abandon his wife? Her Ladyship assigned me to wait on him. Though my pay is that of his head maid, actually, since I never told the master or Her Ladyship, I’m counted as his concubine. If they send me away, I’ll be a laughing-stock if I insist on staying; but if I leave, how can I bear to after his love for me?” Torn by these conflicting thoughts, she was in a hopeless dilemma. Then she recalled her dream. “Since he said I belong to someone else, I may as well die and have done with it.” However, after taking the medicine her heartache lessened and she found it irksome to lie down all the time, and so forced herself to get up.\n\nA few days later she was well enough to wait on Baochai, who was missing Baoyu and weeping in secret, lamenting her fate. She knew too that her mother was trying to have her brother’s sentence commuted, which involved great difficulties; and she felt she must help her to see to it. But no more of this.\n\nJia Zheng had escorted the Lady Dowager’s coffin, and Jia Rong those of Qin Keqing, Xifeng and Yuanyang, to Jinling for burial. Jia Rong also saw to the internment of Daiyu’s coffin. Jia Zheng was busy looking after the graves. One day he received a letter from home and learned with delight that Baoyu and Jia Lan had passed the examination; but the news of Baoyu’s disappearance which followed vexed him. However, he had to go back. On the way he heard that an amnesty had been declared, and the next letter from home confirmed that he had been pardoned and reinstated. This pleased him so much that he pressed on day and night.\n\nOne day, reaching a station at Xiling in a snowstorm, they moored in a quiet spot. Jia Zheng sent servants ashore with his card to apologize to friends for not calling, explaining that his boat would set off again directly and he would not trouble them to come to see him. He kept only one page to wait on him in the boat while he wrote a letter to be sent post-haste home. When he came to the news of Baoyu he broke off. Raising his head, he saw a figure on the bow which had appeared from nowhere. Bald-headed and barefoot, it wore a red felt cape and was kneeling down to him.\n\nRecognizing him, Jia Zheng stepped hastily out of the boat and was about to accost him when the other made him a reverent greeting. Jia Zheng was on the point of returning it when a closer look showed him that this was none other than Baoyu. In great astonishment he demanded:\n\n“Are you Baoyu?”\n\nThe other simply smiled without answering, seeming both pleased and sad.\n\n“If you are Baoyu, how come you are dressed like this and here?” pursued Jia Zheng. “Why don’t you speak?”\n\nBefore Baoyu could answer, two men approached — a Buddhist monk and a Taoist — one on either side of him.\n\n“Your earthly karma is ended,” they told him. “Why not leave?” And all three of them floated up the bank.\n\nIn his haste to give chase, Jia Zheng paid no attention to the slippery snow. He hurried after them, but the three ahead were too fast for him. Then he heard one of them sing:\n\n“On Greensickness Peak I stay,\n\nThrough the Great Void I roam.\n\nWho will go with me\n\nTo the end of the earth and back to my old home?”\n\nJia Zheng, straining his ears as he ran after them, saw them turn the foot of a hill and vanish. He was too winded and bewildered to go any further. Turning back, he saw his servant following him and asked, “Did you see those three men?”\n\n“Yes, sir. When you chased them I followed too. But then you were alone, they’d disappeared.”\n\nJia Zheng would have gone on, but the white, deserted plain was completely empty. Aware that this was uncanny, he turned back.\n\nThe other servants returning to the boat had found Jia Zheng missing and asked the boatmen, who told them that he had gone ashore to chase a monk and a priest. So they had followed his footprints through the snow and now, seeing him in the distance, went to meet him and accompanied him back to the boat. Jia Zheng sat down, and when he had recovered his breath he told them what had happened. They wanted to make a search of the place, but he demurred.\n\n“You don’t understand,” he said with a sigh. “I saw this with my own eyes; it was no apparition. Besides, the song I heard was full of mystery. Baoyu was born with a piece of jade in his mouth, which was already strange. I’ve long known that this was an ill omen. It was only because the old lady doted on him that we brought him up. I saw that monk and priest three times. The first time, they came to explain the magic of the jade; the second time, when Baoyu was so ill, they came to save him by reciting some incantation over the jade; the third time, they returned the jade and sat in the hall — then in a flash they vanished. I thought then that it was strange, but assumed that because Baoyu was so lucky these immortals had come to protect him. Little did I know that he was an immortal who had taken human form to experience the mundane world! We’d been fooling the old lady all these nineteen years! Now at last I understand.” At this point he broke down and wept.\n\n“If Master Bao was really an immortal, why did he have to pass the examination before leaving?” the servants asked.\n\n“How could you know such things? All the stars in heaven, all the hermits in the mountains, the spirits in caves — they have their own nature. Did you ever see Baoyu study? If he’d only concentrated a little, there was nothing he couldn’t do. His temperament was unique.”\n\nHe sighed again, and his servants tried to console him by reminding him of Lan’s success and the family’s imminent revival. Then Jia Zheng wrote a letter home, describing all that had happened and urging his household not to grieve. This he gave to a servant to deliver, while he himself travelled on post-haste. But no more of this.\n\nLet us return to Aunt Xue. When she heard that their sentence had been commuted, she sent Xue Ke to raise a loan and herself made up the sum needed to redeem Pan. The Board of Punishments having accepted this and issued a warrant for his release, the family was reunited. We can imagine the mixture of joy and sorrow at their meeting.\n\nXue Pan now gathered together all his former boon companions and swore an oath to them: “If I ever revert to my old ways, may I be hacked to pieces!”\n\n“What need to swear such a ghastly oath?” protested his mother, covering his mouth with her hand. “All you need is determination. And think of Caltrop, and all the misery you’ve caused her. Your wife brought about her own death. We may be poor now, but at least we still have enough to eat. I think we should make Caltrop your wife. What do you say?”\n\nXue Pan nodded his assent. Bao-chai and the others were also in favour. Caltrop herself, however, blushed scarlet and protested:\n\n“I’m quite happy to go on serving the young master as before. There’s no need for this!”\n\nThey started calling her ‘Mrs Xue’, and there were no further dissenting voices.\n\nXue Pan wanted to go and express his gratitude to the Jias, and his mother and Bao-chai accompanied him. They were received by the family, and a general reunion was celebrated, with much conversation. In the midst of this, a servant of Jia Zheng’s arrived home and delivered a letter to Lady Wang, announcing that his master would be returning shortly. She asked Jia Lan to read the letter aloud to them all. When he came to the passage describing Jia Zheng’s meeting with Bao-yu, everyone began to weep, Lady Wang, Bao-chai and Aroma more bitterly than the rest. They tried to comfort themselves by reading into Jia Zheng’s words the idea that Bao-yu had never been intended for an official career, that his destiny had been of a different order altogether.\n\n“If he had become an official,’ they reasoned, ‘and then something had gone wrong, if he had been mixed up in some disgraceful affair and brought ruin on the family, that would have been far worse. It is better by far that we should have had a saint in our midst. It is a mark of Sir Zheng and Lady Wang’s virtue that he was born into our family. We don’t wish to speak out of turn, but the old master in the Eastern Mansion practised yoga for ten or twenty years, and even he never attained enlightenment. It is much harder to become a Buddha. If you look at it in this light, my lady, it should be a comfort to you.’\n\n‘I know I should hate Bao-yu for deserting me,’ sobbed Lady Wang to Aunt Xue. ‘But my real sorrow is for my daughter-in-law. She was only married a year or two; how could he find it in his heart to abandon her?’\n\nAunt Xue was herself too distraught to be of much comfort. Bao-chai had cried until she was unconscious. The men were all out of the house, and Lady Wang continued:\n\n‘All my life I have lived in fear of what he might do. I had just begun to feel happy: he was married, he had passed his examination, and I knew that my daughter-in-law was expecting a child. And now it has all come to this! If I had known, I would never have allowed him to marry. I have brought nothing but misery upon this poor child!’\n\n‘It was her destiny,’ replied Aunt Xue. ‘And in a family such as ours, what else can one say? We must be thankful that she is with child. The boy she bears is sure to do well in life, and that will be some consolation. Look at Mrs Lan: her son has passed the provincial examination, and next year he is sure to pass the palace examination and become an official. Her sufferings are over, and she is beginning to reap her reward. That is her just desert. You know my daughter’s character, sister; she is not a petty or frivolous person. There is no need for you to worry on her account.’\n\nLady Wang found these words a great comfort.\n\n‘Bao-chai was always such a quiet, undemanding child, so simple in her tastes,’ she thought to herself. ‘That is why this had to happen. It makes one believe in a preordained pattern in people’s lives. And look at her now: she may be crying her heart out, but she still behaves with perfect dignity, and even tries to comfort me. She is a remarkable young woman. Who would have thought that Bao-yu, of all people, would have been denied every blessing on earth!’\n\nThese reflections eased her grief a little. Then her thoughts turned to Aroma.\n\n‘The other maids are easily provided for: the older ones can be married off, the younger ones can wait on Bao-chai. But what is to be done with Aroma?’\n\nThere were too many people present for her to broach the subject now, and she decided to wait until the evening, when she would be able to discuss it with Aunt Xue.\n\nThat day Aunt Xue did not go home but stayed to keep Baochai company and comfort her. Baochai, however, being a very sensible girl, thought things over and concluded, “Baoyu was always an eccentric; this was predestined and no one is to blame.” She even reasoned with her mother in this way. So consoled was Aunt Xue that she called on Lady Wang and told her this.\n\nLady Wang nodded and sighed. “If I’d no virtue, I wouldn’t deserve such a good daughter-in-law.” This reminded her again of her loss and she started weeping. Aunt Xue did her best to console her.\n\nThen Xiren was mentioned. “I noticed how thin she’s grown recently,” said Aunt Xue. “She’s pining for Baoyu. A wife should remain chaste, of course, and sometimes even a concubine. But though Xiren was considered his concubine, actually Baoyu never made it official.”\n\n“I was just thinking of that and meaning to have a talk with you,” replied Lady Wang. “If we send her away, she may be unwilling and try to kill herself; but if we keep her, my husband may not agree. So it’s difficult.”\n\n“In my opinion, your husband certainly won’t let her stay. Besides, he doesn’t know about Xiren — he just thinks her one of the maids, so why should he keep her? You must send for her parents and tell them to find her a good husband. Give her some things to take with her too. She’s a good, young girl, and it’s only right after her years of service to you. I’ll have a good talk with her. When her family comes, don’t let her know. Wait till they’ve found her a good family, then we can make some inquiries. If they’re well off and the young man is presentable, we can send her there.”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” said Lady Wang. “Otherwise, if my husband handles it hastily, I shall be the ruin of another girl.”\n\nAunt Xue nodded and after a little further conversation went back to Baochai’s room. When she saw Xiren in tears, she tried to comfort her. Xiren, an artless girl, not glib-tongued, agreed to all she said.\n\n“I’m only a servant,” she answered. “The mistresses are so good to me, talking to me like this. I wouldn’t dare disobey.”\n\nAunt Xue was thinking, “What a good, biddable girl!” and she took an even greater liking to her. Baochai too spoke of the great principles involved, and so all of them were reconciled to the situation.\n\nA few days later Jia Zheng came home. He was welcomed by the whole family, and when he saw that Jia She and Jia Zhen were back too, the uncles, brothers and nephews compared notes on all that had happened during their absence. Then the ladies paid their respects, and inevitably the talk turned to Baoyu, reducing them to tears again until Jia Zheng stopped them.\n\n“This is fated,” he said. “Now that I’m home I shall take charge of outside business, and you must help by managing things inside. We mustn’t let the household drift as before. The other branches will have to fend for themselves; there’s no need to supervise them. You must take sole charge of our household, and see that everything is done properly.”\n\nLady Wang told him then that Baochai was with child, and that in future all the maids would be sent away. Jia Zheng nodded in silence.\n\nThe next day he went to the court to express his gratitude for the Emperor’s favour, and asked the ministers to advise him as to the proper procedure, the period of mourning not being yet over. They promised to ask for instructions, and the Emperor in his magnanimity decreed that he\n\nJia Zheng Was Summoned to an AudienceHaving thanked the Emperor for his audience, Jia Zheng was further favoured with many instructions. When His Majesty asked about Baoyu, Jia Zheng reported truthfully.\n\nThe Emperor expressed his amazement, then decreed: “Baoyu’s essays show remarkable originality, and he must be a man of great experience. If he were willing to serve at court, we would make use of his talents. But since he has declined the honour of an official rank, we bestow on him instead the Taoist title of ‘Marvellous Divine.’” Jia Zheng kowtowed his thanks again and withdrew.\n\nWhen he reached home, Jia Lian and Jia Zhen came to meet him. He described to them all that had happened at court, to their great delight. Jia Zhen then reported, “The Ning Mansion has been put in order and I’ve asked permission to move back there. The Convent of Secluded Fragrance, being inside the Garden, will be left for our fourth sister to practise meditation in.”\n\nJia Zheng made no comment, but after a pause urged them to show their gratitude to the Emperor.\n\nJia Lian took this chance to report, “My father and mother have agreed to let Qiaojie marry into the Zhou family.”\n\nHaving heard the whole story the previous evening, Jia Zheng said, “Your parents are in favour of it? Well, if the family is respectable, the boy studies hard and has good prospects, what does it matter if they live in the country? Not all the court officials are townsfolk, are they?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Jia Lian. Then he went on, “My father is getting on in years and is liable to phlegm; he needs to rest quietly for a few years, so he hopes you will take charge of everything here.”\n\n“The idea of living quietly in the country appeals to me too,” replied Jia Zheng. “But I’ve received such great favours from the court that I’ve not yet been able to repay them.” With that he went inside.\n\nJia Lian sent to ask Granny Liu over and gave her their consent. When she called on Lady Wang and the others she predicted that the Jia family would win promotion, make a fresh start and have a host of descendants.\n\nAs they were chatting, a maid announced, “Huazi-fang’s wife is here to pay her respects.” Lady Wang had a few words with her. The woman said that a relative had acted as matchmaker to propose a match with the Jiang family south of the city, who had land and houses as well as shops. The young gentleman was a few years older than Xiren, had never been married before, and was one in a hundred for good looks. Lady Wang, pleased with this proposal, said, “Go and accept, then come back in a few days to fetch your sister-in-law.” She made inquiries and, hearing a good report of the Jiangs, told Baochai and asked Aunt Xue to break the news to Xiren.\n\nXiren was overwhelmed with grief, but could not refuse to obey. She recalled Baoyu’s visit to her home and his assurance on his return that he would never let her go back. “Now that Her Ladyship has made this decision, if I insist on staying I’ll be laughed at for shamelessness; yet to leave is against my wishes.” She cried in secret until she was choked with tears. Xue Yano and Baochai having reasoned with her, she thought, “If I kill myself here, I shall辜负 Lady Wang’s kindness. I should go home to die.” So she took a tearful leave of them all. The parting between her and the other maids was naturally most distressing.\n\nConvinced that she would kill herself, Xiren went home in a carriage. When she saw her brother and his wife, though she wept she could not speak out. Huazi-fang showed her the Jiang family’s betrothal gifts and the dowry he had prepared, pointing out which items were gifts from Lady Wang and which bought by himself. Xiren found it even harder to say anything then. After two days’ reflection it struck her that her brother had done all this for her. “If I kill myself here, I shall only make trouble for him.” Torn by indecision, her heart almost broken, she had to bottle up her grief.\n\nThen came the auspicious day for the wedding. As Xiren was not a forward girl, she mounted the bridal sedan-chair in distress, meaning to wait till she reached the Jiangs’ before deciding what to do. But to her surprise, the Jiangs went about the wedding most conscientiously and were so\n\nAccording to the rule for a wife, as soon as she entered the house, all the maids and servants would address her as “madam.” Xiren felt she would rather die; but she was afraid that would harm the Jiangs and let down their kindness to her. That night she had wept and refused to let her husband approach her; but he had been so considerate and gentle that she had to give in. The next day, when her dowry chests were opened, Jiang saw the crimson silk sash and realized then that she was Baoyu’s maid. He had thought she was simply the old lady’s servant, never guessing that she was Xiren. Remembering then all Baoyu’s past kindness to him, he was overcome by shame and treated her even more considerately. He deliberately showed her the pale green sash he had exchanged with Baoyu, and at sight of it Xiren knew that he was Jiang Yuhan. Then she realized that their marriage had been predestined, and told him what was on her mind. Jiang, full of sighs and greater respect for her, did not force her but treated her even more tenderly, so that she really had no way to die.\n\nGentle readers, although all is predestined and we have no alternative, yet “had no alternative” cannot be used as a blanket excuse by unfilial sons, disloyal ministers, unrighteous husbands or unchaste wives. That is why Xiren is in the “Supplementary Register of Beauties.” The poem on the Shrine of the Lady of Peach-Blossoms puts it well:\n\nHardest of all is to die, as was proved in olden days;\nNot only Lady Xi was unstrung by heart-rending grief!\n\nBut enough of Xiren, whose life now took a different turn.\n\nJia Yucun had been found guilty of extortion and sentenced, but he was pardoned when a general amnesty was declared, reduced to the status of a commoner and sent back to his native place. He told his family to go on ahead while he himself, with one page and a cartload of luggage, came to the Ford of Awakening by Rapid Stream. There a Taoist priest stepped out of a thatched shed by the ford and accosted him with a clasped hands salute. Yucun recognized Zhen Shiyin and hastily returned the greeting.\n\n“How have you been all this time, Mr. Jia?” inquired Shiyin.\n\n“So you are Master Zhen!” exclaimed Yucun. “Why the last time we met, you pretended not to know me? Thanks to your advice I was able to extricate myself from a difficult situation, and later when your thatched cot was burned down I was very upset. But now that I am fortunate enough to meet you again, I realize how profound your wisdom is. The trouble is that I am too obtuse to have followed your advice, which is why I have come to this.”\n\nShiyin said, “I did not presume to recognize you, sir, in your exalted position then. It was because of our old friendship that I ventured to give you a word of warning, not expecting you to spurn it. But wealth and poverty, success and failure are all predestined; and this new meeting today is no coincidence. My humble cottage is not far from here. Will you condescend to step in for a chat?”\n\nYucun readily agreed. They walked hand in hand, the page following with the cart, till they came to a thatched cottage.\n\nShiyin invited Yucun in and offered him a seat, after which a lad served tea.\n\nYucun asked, “May I know how you, venerable immortal, were able to foresee the future and achieve such spiritual awakening?”\n\nShiyin smiled. “It is a long story, which can be summed up in a single phrase: enlightenment comes with one single thought. As you have come from the world of red dust, you must know of Baoyu of the House of Jinling?”\n\n“Of course! I have heard recently that he has become a monk. When I used to see him in the past I never thought him so resolute.”\n\n“No, you are wrong,” said Shiyin. “I knew of this strange destiny of his long ago. Even before our talk that day at the gate of my old house in Gourd Temple, I had met him once.”\n\n“How could that be?” Yucun exclaimed in surprise. “Your honourable district is a long way from the capital.”\n\n“We had a spiritual affinity.”\n\n“If so, you must know his present whereabouts.”\n\n“Baoyu is the incarnation of the Stone of Spiritual Understanding. After the confiscation of the Rong and Ning Mansions and the separation of Baochai and Daiyu, that Stone left the world of men, partly to escape from trouble and partly to bring the two girls together. Then, its karma fulfilled, it reverted to its true form. To show its divine power it helped its son to come first in the examinations and inherit the title, so that all might know that this miraculous jade, tempered by the essences of Heaven and Earth, is not to be compared with common gems. After the Buddhist of Infinite Space and the Taoist of Boundless Time took it down to earth, now that its earthly karma is completed they have taken it back to its source. This is the whole truth.”\n\nWhen the time came the two men brought him back to his original state — and that was Baoyu’s end.”\n\nAlthough Yucun could not take all this in, he had a rough idea of the meaning and nodded with a sigh. “So that’s how it was. I was too dull to realize it. But since Baoyu had such a background, how was it that he became so infatuated and then so suddenly enlightened? May I ask you to explain?”\n\n“What I have to say, sir, may not be clear to you,” said Shiyin with a smile. “The Illusory Land of Great Void is in fact the real Place of Blessedness. Having seen the registers twice through, he knew the way from the beginning to the end of his life — how could he not become enlightened? The fairy plant’s return to truth shows how its divine nature was restored.”\n\nYucun, though not understanding, knew that this was an oracle and did not like to question him further. He simply observed, “In our clan so many girls have outstanding gifts — how is it that from the Imperial Consort down, all of them come to a sad end? Can this be determined by fate?”\n\n“You must not ask that, venerable sir,” said Shiyin with a sigh. “The daughters of your noble house came from the Ocean of Calamity and the Heaven of Love. Most women in ancient or modern times have not only shunned the word ‘licentious’ but disliked even the word ‘love.’ That is why all fairies are susceptible to worldly feelings, and men of letters are prone to make mischief. As for those who are deeply addicted to love, their end is always tragic.”\n\nYucun at this could not help stroking his beard and sighing. “May I ask, immortal sir,” he said, “whether the Rong and Ning Mansions can continue to prosper as before?”\n\n“Good fortune comes from virtue, calamity from sin. This has been an immutable law since ancient times. Now that the worthy men of the Rong and Ning Houses are cultivating virtue and the wicked are repenting their crimes, it stands to reason that their兰花 and osmanthus should flourish together and their family fortunes be restored.”\n\nYucun lowered his head in thought, then said with a smile, “That’s right, that’s right. In their house there is one called Lan who has passed the provincial examination. That fits the word ‘兰花.’ And just now you spoke of ‘兰花 and osmanthus flourishing together.’ You also mentioned that Baoyu had a noble son who came first in the examinations. Does this mean that he has a posthumous son who will make good?”\n\nShiyin gave a faint smile. “That comes later. This is not the time to speak of it.”\n\nWhen Yucun would have questioned him further, Shiyin ignored him and ordered a simple meal to be prepared. After they had eaten, Yucun was still anxious to know what his own future would be.\n\n“You had better rest here for a while in my humble cell,” said Shiyin. “I still have an unfulfilled mission to accomplish today.”\n\n“What mission can an immortal like yourself still have in the mundane world?” asked Yucun in surprise.\n\n“It is no more than a private concern to do with my daughter.”\n\nYucun was more amazed than ever. “I have heard that your daughter died long ago. How can you have a mission in connection with her?”\n\n“You do not know, sir,” replied Shiyin, “that my daughter Yinglian was involved in a lawsuit when you were first appointed. Now that she has married into the Xue family and died in childbirth, leaving a son to carry on the Xue line, her earthly trials are over and it is time for me to take her away.” So saying he stood up.\n\nYucun, feeling dazed, dropped asleep in the thatched cottage by the Ford of Awakening.\n\nThen Shiyin, having gone to take Yinglian away from the Xue family and escort her to the Illusory Land of Great Void to hand her over to the Goddess of Disenchantment for registration, had just passed the stone arch when he saw a Buddhist and a Taoist priest approaching, and he greeted them.\n\n“Reverend gentlemen,” he said, “congratulations on your successful completion of your love karma. Is everything settled?”\n\n“The love karma is not yet completely settled, but that stupid object is back,” they replied. “We must take it to its original place and record all that happened to it, so that this episode may not be unknown to the world.” Shiyin bowed in agreement.\n\nThe monk and the Taoist then took the jade to the foot of Blue Ridge Peak and laid it on the spot where the Goddess Nu Wo had melted down the rock to repair the sky. Then they went their separate ways.\n\nHenceforth:\n\nEvents not of this world are passed on as a tale;\n\nAfter twice retiring from the world, one becomes immortal.\n\nOne day the Taoist in Vacuity, passing by Blue Ridge Peak, saw that stone still there, on which was inscribed its full experiences.\n\nOnce more he saw the stone which had been rejected for mending the sky, with the same inscription on it as before. He read this through again carefully from start to finish, and noticed an additional record of the fate of the different characters in the form of a postscript. Nodding and sighing he reflected, “When I read Brother Stone’s record of marvels before, I thought it might serve to dispel boredom and so I copied it down; but I did not know the end of the story. Now at last I know that it returned to its source. So Brother Stone’s descent to earth was a case of ‘glistening jade emerging from the dust’ and after its trials it became immortal and achieved nirvana — truly it can have no regrets. But I’m afraid its inscription may become blurred in the course of time, and people may make mistakes in copying it. Why don’t I copy it out again too and find some leisure-loving person to circulate it, so that all may know that the fantastic is not fantastic, the common-place not common-place, the real not real, the unreal not unreal? Maybe too, weary of the dusty world, men may welcome this fairy tale as a summons to escape from their dreams, or be moved by it to seek immortality through self-cultivation....” Having come to this conclusion, he made another copy and took it to find some quiet spot in that busy, prosperous world. But after looking all around he found that all were either engrossed in the pursuit of fame and fortune, or too busy making a living to bother with such things as this. And he could not find a single man in all that world with leisure enough to transmit this record.\n\nHe went on searching until he came to the Jilijin Juemidu Ford, and in a thatched hut there he found a man fast asleep. Taking him for a man of leisure, he made over this copy of The Tale of the Stone to him. But though he called him repeatedly, the sleeper did not wake up. Not until Kongkong the Taoist gave him a great shake did he slowly sit up and open his eyes. He skimmed through the manuscript and laid it down.\n\n“I have seen this record myself,” he said, “and your copy is accurate. I can introduce you to someone to pass it on to him so that this remarkable case can be made known.”\n\nKongkong asked eagerly to whom.\n\n“Wait till some year, some month, some day, some hour,” was the answer, “and then go to the Mourning-the-Red Studio. There you will find a certain Mr. Cao Xueqin. All you have to say to him is: ‘Jia Yucun has something to say about the world of men.’ With that he will pass it on for you.” With that he lay down and went to sleep again.\n\nKongkong the Taoist remembered this carefully, and after who knows how many generations or aeons he did indeed find the Mourning-the-Red Studio, where Mr. Cao Xueqin was reading the histories of the past. When he delivered his message, Cao Xueqin laughed and said, “So it’s Jia Yucun, is it?”\n\n“How do you know him, sir?” asked Kongkong. “Why should you be willing to pass this on for him?”\n\n“You may be empty, but you’re certainly stupid!” Cao Xueqin chuckled. “Since it’s mere foolish talk in the village, so long as there are no mistakes in the dates and it doesn’t slander the age or contain any improper passages, it can serve to pass the time with friends after wine and meals, or to dispel loneliness on rainy days and windy nights. As for the rest, men may make of it what they please. Why should I worry about passing it on? As for Jia Yucun, he’s a shrewd, worldly fellow — why should he talk like this? That would be most out of character. Most likely he was afraid that this record might be laughed at by the world for its eccentricity, or that it might offend the powerful; and so he used my name to get it passed on, putting all the blame on me.”\n\nAt that Kongkong burst out laughing and, tossing the manuscript down, went off with a flourish, declaring, “So it was all nonsense! Not only did the author not know what he was writing about, even the copyist didn’t; much less will any reader understand it. This was just a literary diversion to amuse myself and others.”\n\nLater someone wrote the following quatrain to round off this fable:\n\nPages full of fantastic talk\nPenned with bitter tears;\nAll men call the author mad,\nNone his message hears."
