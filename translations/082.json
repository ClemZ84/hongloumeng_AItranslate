  "original": "话说宝玉下学回来，见了贾母。贾母笑道：“好了，如今野马上了笼头了。去罢，见见你老爷去来，散散儿去罢。”宝玉答应着，去见贾政。贾政道：“这早晚就下学了么？师父给你定了工课没有？”宝玉道：“定了，早起理书，饭后写字，晌午讲书念文章。”贾政听了，点点头儿，因道：“去罢，还到老太太那边陪着坐坐去。你也该学些人功道理，别一味的贪玩。晚上早些睡，天天上学，早些起来。你听见了？”宝玉连忙答应几个“是”，退出来，忙忙又去见王夫人，又到贾母那边打了个照面儿。赶着出来，恨不得一走就走到潇湘馆才好。\n　　刚进门口，便拍着手笑道：“我依旧回来了。”猛可里倒唬了黛玉一跳。紫鹃打起帘子，宝玉进来坐下。黛玉道：“我恍惚听见你念书去了，这么早就回来了？”宝玉道：“嗳呀了不得！我今儿不是被老爷叫了念书去了么？心上倒象没有和你们见面的日子了。好容易熬了一天，这会子瞧见你们，竟如死而复生一样。真真古人说‘一日三秋’，这话再不错的。“黛玉道：“你上头去过了没有？”宝玉道：“都去过了。”黛玉道：“别处呢？”宝玉道：“没有。”黛玉道：“你也该瞧瞧他们去。”宝玉道：“我这会子懒怠动了，只和妹妹坐着说一会子话儿罢。老爷还叫早睡早起，只好明儿再瞧他们去了。”黛玉道：“你坐坐儿，可是正该歇歇儿去了。”宝玉道：“我那里是乏？只是闷得慌。这会子咱们坐着，才把闷散了，你又催起我来！”黛玉微微的一笑。因叫紫鹃：“把我的龙井茶给二爷沏一碗。二爷如今念书了，比不得头里。”紫鹃笑着答应，去拿茶叶，叫小丫头子沏茶。宝玉接着说道：“还提什么念书？我最厌这些道学话。更可笑的是八股文章，拿他诓功名混饭吃也罢了，还要说‘代圣贤立言’。好些的，不过拿些经书凑搭凑搭还罢了。更有一种可笑的，肚子里原没有什么，东拉西扯，弄的牛鬼蛇神，还自以为博奥。这那里是阐发圣贤的道理？目下老爷口口声声叫我学这个，我又不敢违拗，你这会子还提念书呢！”黛玉道：“我们女孩儿家虽然不要这个，但小时跟着你们雨村先生念书，也曾看过。内中也有近情近理的，也有清微淡远的。那时候虽不大懂，也觉得好，不可一概抹倒。况且你要取功名，这个也清贵些。”宝玉听到这里，觉得不甚入耳，因想：“黛玉从来不是这样人，怎么也这样势欲熏心起来？”又不敢在他跟前驳回，只在鼻子眼里笑了一声。\n　　正说着，忽听外面两个人说话，却是秋纹和紫鹃。只听秋纹说：“袭人姐姐叫我老太太那里接去，谁知却在这。”紫鹃道：“我们这里才沏了茶，索性让他喝了再去。”说着，二人一齐进来。宝玉和秋纹笑道：“我就过去。又劳动你来找。”秋纹未及答言，只见紫鹃道：“你快喝了茶去罢。人家都想了一天了。”秋纹啐道：“呸！好混账丫头。”说的大家都笑了。宝玉起身，才辞了出来。黛玉送到屋门口儿，紫鹃在台阶下站着，宝玉出去，才回房里来。\n　　却说宝玉回到怡红院中，进了屋子，只见袭人从里间迎出来，便问：“回来了么？”秋纹应道：“二爷早来了，在林姑娘那边来着。”宝玉道：“今日有事没有？”袭人道：“事却没有。方才太太叫鸳鸯姐姐来吩咐我们，如今老爷发狠叫你念书，如有丫鬟们再敢和你玩笑，都要照着晴雯、司棋的例办。我想伏侍你一场，赚了这些言语，也没什么趣儿。”说着，便伤起心来。宝玉忙道：“好姐姐，你放心，我只好生念书，太太再不说你们了。我今儿晚上还要看书，明日师父叫我讲书呢。我要使唤，横竖有麝月、秋纹呢，你歇歇去罢。”袭人道：“你要真肯念书，我们伏侍你也是欢喜的。”宝玉听了，赶忙的吃了晚饭，就叫点灯，把念过的《四书》翻出来。只是从何处看起？翻了一本看去，章章里头，似乎明白，细按起来，却不很明白。看着小注，又看讲章。闹到起更以后了，自己想道：“我在诗词上觉得很容易，在这个上头竟没头脑。”便坐着呆呆的呆想。袭人道：“歇歇罢。做工夫也不在这一时的。”宝玉嘴里只管胡乱答应。麝月、袭人才伏侍他睡下，两个才也睡了。及至睡醒一觉，听得宝玉炕上还是翻来覆去。袭人道：“你还醒着呢么？你倒别混想了，养养神明儿好念书。”宝玉道：“我也是这样想，只是睡不着，你来给我揭去一层被。”袭人道：“天气不热，别揭罢。”宝玉道：“我心里烦躁的很。”自把被窝褪下来。袭人忙爬起来按住，把手去他头上一摸，觉得微微有些发烧。袭人道：“你别动了，有些发烧了。”宝玉道：“可不是？”袭人道：“这是怎么说呢！”宝玉道：“不怕，是我心烦的原故，你别吵嚷。省得老爷知道了，必说我装病逃学，不然怎么病的这么巧？明儿好了，原到学里去，就完事了。”袭人也觉得可怜，说道：“我靠着你睡罢。”便和宝玉捶了一回脊梁。不知不觉，大家都睡着了。\n　　直到红日高升，方才起来。宝玉道：“不好了，晚了。”急忙梳洗毕，问了安，就往学里来了。代儒已经变着脸，说：“怪不得你老爷生气，说你没出息。第二天你就懒惰。这是什么时候才来？”宝玉把昨儿发烧的话说了一遍，方过去了，原旧念书。到了下晚，代儒道：“宝玉，有一章书，你来讲讲。”宝玉过来一看，却是“后生可畏”章。宝玉心上说：“这还好，幸亏不是《学》《庸》。”问道：“怎么讲呢？”代儒道：“你把节旨句子细细儿讲来。”宝玉把这章先朗朗的念了一遍，说：“这章书是圣人勉励后生，教他及时努力，不要弄到……”说到这里，抬头向代儒一看。代儒觉得了，笑了一笑道：“你只管说，讲书是没有什么避忌的。《礼记》上说：‘临文不讳’。只管说，‘不要弄到’什么？”宝玉道：“不要弄到老大无成。先将‘可畏’二字激发后生的志气，后把‘不足畏’，三字警惕后生的将来。”说罢，看着代儒。代儒道：“也还罢了。串讲呢？”宝玉道：“圣人说：人生少时，心思才力，样样聪明能干，实在是可怕的，那里料的定他后来的日子不象我的今日？若是悠悠忽忽，到了四十岁，又到五十岁，既不能够发达，这种人，虽是他后生时象个有用的，到了那个时候，这一辈子就没有人怕他了。”代儒笑道：“你方才节旨讲的倒清楚，只是句子里有些孩子气。‘无闻’二字，不是不能发达做官的话。‘闻’是实在自己能够明理见道，就不做官也是有闻了；不然，古圣贤是遁世不见知的，岂不是不做官的人，难道也是无闻么？‘不足畏’是使人料得定，方与‘焉知’的‘知’字对针，不是‘怕’的字眼。要从这里看出，方能入细。你懂得不懂得？”宝玉道：“懂得了。”\n　　代儒道：“还有一章，你也讲一讲。”代儒往前提了一篇，指给宝玉。宝玉看时：“吾未见好德如好色者也”。宝玉觉得这一章却有些刺心，便陪笑道：“这句话没有什么讲头。”代儒道：“胡说。譬如场中出了这个题目，也说没有做头么？”宝玉不得已，讲道：“是圣人看见人不肯好德，见了色，便好的了不得，殊不想德是性中本有的东西，人偏都不肯好他。至于那个色呢，虽也是从先天中带来，无人不好的，但是德乃天理，色是人欲，人那里肯把天理好的象人欲似的？孔子虽是叹息的话，又是望人回转来的意思。并且见得人就有好德的，好的终是浮浅，直要象色一样的好起来，那才是真好呢。”代儒道：“这也讲的罢了。我有句问你：你既懂得圣人的话，为什么正犯着这两件病？我虽不在家中，你们老爷也不曾告诉我，其实你的毛病我却尽知的。做一个人，怎么不望长进？你这会儿正是‘后生可畏’的时侯。‘有闻’‘不足畏’，全在你自己做去个月文章，以后我要出题目叫你作文章了。如若懈怠，我是断乎不依的。自古道：‘成人不自在，自在不成人。’你好生记着我的话。”宝玉答应了，也只得天天按着功课干去，不提。\n　　且说宝玉上学之后，怡红院中甚觉清净闲暇，袭人倒可做些活计，拿着针线要绣个槟榔包儿。想这如今宝玉有了功课，丫头们可也没有饥荒了，早要如此，晴雯何至弄到没有结果？兔死狐悲，不觉叹起气来。忽又想到自己终身，本不是宝玉的正配，原是偏房。宝玉的为人却还拿得住，只怕娶了一个利害的，自己便是尤二姐、香菱的后身。素来看着贾母，王夫人光景，及凤姐儿往往露出话来，自然是黛玉无疑了。那黛玉就是个多心人。想到此际，脸红心热，拿着针不知戳到那里去了。便把活计放下，走到黛玉处去探探他的口气。\n　　黛玉正在那里看书，见是袭人，欠身让坐。袭人也连忙迎上来问：“姑娘这几天身子可大好了？”黛玉道：“那里能够，不过略硬朗些。你在家里做什么呢？”袭人道：“如今宝二爷上了学，屋里一点事儿没有，因此来瞧瞧姑娘，说说话儿。”说着，紫鹃拿茶来，袭人忙站来道：“妹妹坐着罢。”因又笑道：“我前儿听见秋纹说，妹妹背地里说我们什么来着？”紫鹃也笑道：“姐姐信他的话，我说宝二爷上了学，宝姑娘又隔断了，连香菱也不过来，自然是闷的。”袭人道：“你还提香菱呢，这才苦呢！撞着这位‘太岁奶奶’，难为他怎么过！”把手伸着两个指头，道：“说起来，比他还利害，连外头的脸面都不顾了。”黛玉接着道：“他也够受了。尤二姐怎么死了！”袭人道：“可不是。想来都是一个人，不过名分里头差些，何苦这样毒？外面名声也不好听。”黛玉从不闻袭人背地里说人，今听此话有因，心里一动，便说道：“这也难说。但凡家庭之事，不是东风压了西风，就是西风压了东风。”袭人道：“做了旁边人，心里先怯，那里倒敢欺负人呢？”\n　　说着，只见一个婆子在院里问道：“这里是林姑娘的屋子么？那位姐姐在这里呢？”雪雁出来一看，模糊认的是薛姨妈那边的人，便问道：“作什么？”婆子道：“我们姑娘打发来给这里林姑娘送东西的。”雪雁道：“略等等儿。”雪雁进来回了黛玉，黛玉便叫领他进来。那婆子进来，请了安，且不说送什么，只是觑着眼瞧黛玉，看的黛玉脸上倒不好意思起来，因问道：“宝姑娘叫你来送什么？”婆子方笑着回道：“我们姑娘叫给姑娘送一瓶儿蜜饯荔枝来。”回头又瞧见袭人，便问道：“这位姑娘，不是宝二爷屋里的花姑娘么？”袭人笑道：“妈妈怎么认的我？”婆子笑道：“我们只在太太屋里看屋子，不大跟太太姑娘出门，所以姑娘们都不大认得。姑娘们碰着到我们那边去，我们都模糊记得。\n”说着，将一个瓶儿递给雪雁，又回头看看黛玉，因笑着向袭人说：“怨不得我们太太说，这林姑娘和你们宝二爷是一对儿，原来真是天仙似的！”袭人见他说话造次，连忙岔道：“妈妈，你乏了，坐坐吃茶罢。”那婆子笑嘻嘻的道：“我们那里忙呢。都张罗琴姑娘的事呢。姑娘还有两瓶荔枝，叫给宝二爷送去。”说着，颤颤巍巍告辞出去。黛玉虽恼这婆子方才冒撞，但因是宝钗使来的，也不好怎么样他，等他出了屋门，才说一声道：“给你们姑娘道费心。”那老婆子还只管嘴里咕咕哝哝的说：“这样好模样儿，除了宝玉，什么人擎受的起！”黛玉只装没听见。袭人笑道：“怎么人到了老来，就是混说白道的，叫人听着又生气，又好笑。”一时雪雁拿过瓶子来给黛玉看，黛玉道：“我懒怠吃，拿了搁起去罢。”又说了一回话，袭人才去了。\n　　一时晚妆将卸，黛玉进了套间，猛抬头看见了荔枝瓶，不禁想起日间老婆子的一番混话，甚是刺心。当此黄昏人静，干愁万绪堆上心来，想起：“自己身子不牢，年纪又大了，看宝玉的光景，心里虽没别人，但是老太太、舅母又不见有半点意思，深恨父母在时，何不早定了这头婚姻。”又转念一想道：“倘若父母在时，别处定了婚姻，怎能够似宝玉这般人材心地？不如此时尚有可图。”心内一上一下，辗转缠绵，竟象辘轳一般。叹了一回气，吊了几点泪，无情无绪，和衣倒下。\n　　不知不觉，只见小丫头走来说道：“外面雨村贾老爷请姑娘。”黛玉道：“我虽跟他读过书，却不比男学生，要见我做什么？况且他和舅舅往来，从未提起，我也不必见的。”因叫小丫头回复：“身上有病，不能出来，与我请安道谢就是了。”小丫头道：“只怕要与姑娘道喜，南京还有人来接。”说着，又见凤姐同邢夫人、王夫人、宝钗等都来笑道：“我们一来道喜，二来送行。”黛玉慌道：“你们说什么话？”凤姐道：“你还装什么呆？你难道不知道，林姑爷升了湖北的粮道，娶了一位继母，十分合心合意。如今想着你撂在这里，不成事体，因托了贾雨村作媒，将你许了你继母的什么亲戚，还说是续弦，所以着人到这里来接你回去。大约一到家中，就要过去的。都是你继母作主。怕的是道儿上没有照应，还叫你琏二哥哥送去。”说得黛玉一身冷汗。黛玉又恍惚父亲果在那里做官的样子。心上急着，硬说道：“没有的事，都是凤姐姐混闹！”只见邢夫人向王夫人使个眼色儿：“他还不信呢，咱们走罢。”黛玉含着泪道：“二位舅母坐坐去。”众人不言语，都冷笑而去。\n　　黛玉此时心中干急，又说不出来，哽哽咽咽，恍惚又是和贾母在一处的似的，心中想道：“此事惟求老太太，或还有救。”于是两腿跪下去，抱着贾母的腿说道：“老太太救我！我南边是死也不去的。况且有了继母，又不是我的亲娘，我是情愿跟着老太太一块儿的。”但见贾母呆着脸儿笑道：“这个不干我的事。”黛玉哭道：“老太太，这是什么事呢。”老太太道：“续弦也好，倒多得一副妆奁。”黛玉哭道：“我在老太太跟前，决不使这里分外的闲钱，只求老太太救我！”贾母道：“不中用了。做了女人，总是要出嫁的。你孩子家不知道，在此地终非了局。”黛玉道：“我在这里，情愿自己做个奴婢过活，自做自吃，也是愿意。只求老太太作主。”见贾母总不言语，黛玉又抱着贾母哭道：“老太太！你向来最是慈悲的，又最疼我的，到了紧急的时候儿，怎么全不管？你别说我是你的外孙女儿，是隔了一层了，我的娘是你的亲生女儿，看我娘分上，也该护庇些。”说着，撞在怀里痛哭。听见贾母道：“鸳鸯，你来送姑娘出去歇歇，我被他闹乏了。”\n　　黛玉情知不是路了，求去无用，不如寻个自尽，站起来，往外就走。深痛自己没有亲娘，便是外祖母与舅母妹妹们，平时何等待的好，可见都是假的。又一想：“今日怎么独不见宝玉？或见他一面，他还有法儿。”便见宝玉站在面前，笑嘻嘻的道：“妹妹大喜呀。”黛玉听了这一句话，越发急了，也顾不得什么了，把宝玉紧紧的拉住，说：“好宝玉！我今日才知道你是个无情无义的人了！”宝玉道：“我怎么无情无义？你既有了人家儿，咱们各自干各自的了。”黛玉越听越气，越没了主意，只得拉着宝玉哭道：“好哥哥！你叫我跟了谁去？”宝玉道：“你要不去，就在这里住着，你原是许了我的，所以你才到我们这里来。我待你是怎么样的？你也想想。”黛玉恍惚又象果曾许过宝玉的，心内忽又转悲作喜，问宝玉道：“我是死活打定主意的了，你到底叫我去不去？”宝玉道：“我说叫你住下。你不信我的话，你就瞧瞧我的心！”说着，就拿着一把小刀子往胸口上一划，只见鲜血直流。黛玉吓得魂飞魄散，忙用手握着宝玉的心窝，哭道：“你怎么做出这个事来？你先来杀了我罢！”宝玉道：“不怕，我拿我的心给你瞧。”还把手在划开的地方儿乱抓。黛玉又颤又哭，又怕人撞破，抱住宝玉痛哭。宝玉道：“不好了。我的心没有了，活不得了！”说着，眼睛往上一翻，“咕咚”就倒了。\n　　黛玉拼命放声大哭。只听见紫鹃叫道：“姑娘，姑娘，怎么魇住了？快醒醒儿，脱了衣服睡罢。”黛玉一翻身，却原来是一场恶梦。喉间犹是哽咽，心上还是乱跳，枕头上已经湿透，肩背身心，但觉冰冷。想了一回，“父母死的久了，和宝玉尚未放定，这是从那里说起？”又想梦中光景，无倚无靠，再真把宝玉死了，那可怎么样好？一时痛定思痛，神魂俱乱。又哭了一回。遍身微微的出了一点儿汗。扎挣起来，把外罩大袄脱了，叫紫鹃盖好了被窝，又躺下去。翻来覆去那里睡得着，只听得外面淅淅飒飒，又象风声又象雨声。又停了一会子，又听得远远的吆呼声儿，却是紫鹃已在那里睡着，鼻息出入之声。自己扎挣着爬起来，围着被坐了一会，觉得窗缝里透进一缕冷风来，吹得寒毛直竖，便又躺下。正要朦胧睡去，听得竹枝上不知有多少家雀儿的声儿，啾揪唧唧叫个不住。那窗上的纸，隔着屉子，渐浙的透进清光来。\n　　黛玉此已醒得双眸炯炯，一会儿咳嗽起来，连紫鹃都咳嗽醒了。紫鹃道：“姑娘，你还没睡着么？又咳嗽起来了。想是着了风了，这会儿窗户纸发清了，也待好亮起来了。歇歇儿罢，养养神，别尽着想长想短的了。”黛玉道：“我何尝不要睡，只是睡不着，你睡你的罢。”说了又嗽起来。紫鹃见黛玉这般光景，心中也自伤感，睡不着了。听见黛玉又嗽，连忙起来，捧着痰盒。这时天已亮了。黛玉道：“你不睡了么？”紫鹃笑道：“天都亮了，还睡什么呢。”黛玉道：“既这样，你就把痰盒儿换了罢。”紫鹃答应着，忙出来换了一个痰盒儿，将手里的这个盒儿放在桌上，开了套间门出来，仍旧带上门，放下撒花软帘，出来叫醒雪雁。开了屋门去倒那盒子时，只见满盒子痰，痰中有些血星。唬了紫鹃一跳，不觉失声道：“嗳哟，这还了得！”黛玉里面接着问：“是什么？”紫鹃自知失言，连忙改说道：“手里一滑，几乎撂了痰盒子。”黛玉道：“不是盒子里的痰有了什么？”紫鹃道：“没有什么。”说着这句话时，心中一酸，那眼泪直流下来，声儿早已岔了。\n　　黛玉因为喉间有些甜腥，早自疑惑，方才听见紫鹃在外边诧异，这会子又听见紫鹃说话声音带着悲惨的光景，心中觉了八九分，便叫紫鹃：“进来罢，外头看冷着。”紫鹃答应了一声，这一声更比头里凄惨，竟是鼻中酸楚之音。黛玉听了，冷了半截。看紫鹃推门进来时，尚拿绢子试眼。黛玉道：“大清早起，好好的为什么哭？”紫鹃勉强笑道：“谁哭来？这早起起来，眼睛里有些不舒服。姑娘今夜大概比往常醒的时候更大罢？我听见咳嗽了半夜。”黛玉道：“可不是？越要睡越睡不着。”紫鹃道：“姑娘身上不大好，依我说，还得自己开解着些。身子是根本，俗语说的：‘留得青山在，依旧有柴烧。’况这里自老太太，太太起，那个不疼姑娘？”只这一句话，又勾起黛玉的梦来，觉得心里一撞，眼中一黑，神色俱变。紫鹃连忙端着痰盒，雪雁捶着脊梁，半日才吐出一口痰来，痰中一缕紫血，簌簌乱跳。紫鹃、雪雁脸都吓黄了。两个旁边守着，黛玉便昏昏躺下。紫鹃看着不好，连忙努嘴叫雪雁叫人去。\n　　雪雁才出屋门，只见翠缕、翠墨两个人笑嘻嘻的走来。翠缕便道：“林姑娘怎么这早晚还不出门？我们姑娘和三姑娘都在四姑娘屋里，讲究四姑娘画的那张园子景儿呢。”雪雁连忙摆手儿。翠缕、翠墨二人倒都吓了一跳，说：“这是什么原故？”雪雁将方才的事一一告诉他二人。二人都吐了吐舌头儿，说：“这可不是玩的。你们怎么不告诉老太太去？这还了得，你们怎么这么糊涂？”雪雁道：“我这里才要去，你们就来了。”正说着，只听紫鹃叫道：“谁在外头说话？姑娘问呢。”三个人连忙一齐进来。翠缕、翠墨见黛玉盖着被，躺在床上，见了他二人，便说道：“谁告诉你们了，你们这样大惊小怪的？”翠墨道：“我们姑娘和云姑娘才都在四姑娘屋里，讲究四姑娘画的那张园子图儿，我们来请姑娘。不知道姑娘身上又欠安了。”黛玉道：“也不是什么大病，不过觉身子略软些，躺躺儿就起来了。你回去告诉三姑娘和云姑娘，饭后若无事，倒是请他们勿这里坐坐罢。宝二爷没到你们那边去？”二人答道：“没有。”翠墨又道：“宝二爷这两天上了学了，老爷天天要查功课，那里还能象从前那么乱跑呢。”黛玉听了，默然不言。二人又略站了一回，都悄悄的退出来了。\n　　且说探春、湘云正在惜春那边评论惜春所画《大观园图》，说这个多一点，那个少一点；这个太疏，那个太密。大家又议着题诗，着人去请黛玉商议。正说着，忽见翠缕、翠墨二人回来，神色匆忙。湘云便先问道：“林姑娘怎么不来？”翠缕道：“林姑娘昨日夜里又犯了病了，咳嗽了一夜。我们听见雪雁说，吐了一盒子痰血。”探春听了，诧异道：“这话真么？”翠缕道：“怎么不真？”翠墨道：“我们刚才进去去瞧了瞧，颜色不成颜色，说话儿的气力儿都微了。”湘云道：“不好的这么着，怎么还能说话呢？”探春道：“怎么你这么糊涂，不能说话，不是已经……”说到这里，却咽住了。惜春道：“林姐姐那样一个聪明人，我看他总有些瞧不破，一点半点儿都要认起真来。天下事那里有多少真的呢。”探春道：“既这么着，咱们都过去看看。倘若病的利害，咱们也过去告诉大嫂子回老太太，传大夫进来瞧瞧，也得个主意。”湘云道：“正是这样。”惜春道：“姐姐们先去，我回来再过去。”\n于是探春、湘云扶了小丫头，都到潇湘馆来。进入房中，黛玉见他二人，不免又伤起心来。因又转念想起梦中，“连老太太尚且如此，何况他们？况且我不请他们，他们还不来呢！”心里虽是如此，脸上却碍不过去，只得勉强令紫鹃扶起，口中让坐。探春、湘云都坐在床沿上，一头一个，看了黛玉这般光景，也自伤感。探春便道：“姐姐怎么身上又不舒服了？”黛玉道：“也没什么要紧，只是身子软得很。”紫鹃在黛玉身后，偷偷的用手指那痰盒儿。湘云到底年轻，性情又兼直爽，伸手便把痰盒拿起来看。不看则已，看了吓的惊疑不止，说：“这是姐姐吐的？这还了得！”初时黛玉昏昏沉沉，吐了也没细看，此时见湘云这么说，回头看时，自己早已灰了一半。探春见湘云冒失，连忙解说道：“这不过是肺火上炎，带出一半点来，也是常事。偏是云丫头，不拘什么，就这样蝎蝎螫螫的！”湘云红了脸，自悔失言。探春见黛玉精神短少，似有烦倦之意，连忙起身说道：“姐姐静静的养养神罢。我们回来再瞧你。”黛玉道：“累你二位惦着。”探春又嘱咐紫鹃：“好生留神伏侍姑娘。”紫鹃答应着。探春才要走，只听外面一个人嚷起来。\n未知是谁，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After school Baoyu went to pay his respects to the Lady Dowager. She greeted him with a smile.\n\n“Good! So now the wild horse is bridled. You can go and pay your respects to your father and amuse yourself for a bit.”\n\nBaoyu assented and went to see his father.\n\n“Back from school so early?” asked Jia Zheng. “Has your teacher set you your course of study?”\n\n“Yes. I’m to review the texts in the morning, write characters after breakfast, and at noon listen to expoundings of the texts and practise writing essays.”\n\nJia Zheng nodded.\n\n“Off you go then,” he said. “Go and keep your grandmother company for a while. You should learn the principles of human conduct, not just amuse yourself all the time. Go to bed early and get up early to go to school each day. Do you hear?”\n\nBaoyu assented repeatedly and withdrew. He hurried next to pay his respects to his mother, then went back to the Lady Dowager’s apartment to report. After that he rushed out, wishing with every step he took that he could fly to Bamboo Lodge.\n\nHe entered clapping his hands and crying, “I’m back again!”\n\nDaiyu gave a start. As Zijuan raised the portiere he went in and sat down.\n\n“I heard you’d started school,” she said. “How is it you’re back so early?”\n\n“Ah, don’t speak of it!” he exclaimed. “Just because my father sent for me today to go to school, I felt cut off from all of you. It seemed as if we wouldn’t be meeting for years. Now that I’ve survived this one day and can see you again, it’s like being born again. How true the old saying is: ‘One day apart seems three autumns.’ “\n\n“Have you called on the old lady and your parents?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Anyone else?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You should go to see the others.”\n\n“I can’t be bothered now. I just want to sit and have a little chat with you, cousin, before I turn in early as my father said. I can call on the others tomorrow.”\n\n“Sit down for a while, then. You must be tired.”\n\n“I’m not tired, just bored. Now that I’m sitting here with you I feel better, and you tell me to rest!”\n\nDaiyu gave a little laugh.\n\n“Zijuan,” she called, “make the young master a cup of Dragon Well tea. He’s studying now, not like before.”\n\nZijuan laughingly assented and went to fetch the tea, telling a young maid to make it.\n\n“Don’t talk about studying!” cried Baoyu. “I can’t stand that moralistic talk. And those ridiculous eight-legged essays! It’s bad enough to use them to win an official post and make a living, but they actually claim they’re ‘expounding the wisdom of the sages.’ Some of them are just a hotch-potch of classical allusions; others have no substance at all but string phrases together nonsensically, and boast about their erudition. Is that expounding the wisdom of the sages? My father keeps dinning it into my ears that I must study, but I daren’t argue with him. So don’t you talk about it too.”\n\n“Well, we girls don’t need that sort of learning, but when I studied as a child with your cousin Jia Yucun I read some essays. Some were reasonable and some rather subtle and refined. Though I didn’t understand them too well then, I could see that they had good points — you mustn’t dismiss them all. And if you want to win an official post, this is the more honourable way.”\n\nThis jarred on Baoyu’s ears. He had never known Daiyu talk so vulgarly. He could not rebut her to her face, however, and simply snorted.\n\nJust then they heard two people talking outside. It was Qiuwen and Zijuan.\n\n“I’ve been sent by Xiren to fetch him from the old lady’s place,” said Qiuwen. “Fancy finding him here.”\n\nJust then they had tea ready, so let him have a cup before he goes.” With that the two of them came in together.\n\n“I’m just coming,” Baoyu told Qiuwen with a smile. “Sorry to have made you fetch me.”\n\nBefore she could answer, Zijuan said, “Do drink your tea quickly. Someone has been waiting all day to see you.”\n\nQiuwen spat in disgust. “For shame, you bitch! What a thing to say!”\n\nThis set them all laughing. Baoyu stood up and took his leave. Daiyu saw him to the door, and Zijuan stood at the foot of the steps until he had gone, then went back inside.\n\nBut let us return to Baoyu. Upon reaching Happy Red Court he went inside, where Xiren came out from the inner room to meet him.\n\n“So you’re back,” she said.\n\n“The young master came back some time ago,” Qiuwen answered for him. “He was with Miss Lin.”\n\n“Have you anything to do today?” he asked.\n\n“No, but just now Her Ladyship sent Yuanyang over with orders that, as the master is determined to make you study, if any of the maids dare play about with you again they’re to be punished like Qingwen and Siqi. After all my years of looking after you, to be told such a thing is most upsetting.” She began to cry.\n\n“Don’t worry, dear sister,” he said quickly. “I’ll study hard so that she won’t scold you again. I must do some reading tonight because the tutor’s going to test me tomorrow. If I want anything, I’ll ask Sheyue or Qiuwen. You go and rest.”\n\n“If you’re really willing to study, we’ll be only too glad to look after you.”\n\nAfter a hasty supper he called for a lamp and took out the Four Books he had read. But where to start? He leafed through one. Each section seemed intelligible enough, yet when he thought them over carefully he found them rather confusing. He read the commentaries and some expositions, but by the time the first watch was sounded he was still perplexed.\n\n“I find poetry so easy, but this has me stumped,” he thought, sitting there in a daze.\n\n“Why not take a rest?” suggested Xiren. “You can’t do it all in one day.”\n\nHe mumbled some reply. Sheyue and Xiren helped him to bed and then retired themselves. But when they woke from their first sleep they heard him still tossing and turning.\n\n“Are you awake?” asked Xiren. “Do stop worrying and have a good sleep to refresh your mind for tomorrow’s study.”\n\n“I know, but I can’t sleep. Come and take off one of my coverlets.”\n\n“It’s not hot. You’d better keep them on.”\n\n“I’m so fidgety I feel stifled.” He pushed down his coverlet himself.\n\nXiren promptly reached out to stop him and felt his forehead. It was slightly feverish.\n\n“Don’t move,” she said. “You have a temperature.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“What’s to be done?”\n\n“It’s all right. It’s just because I’m upset. Don’t make a fuss, for if the master hears he’ll say I’m shamming to get out of going to school. Otherwise, why should I fall ill so conveniently? If I’m all right tomorrow I’ll go — that’s the way to avoid trouble.”\n\nFeeling sorry for him she said, “I’ll sleep next to you.” She massaged his back for a time, and without knowing it they both fell asleep.\n\nThe sun was high in the sky when they woke.\n\n“This is bad. I’m late,” exclaimed Baoyu.\n\nHe washed and dressed in a hurry, then went to pay his respects to his father.\n\nJia Dairu in the school was scowling.\n\n“No wonder your father’s angry and says you’re good-for-nothing,” he growled. “The second day, you come late again. What’s the meaning of this?”\n\nBaoyu told him that he had been feverish the previous evening and was excused. Then he started reciting his lessons. That afternoon the tutor said, “Baoyu, I have a passage here....”\n\n\"Now tell me what this book says.\" Pao-yu stepped forward and saw that the text was the chapter entitled \"Youth is a Time for Fear.\" \"Not too bad!\" he thought. \"Lucky it isn't from the Great Learning or the Doctrine of the Mean.\"\n\n\"How do you explain it?\" asked Tai-ju.\n\n\"Tell me the meaning of the text in detail.\"\n\nPao-yu read the chapter aloud, then said, \"This chapter exhorts the young to work hard in good time, so as not to fritter away....\" He broke off and looked up at Tai-ju.\n\nThe old man smiled.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said. \"In expounding a text there's no need to be inhibited. As the Book of Rites says, 'In a text avoid what is taboo.' So out with it. What shouldn't we fritter away?\"\n\n\"Shouldn't fritter away our youth so that we accomplish nothing in old age. The sage first uses the words 'is a time for fear' to arouse the young, then the words 'is not a time for fear' to caution them against the future.\" He looked at Tai-ju for his reaction.\n\n\"Not bad,\" said the tutor. \"Now expound it more fully.\"\n\n\"The sage says that when young a man has intelligence and ability, is clever and competent in every way. That is truly frightening, for who can guarantee that in later life he won't turn out like me today? If he fritters away his time till he's forty or fifty, without winning any distinction, then no matter how promising he seemed as a youth, by that time no one will be afraid of him.\"\n\n\"You've explained the meaning clearly enough,\" said Tai-ju with a smile. \"But your language is rather childish. The phrase 'without winning distinction' doesn't mean failing to become an official. 'Distinction' means being truly versed in reason and the Way. Even without becoming an official, a man can win distinction. Otherwise, were the sages and worthies of old who lived in retirement unknown? Can it be that they won no distinction because they were not officials? 'Is not a time for fear' means that a man can be written off, as is shown by the word 'know' in the phrase 'who can know.' It is not a question of being afraid. You must show that you understand this subtle distinction.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Pao-yu.\n\n\"Now expound another chapter for me.\" Tai-ju turned back a page and pointed it out. Pao-yu saw that it was the passage: \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" This embarrassed him and he said with an apologetic smile:\n\n\"There's nothing to be said about this.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! If this were the subject set in the examination, would you say there was nothing to write?\"\n\nPao-yu had to comply. \"The sage lamented the fact that men do not love virtue, but are inordinately fond of beauty,\" he expounded. \"Actually, virtue is innate, yet men do not love it. As for beauty, although that is innate too and all men love it, virtue is heavenly reason whereas beauty is human desire. So how can men love heavenly reason as much as human desire? Though Confucius was lamenting this, he was also hoping that men might reform. Besides, some men do love virtue, but only in a superficial way; they should love it as much as they love beauty — that would be true love.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Tai-ju. \"But let me ask you this: since you understand the sage's meaning, why do you commit both these errors? Although I haven't been home and your father hasn't told me, I know quite well what your trouble is. As a human being, why don't you try to make progress? Now that you are 'a youth to be regarded with respect,' whether you 'win distinction' or are 'not worth regarding' depends entirely on yourself. I shall set you essays every month from now on, and if you are lazy I shall certainly not let you off. You know the saying: 'Adults must suffer, without suffering they don't grow up.' Bear that carefully in mind.\"\n\nPao-yu had to agree. And after this he had to study his lessons every day.\n\nBut let us return to Baoyu. After he started school, Happy Red Court was very quiet and Xi-ren was able to do some work. She took up her needlework to embroider a betelnut bag, thinking that now that Baoyu was occupied with his lessons the maids would have no more trouble. If only this had happened earlier, Qing-wen need not have come to such a bad end. The thought of this filled her with melancholy. Then she thought of her own future. She was not Baoyu’s proper wife but only a concubine; and though he himself was easy to handle, if he married a shrew she might end like Second Sister You or Xiang-ling. From the way the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang dropped hints, and from Xifeng’s remarks too, it looked as if his wife would certainly be Dai-yu. And Dai-yu was so suspicious. At this point Xi-ren flushed and grew quite hot, so that she stuck her needle in the wrong place. She put down her work and went to sound Dai-yu out.\n\nDai-yu was reading when Xi-ren called. She made her sit down.\n\n“Are you better these last few days, miss?” asked Xi-ren.\n\n“Not really. Only a little better. What have you been doing at home?”\n\n“Now that Master Bao’s at school, there’s nothing to do in our rooms; so I came to see you and have a chat.”\n\nAs she spoke, Zijuan brought in tea and Xi-ren promptly stood up.\n\n“Do sit down, sister,” she said. “I heard from Qiu-wen the other day that you’d been talking about me behind my back.”\n\n“Don’t you believe her,” rejoined Zijuan with a smile. “I said that now Master Bao’s at school and Miss Baochai’s left the Garden, with even Xiang-ling not coming over any more, you must be feeling very bored.”\n\n“Don’t talk about Xiang-ling!” cried Xi-ren. “She’s having a terrible time. Fancy being up against that ‘tyrant’! How does she stand it?” She held up two fingers. “They say this one’s even worse. She doesn’t care about losing face outside either.”\n\n“She’s had more than enough,” said Dai-yu. “Look how Second Sister You died!”\n\n“Yes. You’d think we’re all human beings, even if there is some difference in status; why should she be so cruel? It gives her a bad name.”\n\nDai-yu had never heard Xi-ren criticize anyone behind her back before. These remarks set her thinking.\n\n“It’s hard to say,” she answered. “In every family, if the east wind doesn’t prevail over the west wind, then the west wind is bound to prevail over the east wind.”\n\n“As a concubine, you feel too diffident to bully anyone,” sighed Xi-ren.\n\nJust then an old woman came into the courtyard and asked, “Is this where Miss Lin lives? Which of you young ladies is in charge here?”\n\nXueyan went out and saw that she looked like one of Aunt Xue’s servants.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\n“Our young lady has sent me to bring Miss Lin something.”\n\n“Wait a minute.”\n\nXueyan went in to tell Dai-yu, who told her to bring the woman in. The old woman came in to pay her respects but, instead of announcing her errand at once, she eyed Dai-yu intently until the girl felt quite embarrassed.\n\n“What has Miss Baochai sent me?” she asked.\n\nThe woman smiled. “My young lady has sent you a jar of preserved lichees.” Then, catching sight of Xi-ren, she asked, “Aren’t you Miss Hua from Master Bao’s place?”\n\nXi-ren smiled. “How do you know me, nanny?”\n\n“I only look after the house for the mistress, and don’t often go out with her or the young ladies, so I don’t know all of you. But when you call on us, we have a vague recollection of you.”\n\nShe handed the jar to Xueyan.\n\nShe turned to look at Dai-yu then and said with a smile to Aroma, ‘No wonder our mistress says Miss Lin and Master Bao would make a perfect match. She’s a real angel, isn’t she!’ Aroma, shocked at this indiscretion, hastily interposed:\n\n‘You must be tired, nanny. Sit down and have some tea.’\n\n‘I must be getting back,’ said the old woman with a grin. ‘We’ve ever so much to do, getting Miss Bao-qin ready for her wedding. She sent me over with these two bottles of lichees for Master Bao.’\n\nShe took her leave and hobbled out. Dai-yu was extremely annoyed by her familiarity, but as she was an emissary from Bao-chai, there was nothing she could do about it. Only when she had left the room did Dai-yu say:\n\n‘Please thank your young mistress for me.’\n\nThe old woman could be heard muttering to herself as she went:\n\n‘Such a beautiful young lady! No one but Bao-yu is worthy of her…’\n\nDai-yu pretended not to hear. Aroma laughed.\n\n‘What is it about old people that makes them so dreadfully outspoken? It’s both irritating and funny.’\n\nSnowgoose brought in the bottles for Dai-yu to inspect.\n\n‘I don’t feel like eating any,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Put them away.’\n\nAroma stayed a little longer, and then left.\n\nThat evening, when Dai-yu had finished her toilet and was about to retire for the night, she happened to glance up and catch sight of the bottles of lichees. They reminded her of the old woman’s tactless remarks, which now seemed to stab her to the heart. In the silence and solitude of the gathering dusk, a host of sad thoughts crowded into her mind. She was in poor health and getting older. Although she knew that Bao-yu had no eyes for anyone else, her grandmother and Lady Wang had given no indication whatsoever of their intentions. How she hated her parents for not having betrothed her to Bao-yu while they were still alive! But then again, if they had lived, they might well have betrothed her to someone else. Who could say that she would ever have found another cousin Bao-yu, another kindred spirit? Perhaps the present situation was for the best after all. Her thoughts chased one another in dizzying circles, like a winch on a well. She sighed, and a few tears rolled down her cheeks. Listless and disconsolate, she lay down in her clothes.\n\nSuddenly one of the junior maids came in to announce:\n\n‘Mr Jia Yu-cun is outside, and wishes to see you, miss.’\n\n‘Although I studied under him,’ thought Dai-yu to herself, ‘I am a girl, and he has no reason to see me. Besides, he and my uncle are acquainted, and have had dealings with one another, and he has never asked to see me before. There is no need for me to receive him now.’\n\nShe told the maid to inform him that she was unwell and unable to receive visitors, and to convey her apologies.\n\n‘He probably wants to congratulate you, miss,’ said the maid. ‘Someone has come from Nanking to fetch you.’\n\nAs she said this, she was joined by Xi-feng, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Bao-chai and several others, who crowded into the room with smiling faces.\n\n‘We have come both to congratulate you and to say goodbye!’ they cried.\n\nDai-yu was horrified.\n\n‘What do you mean?’ she asked.\n\n‘Why pretend you don’t know?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Your father has been promoted to Grain Intendant of Hupeh. He has married a new wife and is wonderfully happy. He thinks it improper to leave you here, and has asked Yu-cun to act as go-between and arrange a match for you with one of your stepmother’s relatives. They say it’s a second marriage. So someone has been sent to take you home. They expect you to be married as soon as you arrive. It’s all your stepmother’s idea. And because they are afraid you might not be looked after properly on the journey, your Cousin Lian has been asked to see you home.’\n\nDai-yu broke into a cold sweat. She seemed to remember her father holding some such official post. Her heart was thumping wildly, but she forced herself to reply:\n\n‘You’re making it all up! It’s just one of Xi-feng’s horrible jokes!’\n\nShe saw Lady Xing wink at Lady Wang. They both rose to leave.\n\n‘She still doesn’t believe us. Come along.’\n\nDai-yu’s eyes were full of tears.\n\n‘Please stay a little, aunties!’ she pleaded.\n\nBut they ignored her and left, laughing coldly.\n\nDai-yu was in an agony of despair, but could give no expression to her feelings. She was sobbing and choking, when suddenly she found herself back with Grandmother Jia.\n\nShe told herself, “My only hope is to beg the old lady to save me.” She threw herself on her knees before the Lady Dowager and, clinging to her legs, sobbed:\n\n“Save me, madam! I’d rather die than go back south. Besides, I have a stepmother now, not my own mother. Do let me stay with you!”\n\nThe old lady’s face was stony.\n\n“That’s no business of mine,” she said.\n\n“What do you mean, madam?” Daiyu wept.\n\n“It’s not a bad thing, marrying a second wife. You’ll get an extra trousseau.”\n\n“I promise not to be any extra expense if I stay with you. Please save me, madam!”\n\n“There’s no help for it. All girls have to marry when they grow up. You’re still a child, you don’t understand. You can’t stay here all your life.”\n\n“I’ll work for my keep as a servant here. I’ll do all my own work and pay my own way — anything, if only you’ll let me stay!”\n\nAs the Lady Dowager said nothing, Daiyu embraced her and wept.\n\n“You’ve always been so kind and you’ve always loved me best, madam,” she cried. “Why will you do nothing for me now, in this crisis? Even if I’m only your grand-daughter, not as close as a daughter, my mother was your own child; for her sake, please take pity on me!” She threw herself sobbing into the old lady’s arms.\n\nBut she heard her say, “Yuan-yang, take Miss Lin out to rest. I’m worn out by her.”\n\nDaiyu knew then that all was lost. There was no point in pleading further; she must find some way to kill herself. She stood up and started out, thinking bitterly that she had no mother of her own. Her grandmother, aunts and cousins had always been so good to her, but it was all a sham. Then it struck her: Why hadn’t Baoyu come today? If she could see him, he might have some way out.\n\nAnd there was Baoyu standing before her, smiling.\n\n“My congratulations, cousin!” he said.\n\nThis made her more frantic than ever. Forgetting all propriety, she seized hold of him.\n\n“Fine!” she cried. “Now I know how heartless you are.”\n\n“Why am I heartless? You’re engaged to someone else, so we’d better go our different ways.”\n\nMore angry and desperate than ever, she clung to him weeping.\n\n“Dear cousin, who do you want me to go to?” she sobbed.\n\n“If you don’t want to go, you can stay here. You were originally promised to me — that’s why you came here in the first place. I’ve always known how you felt. You should think how I feel.”\n\nDaiyu in her confusion seemed to remember that this was indeed the case. Her grief turned to joy.\n\n“I’ve made up my mind to die,” she told him. “But tell me honestly: do you want me to go or to stay?”\n\n“I want you to stay. If you don’t believe me, I’ll show you my heart.”\n\nHe snatched a knife and slashed open his chest. Blood came gushing out. Daiyu, terrified, tried to staunch the blood with her hands.\n\n“How could you do such a thing?” she cried. “You’d better kill me first.”\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I’m going to take out my heart to show you.”\n\nHe fumbled at the gaping wound. With a shriek, Daiyu hugged him tightly and wept, afraid someone might come in and see them.\n\n“I’m done for!” he cried. “Now that I’ve lost my heart I must die.” He rolled his eyes and slumped to the ground.\n\nDaiyu gave a piercing cry. Then she heard Zijuan calling:\n\n“Miss! Miss! You’re having a nightmare. Wake up and undress before you go properly to sleep.”\n\nDaiyu turned over and woke up to find it had all been a dream. Her throat was still choked with sobs and her heart was still racing.\n\nHer pillow was soaked, and she felt chilled to the bone both in body and heart. She reflected, “My parents have long since died, and though Baoyu and I are not yet betrothed, how can I have such dreams?” The wretchedness of her dream, in which she had had no one to turn to, made her think, “If Baoyu were really to die, what use would there be in my living on?” This thought so agitated her that she gave way to a fresh storm of weeping. Soon her whole body was covered with a light sweat. Struggling up she took off her outer gown and told Zijuan to tuck in the quilt; then she lay down again.\n\nBut though she tossed and turned she could not sleep. The rustling outside sounded like wind or rain. After a while she heard in the distance what seemed to be a shout, but Zijuan was already asleep and breathing evenly. With an effort she sat up, huddled in her quilt, until a draught of cold air through the chink of the window made her shiver and lie down again. As she was dozing off, she heard what sounded like a flock of sparrows chirping on the bamboos. Then through the window paper the dawn light slowly stole.\n\nBy now Daiyu’s eyes were wide open. She started coughing again, and this woke Zijuan.\n\n“Haven’t you slept yet, miss?” she asked. “You’re coughing again? I’m afraid you may have caught a chill. It’s light already — you’d better rest and try to sleep instead of worrying.”\n\n“I’d like to sleep but I can’t,” said Daiyu. “You can go back to sleep.” She was seized by another fit of coughing.\n\nZijuan was so distressed to see her in this state that she could not sleep either. Hearing her cough again, she hastily got up and brought her the spittoon. By now it was light.\n\n“Aren’t you going to sleep?” asked Daiyu.\n\n“It’s light. What’s the use of sleeping?” Zijuan smiled.\n\n“In that case, change the spittoon.”\n\n“Yes, miss.”\n\nZijuan went out to fetch a clean spittoon, leaving the used one on the table. She opened the door of the inner room, closed it behind her and let down the flowered portiere before going to wake Xueyan. She opened the door of the outer room to empty the spittoon, and was aghast to see that it was full of phlegm mixed with blood.\n\n“Heavens!” she exclaimed in dismay.\n\n“What is it?” Daiyu called from inside.\n\nRealizing that she had given herself away, Zijuan changed her tune.\n\n“I nearly dropped the spittoon — that gave me a start,” she answered. “It’s nothing, miss.”\n\nBut as she said this her heart failed her and she broke down, her voice choking with tears.\n\nNow Daiyu, because of the sweet, sickly taste in her throat, had already guessed the truth. Zijuan’s exclamation and now the distress in her voice confirmed her fears. She called her in, warning her not to catch cold outside.\n\nZijuan answered with a sob, and the despair in her voice made Daiyu’s heart turn cold. When the maid came in, she was wiping her eyes with her handkerchief.\n\n“Why are you crying so early in the morning?” Daiyu asked.\n\n“Who’s crying?” Zijuan forced a smile. “My eyes itched first thing this morning. You must have been awake much longer than usual, miss, I heard you coughing half the night.”\n\n“Yes, the more I wanted to sleep the wider awake I was.”\n\n“You’re not well, miss. If you’ll take my advice, you should try to look on the bright side. Health is what counts. As the proverb says, ‘As long as the mountain’s there we shan’t lack fuel.’ And here\n\nLady Wang rose to her feet. “Which of us doesn’t love the child?” she asked.\n\nThis remark brought back to Daiyu’s mind the dream she had had, and she felt a constriction in her heart, a dizzy darkness before her eyes, and her face changed colour. Zijuan hurried over with the spittoon, and Xueyan pounded her on the back until, after some time, she brought up a mouthful of phlegm in which was a streak of purple blood, palpitating. Both maids were consternated. As they stood supporting her on either side, she slumped back limply. Zijuan, seeing how bad she looked, made a sign to Xueyan to go for help.\n\nXueyan had just reached the door when she saw Cuilu and Cuimo approaching, laughing. Cuilu called out:\n\n“Why hasn’t Miss Lin come out yet? Our young lady and Miss Tanchun are in Miss Xichun’s room discussing the painting she’s done of the Garden.”\n\nXueyan hastily waved them silent. They asked in surprise, “What’s the matter?”\n\nShe told them what had happened, at which they stuck out their tongues in dismay.\n\n“This is no joke!” they exclaimed. “Why didn’t you report it to the old lady? How awful! How could you be so silly?”\n\n“I was just on my way when you turned up,” said Xueyan.\n\nAs they were speaking Zijuan called from inside, “Who’s that talking outside? The young lady wants to know.”\n\nThe three of them went in together then. Cuilu and Cuimo saw Daiyu lying on her bed under the covers.\n\n“Who told you?” she asked them. “That you come in such consternation?”\n\nCuimo answered, “Miss Tanchun and Miss Xiangyun are in Miss Xichun’s room discussing the painting she’s done of the Garden. We came to invite you to join them, not knowing that you were unwell again, miss.”\n\n“It’s nothing serious, I just feel rather limp and shall get up after resting a little. You can tell the other two young ladies that if they’re free after their meal, I’d like them to come and chat here. Has Master Bao been over there?”\n\n“No,” they said.\n\nCuimo added, “Master Bao has started school these last couple of days. The master checks his homework every day, so he can’t run around as wildly as before.”\n\nDaiyu said nothing to this. After standing there for a little while the two girls quietly withdrew.\n\nMeanwhile Tanchun and Xiangyun were in Xichun’s room critizing her painting of Prospect Garden, saying there was too much here, too little there; this was too sparse, that too crowded. They were also discussing what poems to write on it, and had sent to invite Daiyu to join in their discussion. Now Cuilu and Cuimo came back, both looking flustered.\n\nXiangyun asked first, “Why hasn’t Cousin Lin come?”\n\n“Last night she had another attack and coughed the whole night through,” said Cuilu. “We heard from Xueyan that she brought up a spittoon of phlegm with blood in it.”\n\n“Is that true?” exclaimed Tanchun.\n\n“Of course.”\n\nCuimo put in, “Just now when we went in, her face was drained of colour and she had hardly strength enough to speak.”\n\n“If she’s as bad as that, how could she speak at all?” Xiangyun demanded.\n\n“How stupid you are!” snapped Tanchun. “If she couldn’t speak, that would mean....” She broke off without finishing.\n\nXichun observed, “For all her cleverness, Cousin Lin seems rather narrow-minded. She takes everything too seriously. There aren’t many true things in this world.”\n\n“In that case, let’s all go to see her,” proposed Tanchun. “If she’s really bad, we should tell Madam Zhu to report it to the old lady and send for a doctor to see her and decide what to do.”\n\n“That’s right,” agreed Xiangyun.\n\n“You go first,” said Xichun.\n\n\"I'll come back later to see you.\"\n\nSo Tan-chun and Hsiang-yun, supported by young maids, went to Bamboo Lodge. When they entered the room and Tai-yu saw them, she was again overcome with grief. Then it occurred to her that, judging by her dream, not even the Lady Dowager cared for her, so why should they? Besides, if she had not invited them they would not have come. However, she had to put a good face on it and tell Tzu-chuan to help her sit up, then ask them to be seated.\n\nTan-chun and Hsiang-yun sat on the edge of the bed, one on each side of her, and were most distressed to see how ill she looked.\n\n“Why are you poorly again, cousin?” asked Tan-chun.\n\n“It’s nothing serious,” said Tai-yu. “I’m just feeling rather weak.”\n\nTzu-chuan behind her stealthily pointed at the spittoon. Being young and forthright, Hsiang-yun picked it up to look. The sight horrified her.\n\n“Is this sputum yours, cousin?” she cried. “What a terrible thing!”\n\nTai-yu had been in a daze when she coughed it up and had not examined it. Now that Hsiang-yun had exclaimed in dismay, she looked and saw with consternation that it was streaked with blood.\n\n“That’s nothing,” said Tan-chun, cutting in quickly to cover up Hsiang-yun’s indiscretion. “It’s just because the young lady has too much hot phlegm in her lungs, and has brought up a little blood. But Yun here has to make a great fuss over the least thing.”\n\nHsiang-yun realized that she had been tactless and regretted it. Tan-chun, seeing that Tai-yu looked listless and tired, rose quickly to her feet.\n\n“Do rest and build up your strength, cousin,” she said. “We’ll come back to see you later.”\n\n“I’m sorry to have troubled you both,” replied Tai-yu, and she told Tzu-chuan to see them out. “Do look after your young lady well,” Tan-chun urged Tzu-chuan, who assented.\n\nThey were on the point of leaving when a commotion broke out outside. But who was it that had come?\n\nTo know, read the next chapter."
