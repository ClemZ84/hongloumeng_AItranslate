  "original": "却说黛玉同姐妹们至王夫人处，见王夫人正和兄嫂处的来使计议家务，又说姨母家遭人命官司等语。因见王夫人事情冗杂，姐妹们遂出来，至寡嫂李氏房中来了。原来这李氏即贾珠之妻。珠虽天亡，幸存一子，取名贾兰，今方五岁，已入学攻书。这李氏亦系金陵名宦之女，父名李守中，曾为国子祭酒；族中男女无不读诗书者。至李守中继续以来，便谓“女子无才便是德”，故生了此女不曾叫他十分认真读书，只不过将些《女四书》、《列女传》读读，认得几个字，记得前朝这几个贤女便了。却以纺绩女红为要，因取名为李纨，字宫裁。所以这李纨虽青春丧偶，且居处于膏粱锦绣之中，竟如槁木死灰一般，一概不问不闻，惟知侍亲养子，闲时陪侍小姑等针黹诵读而已。今黛玉虽客居于此，已有这几个姑嫂相伴，除老父之外，馀者也就无用虑了。\n　　如今且说贾雨村授了应天府，一到任就有件人命官司详至案下，却是两家争买一婢，各不相让，以致殴伤人命。彼时雨村即拘原告来审。那原告道：“被打死的乃是小人的主人。因那日买了个丫头，不想系拐子拐来卖的。这拐子先已得了我家的银子，我家小主人原说第三日方是好日，再接入门；这拐子又悄悄的卖与了薛家。被我们知道了，去找拿卖主，夺取丫头。无奈薛家原系金陵一霸，倚财仗势，众豪奴将我小主人竟打死了。凶身主仆已皆逃走，无有踪迹，只剩了几个局外的人。小人告了一年的状，竟无人作主。求太老爷拘拿凶犯，以扶善良，存殁感激大恩不尽！”\n　　雨村听了，大怒道：“那有这等事！打死人竟白白的走了拿不来的？”便发签差公人立刻将凶犯家属拿来拷问。只见案旁站着一个门子，使眼色不叫他发签。雨村心下狐疑，只得停了手。退堂至密室，令从人退去，只留这门子一人伏侍。门子忙上前请安，笑问：“老爷一向加官进禄，八九年来，就忘了我了？”雨村道：“我看你十分眼熟，但一时总想不起来。”门子笑道：“老爷怎么把出身之地竟忘了！老爷不记得当年葫芦庙里的事么？”雨村大惊，方想起往事。原来这门子本是葫芦庙里一个小沙弥，因被火之后无处安身，想这件生意倒还轻省，耐不得寺院凄凉，遂趁年纪轻，蓄了发，充当门子。雨村那里想得是他。便忙携手笑道：“原来还是故人。”因赏他坐了说话。这门子不敢坐，雨村笑道：“你也算贫贱之交了。此系私室，但坐不妨。”门子才斜签着坐下。\n　　雨村道：“方才何故不令发签？”门子道：“老爷荣任到此，难道就没抄一张本省的护官符来不成？”雨村忙问：“何为护官符？”门子道：“如今凡作地方官的，都有一个私单，上面写的是本省最有权势极富贵的大乡绅名姓，各省皆然。倘若不知，一时触犯了这样的人家，不但官爵，只怕连性命也难保呢！所以叫做护官符。方才所说的这薛家，老爷如何惹得他！他这件官司并无难断之处，从前的官府都因碍着情分脸面，所以如此。”一面说，一面从顺袋中取出一张抄的“护官符”来，递与雨村看时，上面皆是本地大族名宦之家的俗谚口碑，云：\n　　　　贾不假，白玉为堂金作马。阿房官，三百里，住不下金陵一个史。东海缺少白玉床，龙王来请金陵王。丰年好大“薛”，珍珠如土金如铁。\n　　雨村尚末看完，忽闻传点，报“王老爷来拜”。雨村忙具衣冠接迎。有顿饭工夫方回来，问这门子，门子道：“四家皆连络有亲，一损俱损，一荣俱荣。今告打死人之薛，就是‘丰年大雪’之薛，—不单靠这三家，他的世交亲友在都在外的本也不少，老爷如今拿谁去？”\n雨村听说，便笑问门子道：“这样说来，却怎么了结此案？你大约也深知这凶犯躲的方向了？”门子笑道：“不瞒老爷说，不但这凶犯躲的方向，并这拐的人我也知道，死鬼买主也深知道，待我细说与老爷听。这个被打死的是一个小乡宦之子，名唤冯渊，父母俱亡，又无兄弟，守着些薄产度日，年纪十八九岁，酷爱男风，不好女色。这也是前生冤孽，可巧遇见这丫头，他便一眼看上了，立意买来作妻，设誓不近男色．也不再娶第二个了。所以郑重其事，必得三日后方进门。谁知这拐子又偷卖与薛家，他意欲卷了两家的银子逃去。谁知又走不脱，两家拿住，打了个半死，都不肯收银，各要领人。那薛公子便喝令下人动手，将冯公子打了个稀烂，抬回去三日竟死了。这薛公子原择下日子要上京的，既打了人夺了丫头，他便没事人一般，只管带了家眷走他的路，并非为此而逃。这人命些些小事，自有他弟兄奴仆在此料理。这且别说，老爷可知这被卖的丫头是谁？”雨村道：“我如何晓得？”门子冷笑道：“这人还是老爷的大恩人呢！他就是葫芦庙旁住的甄老爷的女儿，小名英莲的。”雨村骇然道：“原来是他！听见他自五岁被人拐去，怎么如今才卖呢？”门子道：“这种拐子单拐幼女，养至十二三岁，带至他乡转卖。当日这英莲，我们天天哄他玩耍，极相熟的，所以隔了七八年，虽模样儿出脱的齐整，然大段未改，所以认得，且他眉心中原有米粒大的一点胭脂，从胎里带来的。偏这拐子又租了我的房子居住。那日拐子不在家，我也曾问他，他说是打怕了的，万不敢说，只说拐子是他的亲爹，因无钱还债才卖的。再四哄他，他又哭了，只说：‘原不记得小时的事。’这无可疑了。那日冯公子相见了，兑了银子，因拐子醉了，英莲自叹说：‘我今日罪孽可满了！’后又听见三日后才过门，他又转有忧愁之态。我又不忍，等拐子出去，又叫内人去解劝他：‘这冯公必待好日期来接，可知必不以丫鬟相看。况他是个绝风流人品，家里颇过得，素性又最厌恶堂客，今竟破价买你，后事不言可知。只耐得三两日，何必忧闷？’他听如此说方略解些，自卫从此得所，谁料天下竞有不如意事，第二日，他偏又卖与薛家！若卖与第二家还好，这薛公子的混名，人称他‘呆霸王’，最是天下第一个弄性尚气的人，而且使钱如土。只打了个落花流水，生拖死拽把个英莲拖去，如今也不知死活。这冯公子空喜一场，一念未遂，反花了钱，送了命，岂不可叹！”\n　　雨村听了，也叹道：“这也是他们的孽障遭遇，亦非偶然，不然这冯渊如何偏只看上了这英莲？这英莲受了拐子这几年折磨，才得了个路头，且又是个多情的，若果聚合了倒是件美事，偏又生出这段事来。这薛家纵比冯家富贵，想其为人，自然姬妾众多，淫佚无度，未必及冯渊定情于一人。这正是梦幻情缘，恰遇见一对薄命儿女。且不要议论他人，只目今这官司如何剖断才好？”门子笑道：“老爷当年何其明决，今日何反成个没主意的人了？小的听见老爷补升此任，系贾府、王府之力。此薛蟠即贾府之亲，老爷何不顺水行舟做个人情，将此案了结，日后也好去见贾、王二公？”雨村道：“你说的何尝不是。但事关人命，蒙皇上隆恩起复委用，正竭力图报之时，岂可因私枉法，是实不忍为的。”门子听了冷笑道：“老爷说的自是正理，但如今世上是行不去的。岂不闻古人说的‘大丈夫相时而动。’又说：‘趋吉避凶者为君子。’依老爷这话，不但不能报效朝廷，亦且自身不保。还要三思为妥。”\n　　雨村低了头，半日说道：“依你怎么着？”门子道：“小人已想了个很好的主意在此：老爷明日坐堂，只管虚张声势，动文书发签拿人。凶犯自然是拿不来的，原告固是不依，只用将薛家族人及奴仆人等拿几个来拷问。小的在暗中调停，令他们报个‘暴病身亡’，合族中及地上共递一张保呈。老爷只说善能扶鸾请仙，堂上设了乩坛，令军民人等只管来看。老爷便说：‘乩仙批了，死者冯渊与薛蟠原系夙孽，今狭路相遇，原因了结，今薛蟠已得了无名之病，被冯渊的魂魄追索而死。其祸皆由拐子而起，除将拐子按法处治外，徐不累及’等语。小人暗中嘱咐拐子，令其实招，众人见乩仙批语与拐子相符，自然不疑了。薛家有的是钱，老爷断一千也可，五百也可，与冯家作烧埋之费。那冯家也无甚要紧的人，不过为的是钱，有了银子也就无话了。老爷细想此计如何？”雨村笑道：“不妥，不妥。等我再斟酌斟酌，压服得口声才好。”二人计议已定。至次日坐堂，勾取一干有名人犯。雨村详加审问，果见冯家人口稀少，不过赖此欲得些烧埋之银。薛家仗势倚情，偏不相让，故致颠倒未决。雨村便徇情枉法，胡乱判断了此案，冯家得了许多烧埋银子，也就无甚话说了。雨村便疾忙修书二封与贾政并京营节度使王子腾，不过说“令甥之事已完，不必过虑”之言寄去。此事皆由葫芦庙内沙弥新门子所为，雨村又恐他对人说出当日贫贱时事来，因此心中大不乐意。后来到底寻了他一个不是，远远的充发了才罢。\n　　当下言不着雨村。且说那买了英莲、打死冯渊的那薛公子，亦系金陵人氏，本是书香继世之家。只是如今这薛公子幼年丧父，寡母又怜他是个独根孤种，未溺爱纵容些，遂致老大无成，且家中有百万之富，现领着内帑钱粮，采办杂料。这薛公子学名薛蟠，表字文起，性情奢侈，言语傲慢，虽也上过学，不过略识几个字，终日惟有斗鸡走马、游山玩景而已。虽是皇商，一应经纪世事全然不知，不过赖祖父旧日的情分，户部挂个虚名支领钱粮，其馀事体，自有伙计老家人等措办。寡母王氏乃现任京营节度使王子腾之妹，与荣国府贾政的夫人王氏是一母所生的妹妹，今年方五十上下，只有薛蟠一子。还有一女，比薛蟠小两岁，乳名宝钗，生得肌骨莹润、举止娴雅。当时他父亲在日极爱此女，令其读书识字，较之乃兄竟高十倍。自父亲死后，见哥哥不能安慰母心，他便不以书字为念，只留心针黹家计等事，好为母亲分忧代劳。\n　　近因今上崇尚诗礼，征采才能，降不世之隆恩，除聘选姑娘外，在世宦名家之女，皆得亲名达部，以备选择，为宫主郡主入学陪侍，充为才人赞善之职。自薛蟠父亲死后，各省中所有的卖买承局、总管、伙计人等，见薛蟠年轻不诸世事，便趁时拐骗起来，京都几处生意渐亦销耗。薛蟠素闻得都中乃第一繁华之地，正思一游，便趁此机会，一来送妹待选，二来望亲，三来亲自入部销算旧账，再计新支。其实只为游览上国风光之意。因此早已检点下行装细软以及馈送亲友各色土物人情等类。正择日起身，不想偏遇着那拐子，买了英莲。薛蟠见英莲生的不俗，立意买了作妾，又遇冯家来夺，因恃强喝令豪奴将冯渊打死，便将家中事务，一一嘱托了族中人并几个老家人，自己同着母亲妹子竟自起身长行去了。人命官司他却视为儿戏，自谓花上几个钱没有不了的。\n　　在路不记其日。那日已将入都，又听见母舅王子腾升了九省统制，奉旨出都查边。薛蟠心中暗喜道：“我正愁进京去有舅舅管辖，不能任意挥霍，如今升出去，可知天从人愿。”亲商议道：“咱们京中虽有几处房舍，只是这十来年没人居住，那看守的人未免偷着租凭给人住，须得先着人去打扫收拾才好。”他母亲道：“何必如此招摇！咱们这次进京去，原是先拜望亲友，或是在你舅舅处，或是你姨父家，他两家的房舍极是宽敞的。咱们且住下，再慢慢儿的着人去收拾，岂不消停些？”薛蟠道：“如今舅舅正升了外省去，家里自然忙乱起身，咱们这会子反一窝一拖的奔了去，岂不没眼色呢。”他母亲道：“你舅舅虽升了去，还有你姨父家。况这几年来你舅舅姨娘两处，每每带信捎书接咱们来。如今既来了，你舅舅虽忙着起身，你贾家的姨娘未必不苦留我们，咱们且忙忙的收拾房子，岂不使人见怪？你的意思我早知道了，守着舅舅姨母住着，未免拘紧了，不如各自住着，好任意施为。你既如此，你自去挑所宅子去住，我和你姨娘妹妹们别了这几年，却要住几日。我带了你妹子去投你姨娘家去，你道好不好？”薛蟠见母亲如此说，情知扭不过，只得吩咐人夫，一路奔荣国府而来。\n　　那时王夫人巳知薛蟠官司一事亏贾雨村就中维持了，才放了心。又见哥哥升了边缺，正愁少了娘家的亲戚来往，略加寂寞。过了几日，忽家人报：“姨太太带了哥儿姐儿合家进京在门外下车了。”喜的王夫人忙带了人接到大厅上，将薛姨妈等接进去了。妹妹们一朝相见，悲喜交集，自不必说。叙了一番契阔，又引着拜见贾母，将人情土物各种酬献了。合家俱厮见过，又治席接风。薛蟠拜见过贾政贾琏，又引着见了贾赦贾珍等。贾政便使人进来对王夫人说：“姨太太已有了年纪，外甥年轻，不知庶务，在外住着恐又要生事。咱们东南角上梨香院那一所房十来间白空闲着，叫人请了姨太太和姐儿哥儿住了甚好。”王夫人原要留住，贾母也就遣人来说：“请姨太太就在这里住下，大家亲密些。”薛姨妈正欲同居一处，方可拘紧些儿，若另在外边，又恐纵性惹祸，遂忙应允。又私与王夫人说明：“一应日费供给，一概都免，方是处常之法。”王夫人知他家不难于此，遂亦从其自便。从此后，薛家母女就在梨香院住了。\n    原来这梨香院乃当日荣公暮年养静之所，小小巧巧，约有十馀间房舍，前厅后舍俱全。另有一门通街，薛蟠的家人就走此门出入：西南上又有一个角门，通着夹道子，出了夹道便是王夫人正房的东院了。每日或饭后或晚间，薛姨妈便过来，或与贾母闲谈，或与王夫人相叙。宝钗与黛玉、迎春妹妹等一处，或看书下棋，或做针黹，倒也十分相安。只是薛蟠起初原不欲在贾府中居住，生恐姨父管束，不得自在；无奈母亲执意在此，且贾宅中又十分殷勤苦留，只得暂且住下，一面使人打扫出自家的房屋再移居过去。谁知自此间住了不上一月，贾宅族中凡有的子侄俱已认熟了一半，都是那些纨裤气习，莫不喜与他来往。今日会酒，明日观花，甚至聚赌膘娟，无所不至，引诱的薛蟠比当日更坏了十倍。虽说贾政训子有方，治家有法，一则族大人多，照管不到；二则现在房长乃是贾珍，彼乃宁府长孙，又现袭职，凡族中事都是他掌管；三则公私冗杂，且素性潇洒，不以俗事为要，每公暇之时，不过看书着棋而已。况这梨香院相隔两层房舍，又有街门别开，任意可以出入，这些子弟们所以只管放意畅怀的。因此薛蟠遂将移居之念浙浙打灭了。\n    日后如何，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Let us return to Daiyu, who accompanied the girls to Lady Wang’s apartments. Her Ladyship was discussing family affairs with a messenger from her elder brother’s wife and mentioned a charge of manslaughter brought against her sister’s family. As Lady Wang seemed to have too much to attend to, the girls went to the rooms of Li Wan, widow of her son Jia Zhu.\n\nAlthough he died young, Jia Zhu had left a son called Jia Lan, now just five and already at school. Li Wan’s father, Li Shouzhong, a noted official of Jinling, had been a director of education. In his family, all the men and women alike had been devoted to study. But after he inherited the post, Li Shouzhong declared that “an unaccomplished woman is a virtuous woman.”1  He did not insist on a thorough education for his daughter, merely having her taught enough to read a few books such as The Four Books for Girls and Biographies of Martyred Women, with the result that she knew only a little of literature and could recollect the stories of some worthy women of earlier dynasties. Her main interests were weaving and sewing. That is why he gave her the name Li Wan (Li of the Loom) and the courtesy name Gongcai (Palace Seamstress).\n\nSo this young widow living in the lap of luxury was no better off than withered wood or cold ashes, taking no interest in the outside world. Apart from waiting on her elders and looking after her son, all she did was to accompany the girls at their embroidery or reading.\n\nAlthough Daiyu was only a guest here, with these cousins and sister-in-law for company, she had nothing to worry about apart from her father.\n\nBut now let us turn to Jia Yucun, who had been appointed prefect of Yingtian. No sooner had he arrived than a case of manslaughter was brought to his court. It concerned the rival claims of two families to a slave-girl who had been bought, and neither party would give way. This had resulted in an affray in which a man was killed. Yucun summoned the plaintiff for questioning.\n\n“The man killed was my master,” the plaintiff testified. “He bought a slave-girl, not knowing that she had been kidnapped. The kidnapper had already got our silver, then he sold the girl on the sly to the Xue family. When we found this out we went to demand her back. But, believe it or not, the Xue family are a powerful clan. They called out their arrogant slaves, who beat my master to death. Then the murderers, master and men, all made off, leaving no trace. I’ve been appealing for a whole year, but nothing has been done. I beg Your Honour to arrest the criminals, punish the evil-doers and help the widow and orphan. Then both the living and the dead will be everlastingly grateful!”\n\n“How outrageous!” exclaimed Yucun. “How can men kill and get away with it?” He was about to order his runners to arrest the criminals’ relatives and bring them to court for interrogation, when an attendant standing by his table shot him a warning glance. Then Yucun refrained and withdrew to his private office, from which he dismissed everyone except the attendant, who went down on one knee in salute.\n\n“Why wouldn’t you let me issue that order just now?” asked Yucun.\n\n“Your Honour has newly come to this post. Surely you have a copy of the ‘Local Gazetteer’2  for this province?”\n\n“What do you mean by a ‘Local Gazetteer’?”\n\n“Nowadays if you want to get on as an official you need a list of the most powerful, rich and high-ranking families in your district. In this province it runs:\n\nThe Zhu family in Jinling\nLacked nothing but jade,\nWhich the gods in their bounty\nGave to the Almanacs.\n\n“Sir, the Jia family in this rhyme stands for the two Dukes of Ningguo and Rongguo. The Xue family is that of the Imperial Commissioner. These three families are all closely connected by marriage. If you offend one, you offend them all. The people involved in this case are relatives of the Xue family. To act at random, as Your Honour proposed, would be as good as trying to scratch an itch through your boot.”\n\nYucun put on a shocked expression. “What an appalling state of affairs! But since that is how things are, how am I to settle this case?”\n\n“Your Honour is a man of wide learning and great wisdom,” replied the attendant with a cynical smile. “As the old saying goes, ‘A man of expediency will make the best of both worlds.’ I advise you to do that. For your own peace of mind too, it would be best to hush up this case.”\n\nYucun lowered his head in thought. “It would be unjust. I was given my post by the Emperor, and I am supposed to look after the people. How can I let such a crime go unpunished? I’d be failing in my duty. It’s out of the question.”\n\nThe attendant smiled sardonically. “If you do that, Your Honour, I’m afraid not only will you be unable to repay the Emperor’s kindness, but you may endanger your own into the bargain. You had better think it over.”\n\nYucun felt dismayed and ashamed. “What do you suggest, then?” he asked. “To be frank, I’m still so new here that I need your advice.”\n\n“I’ve thought of an excellent plan,” replied the attendant. “Tomorrow when you open court, you can simply issue a warrant for the arrest of the murderers. Of course the accused won’t be here, so the relatives will be seized instead. We can then hand the plaintiff a statement that the man killed died of a sudden illness, and that will settle the matter. As for the Xue family, being so powerful, they can easily get the kidnapper and the witnesses to say what they’re told. Then when the court investigates, we can fix it so that the kidnapper takes the blame for the murder. The kidnappers are a tough lot, you know. If we put one of them to the torture he’ll confess. We can say that the dead man was done in by the kidnapper, who then decamped. Then we can issue a warrant for his arrest, and when he’s caught and brought in the case can be closed. That way the plaintiff will have nothing to say. If Your Honour thinks this a good plan, I’ve a draft here all ready for you.”\n\nYucun promptly agreed. After a little more discussion he asked, “What about the slave-girl?”\n\n“There’s no problem about her,” said the attendant. “After this case is settled, the Xue family will naturally pay the kidnapper a sum of money. You needn’t worry about that.”\n\nYucun smiled. “Yes, that’s true.”\n\nThat night he turned the matter over and over in his mind, but could think of no better plan. So the next day in court he acted accordingly. As soon as the plaintiff saw that the new prefect was determined to hush up the case, he naturally protested. But Yucun, deaf to his pleas, upheld the verdict.\n\nYucun then wrote two letters to Jia Zheng and Wang Ziteng, the commander-in-chief of the Capital Garrison, to inform them that the case had been settled and they need have no further anxiety.\n\nBut the kidnapper, though he had made a false confession, was severely punished and not released. All the witnesses were told to hold their tongues.\n\nNow that Xue Pan had this charge of manslaughter against him settled, he thought no more of it. So with his mother and younger sister he proceeded, in high spirits, to the capital.\n\nEvery provincial official keeps a blacklist of the most powerful, rich and high-ranking local families. Such lists are common in all provinces. For if any official inadvertently offends one of these families, he may not only lose his post but his very life as well. That is why they are called “protective talismans.”\n\nThe Hsueh family just mentioned is one you cannot afford to offend, sir. This court case won’t be hard to settle, but previous prefects have only dragged it out because they were afraid to offend anyone.” With that he took a copy of the “protective talisman” from his pouch and handed it to Yutsun, who read the following doggerel:\n\nThe Chinling Chias, if truth be told,\nHave halls of jade, stables of gold.\nVast as the ocean the Shihs’ palatial dwellings,\nThe Nanking Wangs’ coffers are silver-lined.\nThe Hsuehs in wealth are all peers excelling.\n\nBefore Yutsun could finish reading, a gateman announced, “His Excellency Wang is here.” Yutsun hastily put on his official robes and cap and went out to welcome the visitor. He was detained for some time and on his return the gateman took up where he had left off.\n\n“These four families are all closely connected by marriage,” he said. “If one loses, all lose; if one gains, all gain. And the murderer Hsueh Pan who is charged with assault and battery belongs to that Hsueh family whose ‘snow’ is ‘silver.’ Not only has he the support of the three other families, he has plenty of influential friends and relatives at court and in the provinces as well. Now which of them are you going to arrest, sir?”\n\n“Then what do you suggest?” asked Yutsun with a smile. “I suppose you know this criminal’s hiding-place?”\n\n“To tell you the truth, sir, not only do I know where he’s hiding, I know the kidnapper too, and I know the servant who was bought and the man who was killed. Let me give you all the facts.\n\n“The man killed was the son of a minor local official named Feng Yuan. His parents are dead and he has no brothers. He lived on a small inheritance. He was eighteen or nineteen and was a confirmed homosexual, not interested in women. But for him it was love at first sight when he chanced to see this kidnapped girl. He made up his mind to marry her, swearing not to touch another man or take a second wife. So he was in no hurry, having fixed the third day after for the wedding. Then the kidnapper sold the girl to the Hsueh family, meaning to abscond with money from both parties. But before he could get away they both grabbed him and beat him half to death. Neither family would take back its money, each insisting on having the girl.\n\n“Young Hsueh, who is a headstrong, violent brute, would brook no argument. He ordered his servants to set on young Feng and they beat him to a pulp. He was carried home and died three days later. Young Hsueh had already chosen a day to set off for the capital. After beating his man and carrying off the girl, he went off unconcernedly with his family as if nothing had happened. Isn’t he answerable for a life? But he leaves his clansmen and servants to clear up the mess.\n\n“This, however, is by the way. Do you know, sir, who the girl is that was sold?”\n\n“How should I know?”\n\nThe gateman gave a cynical laugh. “She’s the daughter of your great benefactor! She’s Yinglien, the daughter of Mr. Chen who lived next to Gourd Temple.”\n\n“Good heavens!” exclaimed Yutsun in astonishment. “So that’s who it is! I heard she was kidnapped when she was five. But why wasn’t she sold before now?”\n\n“This type of kidnapper specializes in stealing small girls whom he brings up till they are twelve or thirteen and then sells in some other district. When we were neighbours, Yinglien used to play every day with us. Although she’s changed a lot in seven or eight years and grown very pretty, I recognized her because she still has a faint red mark between her eyebrows. The kidnapper had rented my house, and one day when he was out I got her to talk. She said the kidnapper beat her so often she dared not speak, simply passing him off as her own father who was selling her to pay his debts. She insisted on this so tearfully that I didn’t like to press her.\n\nHe started crying again and said, ‘I can’t remember anything about my childhood.’ That confirmed my suspicion. The day Mr Feng saw her and paid over the silver, the kidnapper was drunk and Caltrop said with a sigh, ‘At last my troubles are over!’ But when she heard she wouldn’t be fetched till three days later, she was rather upset. I felt so sorry for her that after the kidnapper had gone I sent my wife over to comfort her.\n\n‘Mr Feng insists on choosing an auspicious day to fetch you,’ my wife told her. ‘That shows he doesn’t look on you as a servant. He’s a real gentleman with a fine character and plenty of money. And he’s such a woman-hater, this is the first time he’s ever wanted to take a concubine. He’s paid a good price for you, so you can guess what nice times you’ll have together. Just be patient for a couple of days. What are you worrying about?’\n\nThat reassured her a little and she began to look forward to her new life. Who could have foreseen the disaster the very next day? She was sold to the Xues. It might not have been so bad if she’d gone to anyone else; but this young Xue is known as the Oafish King and he’s the most brutal, headstrong bully imaginable, who throws money about like dirt. After raising a rumpus and beating everybody in sight, he dragged her off by force, and we don’t know whether she’s alive or dead. As for Mr Feng, his hopes were dashed. Not only did he lose the girl, he paid for it with his life. Wasn’t that tragic?”\n\nYucun sighed. “Yes, indeed. But such karmic troubles are not accidental. Otherwise, why should Feng Yuan have lost his heart to Caltrop? After years of cruel treatment at the hands of a kidnapper, she had found a way out and he was a devoted young man. It would have been an excellent match. Then this had to happen! The Xues may be richer than the Fengs, but judging by young Xue’s behaviour he must have any number of concubines and be a loose-living profligate, quite unlike Feng Yuan who wanted to marry her. This is indeed ‘a romantic dream and a fateful meeting’ for two ill-fated young people. But we needn’t discuss them now. How is this lawsuit to be settled?”\n\nThe gateman smiled. “In the past, Your Honour was never at a loss. Why are you so undecided today? I’ve heard that your promotion was due to the good offices of the Jia and Wang families. And this Xue Pan is related to the Jias by marriage. Why not do them a good turn by settling this case in such a way that you’ll be able to face them in future?”\n\n“Impossible!” retorted Yucun. “This is a case of homicide. After His Majesty has pardoned me and restored me to this post I must do my best to show my gratitude. How can I flout the law for private considerations? I really cannot do that.”\n\nThe gateman smiled sarcastically. “What you say is right and proper, sir, but it won’t work. In times like these a man who does his duty regardless of circumstances won’t get far. Haven’t you heard the ancient sayings: ‘The superior man bends with the wind’ and ‘A true man knows how to swim with the tide’? If you stick to your high principles, not only will you be unable to repay the Emperor’s goodness and help your patrons, but you may find your own life in danger. You’d better think it over.”\n\nYucun lowered his head. After a long silence he asked, “What do you suggest?”\n\n“I’ve thought of a very good plan. When you open the court tomorrow, issue warrants and order the arrest of the culprits, of course. Naturally you won’t be able to lay hands on the murderer. The plaintiff won’t be satisfied, so you can arrest some of Xue’s clansmen and servants for questioning. I shall pull strings in the background to get them to report that Xue Pan died suddenly of a sudden illness, and have the heads of the clans and the local authorities jointly submit a petition to this effect.\n\n“You can say that you are good at divination. Set up a divination stand in your court and call in the local gentry and people to watch. Then announce that the immortal has revealed that the deceased Feng Yuan and Xue Pan were enemies in a former existence who have met now to settle old scores. That Xue Pan has now succumbed to some mysterious disease as a result of being pursued by Feng Yuan’s ghost. And that since all this trouble was caused by the kidnapper, in accordance with the law he should be punished but no one else is to be implicated.\n\n“I shall secretly advise the kidnapper to make a full confession; and when everyone sees that the immortal’s writing corresponds to his evidence, they’re bound to believe it.\n\nAs for money, that’s no problem. Your Honour can award them five hundred or a thousand taels for funeral expenses. The Fengs aren’t an important family and are only out for money. If they’re paid they’ll have nothing more to say. What do you think of this plan, sir?”\n\n“Not good, not good. Let me think it over again,” said Yucun with a smile. “I must see that no one talks.”\n\nHaving reached this decision, the next day he opened court and summoned all the witnesses. He cross-examined them carefully and found that the Feng family had indeed few dependants and were only using this case to extort money. But the Xues, counting on their powerful connections, had refused to compromise; hence the deadlock.\n\nYucun misapplied the law and passed arbitrary judgment. He awarded the Feng family compensation for funeral expenses and, as he had expected, they raised no further objections.\n\nHe then lost no time in writing two letters to Jia Zheng and to Wang Ziteng, the Prince of Jing’s brother-in-law who was a garrison commander, to announce, “Your nephew’s case is now settled. Please do not worry.”\n\nThis business had been settled by that minor pawn in Yucun’s office who had been a novice in Gourd Temple. But Yucun, afraid he might disclose the story of his poverty in earlier days, felt far from happy. Eventually he found some fault with him and had him drafted and sent to serve in a distant part of the country.\n\nBut no more of this.\n\nLet us turn instead to young Xue, the one who had bought Yinglian and killed Feng Yuan. His family was also from Jinling. He came from a line of scholars and his father, now dead, had held a post in the Imperial Treasury. Left an orphan in youth, the only son of a doting widow, he had been so thoroughly spoilt that he had grown up good for nothing. Although his family with a million in property was on the Bureau of Revenue’s books as a provisioner of the court and purveyor of miscellaneous goods, he was extravagant, arrogant and useless. He had studied for a while in his childhood but all he had learned to read were a few characters. Spending his time cockfighting, horse-racing or sight-seeing, though a merchant by appointment he knew nothing of business or worldly affairs. Thanks to his grandfather’s old connections he had his name on the books of the Board of Revenue and drew his pay as a purser, while all other business was handled for him by his clerks and stewards.\n\nHis widowed mother née Wang was a younger sister of Wang Ziteng, now garrison commander of the capital, and of Lady Wang, the wife of Jia Zheng in the Rong Mansion. She was about fifty and had only this one son. Besides him she had a daughter two years younger called Bao-chai, an attractive, intelligent girl with graceful manners. Since her father had been fond of her and made her study, she was far better educated than her brother. He had given up learning after his father’s death, and seeing that her brother could not console their mother for her loss, the girl gave up her studies too and devoted herself to needlework and household matters to help her mother.\n\nRecently, because the Emperor valued virtue and talent, the selection of talented women was extended from the palace itself to all distinguished families, to serve as companions to princesses and the daughters of nobles as honorary secretaries or instructresses. Since the death of her father, however, Xue Pan had heard that the capital was a paradise for pleasure and had long been wanting to go there to enjoy himself. The approach of the selection of palace ladies was the first reason he gave for their trip. His second was to visit his relatives, his third to clear his accounts with the Board of Revenue and plan further outlays; but his chief object was to see the sights of the capital.\n\nHe had long since started preparations for the journey, having his wardrobe made ready and all the gifts they would need for relatives and friends.\n\nThe day for their departure was fixed when he chanced to meet the kidnapper and bought Yinglian. Beating Feng Yuan to death was nothing to him. He simply ordered his servants to see to it and, taking his mother and sister, he started on his journey as if nothing had happened. He had entrusted some clansmen and old family servants with the task of settling his affairs and following later.\n\n人命官司一事，他竟视为儿戏，自为花上几个臭钱，没有不了的。\n\nA few taels of silver settled the matter.\n\nWe need not dwell on the number of days they spent on the journey. As they were approaching the capital Xue Pan heard that his uncle Wang Ziteng had been promoted to commander-in-chief of nine provinces and had been ordered to leave the capital to inspect the frontiers. This secretly delighted him.\n\n“I was just worrying that with my uncle in the capital I shouldn’t be able to enjoy myself as much as I wanted,” he thought. “Now that he’s been promoted and is going away, Heaven is on my side.”\n\nHe said to his mother, “We have several houses in the capital, but it’s ten years and more since anyone stayed in them and the watchmen have probably been renting them out on the sly. We’ll have to send men on ahead to get one cleaned up for us.”\n\n“Why all this fuss?” objected his mother. “Our main object in coming to the capital is to call on our relatives and friends. Either your uncle’s or your aunt’s place is big enough to put us up. Let’s stay with one of them for the time being while we send servants to get one of our own houses ready. That will save a lot of trouble.”\n\n“But uncle has just been promoted and given a new post; his household must be in a great bustle. If the whole lot of us descend on them now, won’t it look rather awkward?”\n\n“Even if your uncle has gone away, there’s your aunt’s place. Besides, these last few years your uncle and aunt have kept writing to ask us to visit them. Now that we’re here, even if your uncle’s busy your aunt may insist on our staying. If we start cleaning one of our houses in such a rush, people are bound to think us eccentric. I know what’s in your mind. You’re afraid of being kept under your uncle and aunt’s eye and want to be on your own to do as you like. Well, since that’s the case, go and choose a house for yourself. It’s some years since I’ve seen your aunt and cousins and I’d like to spend a few days with them. I’ll take your sister and stay with your aunt. What do you say to that?”\n\nXue Pan, who could never gainsay his mother, had to order the servants to proceed to the Rong Mansion.\n\nLady Wang had been worried by the news of Xue Pan’s manslaughter case, but learning that Jia Yucun had settled it she stopped worrying. Then her brother’s promotion and transfer to the frontier distressed her as it meant one relative the less in the capital. Some days later, however, she was told that her sister had arrived with her son and daughter and their baggage. Overjoyed, she hurried out with some of her servants to welcome them into the main hall.\n\nThe meeting of the two sisters was a happy and moving one, which need not be described in detail. After they had exchanged news they lost no time in paying their respects to the Lady Dowager, presenting her with gifts from their native place as well as with other gifts. All the inmates of the Rong Mansion were introduced, and a feast of welcome was prepared.\n\nXue Pan paid his respects to Jia Zheng and Jia Lian, who then introduced him to Jia She and Jia Zhen. Jia Zheng sent a message to his wife to say:\n\n“Our sister-in-law is getting on in years and our nephew is young and inexperienced. If they stay outside we are afraid he may get into fresh trouble. We have a dozen or so rooms empty in the Pear Fragrance Court in the southeast corner. Why not ask them to move in there?”\n\nLady Wang had in fact wanted to keep her sister, and the Lady Dowager also sent to urge them to stay, saying, “Do make your home here with us, dear sister, so that we can be close to each other.”\n\nAunt Xue had been hoping they could live together for the sake of her son, who needed keeping in check. If they stayed on their own outside, she was afraid he might run wild again. She promptly agreed, and confided to her sister in private, “For daily expenses we must pay our own way. That is the only way we can stay here permanently.”\n\nKnowing that they could well afford this, Lady Wang agreed. And so the Xues came to live in the Pear Fragrance Court.\n\nThis court, which the Duke of Rongguo had built for his retirement, was small and tasteful. It had more than ten rooms, including a reception hall and living quarters. There was a separate gate giving on to the street, through which Xue Pan and his men could come and go. Another side gate in the southwest corner opened on to a passage leading to the eastern courtyard of Lady Wang’s main apartment. Every day, either after her meal or in the evening, Aunt Xue would come over to chat with the Lady Dowager or to talk with her sister.\n\nAfter lunch or in the evening Aunt Xue would come over to chat with the Lady Dowager or with Lady Wang. And Baochai spent all her time with Daiyu and Yingchun, reading, playing chess or doing embroidery, so that they got on very well together.\n\nXue Pan at first had not wanted to stay in the Rong Mansion for fear that his uncle would restrict him; but his mother insisted and the Jia family pressed them so earnestly to remain that he had to agree to stay for the time being, while sending servants to clean their own house ready for a move. However, less than a month in the Jia household had acquainted him with half the young men of the clan, all of them fops and rowdies who soon drew him into every kind of dissipation: today a drinking party, tomorrow an excursion to enjoy the flowers, gambling and visits to prostitutes, until he became ten times worse than before.\n\nAlthough Jia Zheng was known for his good method of training sons and managing his household, first, the clan was too large for him to keep an eye on everyone; second, being head of the clan he was in charge of all public affairs; and third, being advanced in years and fond of leisure, he left the management of most family affairs to his wife and the young people. Thus, in spite of his own strict principles, how could he attend to everything?\n\nBesides, the clan chief at this time was Jia Zhen, who as the eldest grandson of the Ning Mansion had inherited the title and was responsible for all clan affairs. Moreover, he had so many public and private business to attend to and was by nature so unconventional that he did not take vulgar matters seriously, but spent his leisure reading or playing chess. And since Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two other courtyards from the street and had a separate gate, the young men could come and go as they pleased. So Xue Pan gradually gave up the idea of moving.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
