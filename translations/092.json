  "original": "话说宝玉从潇湘馆出来，连忙问秋纹道：“老爷叫我作什么？”秋纹笑道：“没有叫。袭人姐姐叫我请二爷，我怕你不来，才哄你的。”宝玉听了，才把心放下，因说：“你们请我也罢了，何苦来唬我？”说着，回到怡红院内。袭人便问道：“你这好半天到那里去了？”宝玉道：“在林姑娘那边，说起姨妈家宝姐姐的事来，就坐住了。”袭人又问道：“说些什么？”宝玉将打禅语的话述了一遍。袭人道：“你们再没个计较。正经说些家常闲话儿，或讲究些诗句，也是好的，怎么又说到禅语上了？又不是和尚。”宝玉道：“你不知道，我们有我们的禅机，别人是插不下嘴去的。”袭人笑道：“你们参禅参翻了，又叫我们跟着打闷葫芦了。”宝玉道：“头里我也年纪小，他也孩子气，所以我说了不留神的话，他就恼了。如今我也留神，他也没有恼的了。只是他近来不常过来，我又念书，偶然到一处，好象生疏了似的。”袭人道：“原该这么着才是。都长了几岁年纪了，怎么好意思还象小孩子时候的样子？”\n　　宝玉点头道：“我也知道。如今且不用说那个。我问你：老太太那里打发人来说什么来着没有？”袭人道：“没有说什么。”宝玉道：“必是老太太忘了。明儿不是十一月初一日么？年年老太太那里必是个老规矩，要办消寒会，齐打伙儿坐下喝酒说笑。我今日已经在学房里告了假了。这会子没有信儿，明儿可是去不去呢？若去了呢，白白的告了假；若不去，老爷知道了，又说我偷懒。”袭人道：“据我说，你竟是去的是。才念的好些儿了，又想歇着。我劝你也该上点紧儿了。昨儿听见太太说，兰哥儿念书真好，他打学房里回来，还各自念书作文章，天天晚上弄到四更多天才睡。你比他大多了，又是叔叔，倘或赶不上他，又叫老太太生气。倒不如明儿早起去罢。”麝月道：“这么冷天，已经告了假，又去，叫学房里说既这么着就不该告假呀，显见的是告谎假脱滑儿。依我说，乐得歇一天。就是老太太忘记了，咱们这里就不消寒了么？咱们也闹个会儿，不好么？”袭人道：“都是你起头儿，二爷更不肯去了。”麝月道：“我也是乐一天是一天，比不得你要好名儿，使唤一个月，再多得二两银子。”袭人啐道：“小蹄子儿，人家说正经话，你又来胡拉混扯的了。”麝月道：“我倒不是混拉扯，我是为你。”袭人道：“为我什么？”麝月道：“二爷上学去了，你又该咕嘟着嘴想着，巴不得二爷早些儿回来，就有说有笑的了。这会子又假撇清，何苦呢！我都看见了。”\n　　袭人正要骂他，只见老太太那里打发人来，说道：”老太太说了，叫二爷明儿不用上学呢。明儿请了姨太太来给他解闷，只怕姑娘们都来家里的。史姑娘、邢姑娘、李姑娘们都请了，明儿来赴什么消寒会呢。”宝玉没有听完，便喜欢道：“可不是？老太太最高兴的。明目不上学，是过了明路的了。”袭人也不便言语了。那丫头回去。宝玉认真念了几天书，巴不得玩这一天，又听见薛姨妈过来，想着宝姐姐自然也来，心里喜欢。便说：“快睡罢，明日早些起来。”于是一夜无话。\n　　到了次日，果然一早到老太太那里请了安。又到贾政、王大人那里请了安，回明了老太太今儿不叫上学，贾政也没言语，便慢慢退出来。走了几步，便一溜烟跑到贾母房中。见众人都没来，只有凤姐那边的奶妈子，带了巧姐儿，跟着几个小丫头过来，给老太太请了安，说：“我妈妈先叫我来请安，陪着老太太说说话儿。妈妈回来就来。”贾母笑着道：“好孩子，我一早就起来了，等他们总不来。只有你二叔叔来了。”那奶妈子便说：“姑娘，给叔叔请安。”巧姐便请了安。宝玉也问了一声“妞妞好？”巧姐道：“昨夜听见我妈妈说，要请二叔叔去说话。”宝玉道：“说什么？”巧姐道：“我妈妈说，跟着李妈认了几年字，不知道我认得不认得。我说都认得。我认给妈妈瞧，妈妈说我瞎认，不信，说我一天尽子玩，那里认得。我瞧着那些字也不要紧，就是那《女孝经》也是容易念的。妈妈说我哄他，要请二叔叔得空儿的时候给我理理。”贾母听了，笑道：“好孩子，你妈妈是不认得字的，所以说你哄他。明儿叫你二叔叔理给他瞧瞧他就信了。”宝玉道：“你认了多少字了？巧姐儿道：“认了三千多字，念了一本《女孝经》，半个月头里又上了《列女传》。”宝玉道：“你念了懂的吗？你要不懂，我倒是讲讲这个你听罢。”贾母道：“做叔叔的也该讲给侄女儿听听。”\n　　宝玉便道：“那文王后妃不必说了。那姜后脱簪待罪和齐国的无盐安邦定国，是后妃里头的贤能的。”巧姐听了，答应个“是”。宝玉又道：“若说有才的，是曹大姑、班婕妤、蔡文姬、谢道韫诸人。”巧姐问道：“那贤德的呢？”宝玉道：“孟光的荆钗布裙，鲍宣妻的提瓮出汲，陶侃母的截发留宾，这些不厌贫的，就是贤德了。”巧姐欣然点头。宝玉道：“还有苦的，象那乐昌破镜，苏蕙回文；那孝的，木兰代父从军，曹娥投水寻尸等类，也难尽说。”巧姐听到这些，却默默如有所思。宝玉又讲那曹氏的引刀割鼻及那些守节的，巧姐听着更觉肃敬起来。宝玉恐他不自在，又说：“那些艳的，如王嫱、西子、樊素、小蛮、绛仙、文君、红拂，都是女中的……”尚未说出，贾母见巧姐默然，便说：“够了，不用说了。讲的太多，他那里记得。”巧姐道：“二叔叔才说的，也有念过的，也有没念过的。念过的一讲我更知道好处了。”宝玉道：“那字是自然认得的，不用再理了。”\n　　巧姐道：“我还听见我妈妈说：我们家的小红，头里是二叔叔那里的，我妈妈要了来，还没有补上人呢。我妈妈想着要把什么柳家的五儿补上，不知二叔叔要不要。”宝玉听了更喜欢，笑着道：“你听你妈妈的话！要补谁就补谁罢咧，又问什么要不要呢。”因又向贾母笑道：“我瞧大妞妞这个小模样儿，又有这个聪明儿，只怕将来比凤姐姐还强呢，又比他认的字。”贾母道：“女孩儿家认得字也好，只是女工针黹倒是要紧的。”巧姐儿道：“我也跟着刘妈妈学着做呢。什么扎花吻，拉锁子例，我虽弄不好，却也学着会做几针儿。”贾母迢：“咱们这样人家，固然不仗着自己做，但只到底知道些，日后才不受人家的拿捏。”巧姐答应看“是”，还要宝玉解说《列女传》，见宝玉呆呆的，也不好再问。你道宝玉呆的是什么？只因柳五儿要进怡红院，头一次是他病了，不能进来，第二次王夫人撵了晴雯，大凡有些姿色的，都不敢挑。后来又在吴贵家看晴雯去，五儿跟着他妈给睛雯送东西去，见了一面，更觉娇娜妩媚。今日亏得凤姐想着，叫他补入小红的窝儿，竟是喜出望外了，所以呆呆的呆想。\n　　贾母等着那些人，见这时候还不来，又叫丫头去请。回来李纨同着他妹子、探春、惜春、史湘云、黛玉都来了。大家请了贾母的安，众人厮见。独有薛姨妈未到，贾母又叫请去。果然薛姨妈带着宝琴过来。宝玉请了安，问了好，只不见宝钗邢岫烟二人。黛玉便问起：“宝姐姐为何不来？”薛姨妈假说身上不好。邢岫烟知道薛姨妈在坐，所以不来。宝玉虽见宝钗不来，心中纳闷，因黛玉来了，便把想宝钗的心暂且搁开。不多时，邢、王二夫人也来了。凤姐听见婆婆们先到了，自己不好落后，只得打发平儿先来告假，说是：“正要过来，因身上发热，过一回儿就来。”贾母道：“既是身上不好，不来也罢。咱们这时候很该吃饭了。”丫头们把火盆往后挪了一挪，就在贾母榻前一溜摆下两桌，大家序次坐下。吃了饭，依旧围炉闲谈，不须多赘。\n　　且说凤姐因何不来？头里为着倒比邢、王二夫人迟了不好意思，后来旺儿家的来回说：“迎姑娘那里打发人来请奶奶安，还说并没有到上头，只到奶奶这里来。”凤姐听了纳闷，不知又是什么事，便叫那人进来，问：“姑娘在家好？”那人道：“有什么好的。奴才并不是姑娘打发来的，实在是司棋的母亲央我来求奶奶的。”凤姐道：“司棋已经出去了，为什么来求我？”那人道：“自从司棋出去，终日啼哭。忽然那一日，他表兄来了。他母亲见了，恨的什么儿似的，说他害了司棋，一把拉住要打。那小子不敢言语。谁知司棋听见了，急忙出来，老着脸，和他母亲说：‘我是为他出来的，我也恨他没良心。如今他来了，妈要打他，不如勒死了我罢。’他妈骂他：‘不害臊的东西，你心里要怎么样？’司棋说：‘一个女人嫁一个男人。我一时失脚，上了他的当，我就是他的人了，决不肯再跟着别人的。我只恨他为什么这么胆小，一身作事一身当，为什么逃了呢？就是他一辈子不来，我也一辈子不嫁人的。妈要给我配人，我原拼着一死。今儿他来了，妈问他怎么样。要是他不改心，我在妈跟前磕了头，只当是我死了，他到那里，我跟到那里，就是讨饭吃也是愿意的。’他妈气的了不得，便哭着骂着说：‘你是我的女儿，我偏不给他，你敢怎么着？’那知道司棋这东西糊涂，便一头撞在墙上，把脑袋撞破，鲜血流出，竟碰死了。他妈哭着，救不过来，便要叫那小子偿命。他表兄也奇，说道：‘你们不用着急。我在外头原发了财，因想着他才回来的，心也算是真了。你们要不信，只管瞧。’说着打怀里掏出一匣子金珠首饰来。他妈妈看见了，心软了，说：“你既有心，为什么总不言语？”他外甥道：‘大凡女人都是水性杨花，我要说有钱，他就是贪图银钱了。如今他这为人就是难得的。我把首饰给你们，我去买棺盛殓他。’那司棋的母亲接了东西，也不顾女孩儿了，由着外甥去。那里知道他外甥叫人抬了两口棺材来。司棋的母亲看见诧异，说怎么棺材要两口，他外甥笑道：‘一口装不下，得两口才好。’司棋的母亲见他外甥又不哭，只当是他心疼的傻了。岂知他忙着把司棋收拾了，也不啼哭，眼错不见，把带的小刀子往脖子里一抹，也就抹死了。司棋的母亲懊悔起来，倒哭的了不得。如今坊里知道了，要报官。他急了，央我来求奶奶说个人情，他再过来给奶奶磕头。”\n　　凤姐听了，诧异道：“那有这样傻丫头，偏偏的就碰见这个傻小子！怪不得那一天翻出那些东西来，他心里没事人似的，敢只是这么个烈性孩子。论起来我也没这么大工夫管他这些闲事，但只你才说的，叫人听着怪可怜见儿的。也罢了，你回去告诉他，我和你二爷说，打发旺儿给他撕掳就是了。”凤姐打发那人去了，才过贾母这边来，不提。\n　　且说贾政这日正与詹光下大棋，通局的输赢也差不多，单为着一只角儿死活未分，在那里打结。门上的小厮进来回道：“外面冯大爷要见老爷。”贾政说：“请进来。”小厮出去请了，冯紫英走进门来，贾政忙迎着。冯紫英进来，在书房中坐下，见是下棋，便道：“只管下棋，我来观局。”詹光笑道：“晚生的棋是不堪瞧的。”冯紫英道：“好说，请下罢。”贾政道：“有什么事么？”冯紫英道：“没有什么话。老伯只管下棋，我也学几着儿。”贾政向詹光道：“冯大爷是我们相好的，既没事，我们索性下完了这一局再说话儿。冯大爷在旁边瞧着。”冯紫英道：“下采不下采？”詹光道：“下采的。”冯紫英道：“下采的是不好多嘴的。”贾政道：“多嘴也不妨，横竖他输了十来两银子，终久是不拿出来的。往后只好罚他做东便了。”詹光笑道：“这倒使得。”冯紫英道：“老伯和詹公对下么？”贾政笑道：“从前对下，他输了，如今让他两个子儿，他又输了。时常还要悔几着，不叫他悔他就急了。”詹光也笑道：“没有的事。”贾政道：“你试试瞧。”大家一面说笑，一面下完了。做起棋来，詹光还了棋头，输了七个子儿。冯紫英道：“这盘总吃亏在打结里头。老伯结少，就便宜了。”\n　　贾政对冯紫英道：“有罪，有罪，咱们说话儿罢。”冯紫英道：“小侄与老伯久不见面。一来会会，二来因广西的同来进来引见，带了四种洋货，可以做得贡的。一件是围屏，有二十四扇子，都是紫檀雕刻的。中间虽说不是玉，却是绝好的硝子石，石上镂出山水、人物、楼台、花鸟儿来。一扇上有五六十个人，都是宫妆的女子，名为‘汉宫春晓’。人的眉、目、口、鼻以及出手、衣褶，刻得又清楚，又细腻。点缀布置，都是好的。我想尊府大观园中正厅上恰好用的着。还有一架钟表，有三尺多高，也是一个童儿拿着时辰牌，到什么时候儿就报什么时辰。里头还有消息人儿打十番儿。这是两件重笨的，却还没有拿来。现在我带在这里的两件，却倒有些意思儿。”就在身边拿出一个锦匣子来，用几重白绫裹着。揭开了绵子，第一层是一个玻璃盒子，里头金托子大红绉绸托底，上放着一颗桂圆大的珠子，光华耀目。冯紫英道：“据说这就叫做‘母珠’。”因叫：拿一个盘儿来。”詹光即忙端过一个黑漆茶盘，道：“使得么？”冯紫英道：“使得。”便又向怀里掏出一个白绢包儿，将包儿里的珠子都倒在盘里散着，把那颗母珠搁在中间，将盘放于桌上。看见那些小珠子儿滴溜滴溜的都滚到大珠子身边，回来把这颗大珠子抬高了，别处的小珠子一颗也不剩，都粘在大珠上。詹光道：“这也奇！”贾政道：“这是有的，所以叫做‘母珠’，原是珠之母。”\n　　那冯紫英又回头看着他跟来的小厮道：“那个匣子呢？”小厮赶忙捧过一个花梨木匣子来。大家打开看时，原来匣内衬着虎纹锦、锦上叠着一束蓝纱。詹光道：“这是什么东西！”冯紫英道：“这叫做‘鲛绡帐’。”在匣子里拿出来寸，叠得长不满五寸，厚不上半寸。冯紫英一层一层的打中，打到十来层，已经桌上铺不下了。冯紫英道：“你看，里头还有两褶、必得高屋里去才张得下。这就是鲛丝所织。暑热天气张在堂屋里头，苍蝇蚊子一个不能进来，又轻又亮。”贾政道：“不用全打开，怕叠起来倒费事。”詹光便与马紫英一层一层折好收拾了。\n　　冯紫英道：“这四件东西，价儿也不贵，两万银他就卖。母珠一万，鲛绡帐五千，‘汉宫春晓’与自鸣钟五千。”贾政道：“那里买的起！”冯紫英道：“你们是个国戚，难道里头用不着么？贾政道：“用得着的很多，只是那里有这些银子？等我叫人拿进去给老太太瞧瞧。”冯紫英道：“很是。”\n　　贾政便着人叫贾琏把这两件东西送到老太太那边去，并叫人请了邢、王二夫人、凤姐儿都来瞧着，又把两件东西一一试过。贾琏道：“他还有两件：一件是围屏，一件是乐钟。共总要卖二万银子呢。”凤姐儿接着道：“东西自然是好的，但是那里有这些闲钱？咱们又不比外任督抚要办贡。我已经想了好些年了，象咱们这种人家，必得置些不动摇的根基才好：或是祭地，或是义庄，再置些坟屋。往后子孙遇见不得意的事，还是点儿底子，不到一败涂地。我的意思是这样，不知老太太、老爷、太太们怎么样？若是外头老爷们要买只管买。”贾母与众人都说：“这话说的倒也是。”贾琏道：“还了他罢。原是老爷叫我送给老太太瞧，为的是宫里好进，谁说买来搁在家里？老太太还没开口，你便主了一大堆丧气话。”说着，便把两件东西拿出去了，告诉贾政，只说：“老太太不要。”便与冯紫英道：“这两件东西好可好，就只没银子。我替你留心，有要买的人我便送信给你去。”冯紫英只得收拾好了，坐下说些闲话，没有兴头，就要起身。贾政道：“你在这里吃了晚饭去罢。”冯紫英道：“罢了，来了就叨搅老伯吗？”贾政道：“说那里的话。”\n　　正说着，人回：“大老爷来了。”贾赦早已进来。彼此相见，叙些寒温。不一时摆上酒来，肴馔罗列，大家喝着酒。至四五巡后，说起洋货的话。冯紫英道：“这种货本是难消的。除非要象尊府这样人家还可消得，其馀就难了。”贾政道：“这也不见得。”贾赦道：“我们家里也比不得从前了，这回儿也不过是个空门面。”冯紫英又问：“东府珍大爷可好么？我前儿见他，说起家常话儿来，提到他令郎续娶的媳妇远不及头里那位秦氏奶奶了。如今后娶的到底是那一家的？我也没有问起。”贾政道：“我们这个侄孙媳妇儿也是这里大家，从前做过京畿道的胡老爷的女孩儿。”冯紫英道：“胡道长我是知道的。但是他家教上也不怎么样。也罢了，只要姑娘好就好。”\n贾琏道：“听得内阁里人说起，雨村又要升了。”贾政道：“这也好。不知准不准？”贾琏道：“大约有意思的了。”冯紫英道：“我今儿从吏部里来，也听见这样说。雨村老先生是贵本家不是？”贾政道：“是。”冯紫英道：“是有服的，还是无服的？”贾政道：“说也话长。他原籍是浙江湖州府人，流寓到苏州，甚不得意。有个甄士隐和他相好，时常周济他。以后中了进士，得了榜下知县，便娶了甄家的丫头。如今的太太不是正配。岂知甄士隐弄到零落不堪，没有找处。雨村革了职以后，那时还与我家并未相识，只因舍妹丈林如海林公在扬州巡盐的时候，请他在家做西席，外甥女儿是他的学生。因他有起复的信，要进京来，恰好外甥女儿要上来探亲，林姑老爷便托他照应上来的，还有一封荐书托我吹嘘吹嘘。那时看他不错，大家常会。岂知雨村也奇：我家世袭起，从‘代’字辈下来，宁荣两宅，人口房舍，以及起居事宜，一概都明白。因此，遂觉得亲热了。”因又笑说道：“几年间，门子也会钻了，由知府推升转了御史，不过几年，升了吏部侍郎，兵部尚书。为着一件事降了三级，如今又要升了。”\n    冯紫英道：“人世的荣枯，仕途的得失，总属难定。”贾政道：“天下事都是一个样的理哟。比如方才那珠子，那颗大的就象有福气的人似的，那些小的都托赖着他的灵气护庇着。要是那大的没有了，那些小的也就没有收揽了。就象人家儿当头人有了事，骨肉也都分离了，亲戚也都零落了，就是好朋友也都散了。转瞬荣枯，真似春云秋叶一般。你想做官有什么趣儿呢！象雨村算便宜的了。还有我们差不多的人家儿，就是甄家，从前一样功勋，一样世袭，一样起居，我们也是时常来往。不多几年他们进京来，差人到我这里请安，还很热闹。一会儿抄了原籍的家财，至今杳无音信。不知他近况若何，心下也着实掂记着。”贾赦道：“什么珠子？”贾政同冯紫英又说了一遍给贾赦听。贾赦道：“咱们家是再没有事的。”冯紫英道：“果然尊府是不怕的。一则里头有贵妃照应；二则故旧好，亲戚多；三则你们家自老太太起，至于少爷们，没有一个刁钻刻薄的。”贾政道：“虽无刁钻刻薄的，却没有德行才情。白白的衣租食税，那里当得起？”贾赦道：“咱们不用说这些话，大家吃酒罢。”\n　　大家又喝了几杯，摆上饭来。吃毕喝茶，冯家的小厮走来，轻轻的向紫英说了一句。冯紫英便要告辞。贾赦问那小厮道：“你说什么？”小厮道：“外面下雪，早已下了梆子了。”贾政叫人看时，已是雪深一寸多了。贾政道：“那两件东西，你收拾好了么？”冯紫英道：“收好了。若尊府要用，价钱还自然让些。”贾政道：“我留神就是了。”紫英道：“我再听信罢。天气冷，请罢，别送了。”贾赦贾政便命贾琏送了出去。未知后事如何，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After leaving Bamboo Lodge, Baoyu asked Qiuwen, “What did my father want me for?”\n\n“He didn’t,” she said with a smile. “It was Sister Xiren who told me to fetch you. I was afraid you wouldn’t come, so I made that up.”\n\nMuch relieved he said, “You could just have asked me; why frighten me like that?” He went on then to Happy Red Court.\n\nXiren asked, “Where have you been all this time?”\n\n“I was with Miss Lin, and we got talking about Aunt Xue and Cousin Bacchai — that’s why I stayed so long.”\n\n“What did you talk about?”\n\nHe described their exchange of Zen Buddhist repartee.\n\n“You two have no sense,” she scolded. “Why can’t you talk about ordinary things or discuss poetry? Why must you talk about Zen? You’re not a monk.”\n\n“You don’t understand. We have our own mystic enlightenment which no one else can share.”\n\nXiren smiled. “If you get carried away by Zen, we’ll be left in the dark.”\n\n“I used to be young and she was childish too,” he said, “so if I spoke carelessly she would take offence. Now I’m more careful and she doesn’t lose her temper. But she seldom comes here nowadays, and I have to study, so on the rare occasions when we meet we seem to be growing estranged.”\n\n“That’s only right. You’re both several years older; you can’t go on behaving like children.”\n\n“I know. But let’s not talk about that. Did the old lady send anyone with a message?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“She must have forgotten. Tomorrow’s the first of the eleventh month, isn’t it? Every year at this time she holds that party to keep out the cold when they all sit together drinking and chatting. I’ve asked for leave from school today. But if there’s no word, should I go tomorrow or not? If I do, I’ll have asked for leave for nothing; if I don’t and my father finds out, he’ll accuse me of playing truant.”\n\n“I think you should go,” said Xiren. “You’ve just been doing a little better at your lessons, and now you want to slack. I think you should put yourself out a bit. Yesterday I heard Her Ladyship say that young Lan is studying very well. When he comes back from school he goes on reading and writing essays, and doesn’t go to bed till after the fourth watch. You’re much older and his uncle too; so if you can’t keep up with him, the old lady will be angry. You’d better get up early tomorrow and go to school.”\n\nSheyue put in, “It’s so cold, and since you’ve asked for leave, if you go the school will think: In that case why ask for leave? Obviously it was just a trick to get out of going. Why not take a day off for a change? Even if the old lady has forgotten, can’t we have a cold-keeping party here too? Why can’t we enjoy ourselves?”\n\n“It’s you who started this,” Xiren told her. “Now of course he won’t go.”\n\n“I just believe in enjoying myself one day at a time,” retorted Sheyue. “I’m not like you, hankering after a fine reputation. You slave for a month and only get two extra taels of silver.”\n\n“You bitch!” cried Xiren. “We’re talking sense and you come out with this wicked nonsense.”\n\n“It’s not nonsense, I mean it for your sake.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“When the young master goes to school you mope, hoping he’ll be back soon to have a laugh with you. Don’t put on such airs now. I’ve seen through you.”\n\nXiren was starting to swear at her when a maid arrived from the Lady Dowager.\n\n, the maid said, \"The mistress wants Master Bao not to go to school tomorrow. She's inviting Aunt Xue over to amuse him, and most likely the young ladies will be coming too. They've invited Miss Xiangyun, Miss Xinger and Miss Li, who are coming to some winter party.\" Baoyu did not wait to hear her out.\n\n\"Of course!\" he cried gleefully. \"The old lady's in high spirits. Not going to school tomorrow is quite above-board too.\"\n\nXiren could hardly object to this.\n\nWhen the maid had gone, Baoyu who had been studying hard for the last few days was only too eager to have a holiday. And the news that Aunt Xue was coming made him think that surely Bacchai would come too. This delighted him.\n\n\"Let's turn in now so that I can get up early tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nNothing happened that night.\n\nThe next day, sure enough, he went first thing to pay his respects to the Lady Dowager, then called on his father and Lady Wang and told them that his grandmother had excused him from school that day. Jia Zheng said nothing and he slowly withdrew. But after a few steps he flew like the wind to his grandmother's apartments. Finding that none of the others had arrived, only Nanny Wang from Xifeng's place had brought Qiaojie with some young maids to pay her respects.\n\n\"My mother told me to come first to pay my respects and keep you company, madam, till she comes,\" said the child.\n\nThe old lady laughed.\n\n\"What a good child! I've been up for some time waiting, but no one's come yet except your Uncle Bao.\"\n\nThen the nurse said, \"Pay your respects to uncle, miss.\"\n\nQiaojie curtseyed to Baoyu, who returned her greeting and asked after her health.\n\nShe answered, \"I heard my mother say yesterday she wants to ask you over for a talk, uncle.\"\n\n\"What about?\"\n\n\"My mother says I've been learning to read for the last few years with Nanny Li, but she doesn't know whether I really can or not. I told her, yes, I can. When I read to her she said I was just pretending and didn't believe me, because I play about all day long — how could I know any characters? I don't think those characters matter, though. Even the Classic of Filial Piety is easy to read. But mother said I was fooling her, and she wants to ask you to test me when you have time, uncle.\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager laughed.\n\n\"Good child, your mother can't read, that's why she says you're fooling her. Tomorrow, get your uncle to test you in front of her; then she'll believe you.\"\n\n\"How many characters do you know?\" asked Baoyu.\n\n\"Over three thousand. I've read the Classic of Filial Piety, and in the last fortnight I've started on the Biographies of Eminent Women.\"\n\n\"Do you understand it? If not, I can explain it to you.\"\n\n\"An uncle should explain it to his niece,\" agreed the old lady.\n\nSo Baoyu began, \"No need to talk about Queen Wen and her consorts. Jiang Yuan, who took off her hairpins to await punishment, and Wuyan of the State of Qi who helped her husband to rule — they were both able and virtuous consorts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Qiaojie.\n\n\"As for talented women, there were Cao Dagu, Ban Jieyu, Cai Wenji and Xie Daoyun.\"\n\n\"Which were virtuous?\" she asked.\n\n\"Meng Guang with her hempen skirt and wooden hairpin; Bao Xuan's wife who fetched water from the well; Tao Kan's mother who cut off her hair to entertain a guest. Those who did not complain of poverty were the virtuous ones.\"\n\nQiaojie nodded approvingly.\n\n\"Then there were the unfortunate ones,\" he went on. \"Like Yue Chang with her broken mirror, Su Hui who wove a verse in a palindrome. And the filial ones like Mulan who went to war in place of her father, and Cao E who drowned herself while searching for her father's corpse. There are too many to mention.\"\n\nAt this point Qiaojie looked rather pensive. And when Baoyu told how Cao Shi cut off her nose to keep her chastity and how other women remained chaste widows, she listened even more soberly. Not wanting to depress her, he continued, \"Then there were the famous beauties like Wang Qiang, Xi Shi, Fan Su, Xiao Man, Jiang Xian, Zhuo Wenjun and Hong Fu — all these were\n\nJust as he was about to say “in the middle,” the Lady Dowager, seeing that Qiaojie had fallen silent, interposed, “That’s enough, no need to say any more. If you tell her too much, how can she remember it?”\n\n“Some of what Uncle Bao was telling me I’d already read, some not,” said Qiaojie. “Now that he’s explained the part I had read, I understand it even better.”\n\n“Of course you can read,” said Baoyu. “There’s no need to go into that.”\n\n“I heard Mamma say,” Qiaojie went on, “that our Xiaohong used to work for you, Uncle Bao, but Mamma took her over and hasn’t yet found anyone to replace her. She’s thinking of putting in Liu Wu’er to take her place, but doesn’t know if you’d be willing, uncle.”\n\nThis delighted Baoyu.\n\n“Just do as your mother says,” he replied with a smile. “Put in anyone you choose. Why ask whether I’m willing or not?” He told the Lady Dowager, “I can see from her looks and intelligence that this little niece of mine is going to outdo Xifeng one day, and she can read better too.”\n\n“It’s all right for girls to learn to read,” said the old lady. “But the important thing is needlework.”\n\n“I’m learning sewing from Nanny Liu,” said Qiaojie. “Such things as making flowers, pulling threads — though I’m not good at it yet, I can do some stitches.”\n\n“In a family like ours of course we don’t need to do our own sewing, but we should know how, so as not to be at the mercy of other people later on.”\n\nQiaojie assented and would have asked Baoyu to explain more of the Biographies of Virtous Women to her, but he seemed lost in thought and she did not like to disturb him. Do you know what Baoyu was thinking? It was this: Liu Wu’er had been unable to come to Happy Red Court the first time because she was ill. The second time, after Lady Wang had dismissed Qingwen, none of the girls with good looks had been chosen. Then he had seen her when she went with her mother to take some things to Qingwen at Wu Gui’s house, and had been struck by her delicate charm. Now, thanks to Xifeng’s thoughtfulness, she was to take Xiaohong’s place. This was an unexpected delight, and so he was rapt in thought.\n\nThe Lady Dowager, waiting for the others and wondering why they had not come, sent maids to hurry them up. Presently Li Wan arrived with her young sister-in-law, Tanchun, Xichun, Xiangyun and Daiyu. They paid their respects to the old lady and greeted each other. Aunt Xue alone was missing, so the Lady Dowager sent to invite her. And sure enough, she came bringing Baoqin. Baoyu paid his respects to her and inquired after her health, but noticed that neither Baochai nor Xiuyan was there.\n\nDaiyu asked, “Why didn’t Cousin Baochai come?”\n\nAunt Xue made the excuse that she was unwell. Xiuyan had stayed away because she knew that her aunt was there. Though Baoyu was worried by Baochai’s absence, the arrival of Daiyu pushed this from his mind.\n\nSoon later Lady Xing and Lady Wang arrived. When Xifeng heard that her mother-in-law and aunt were already there, not wanting to be late herself she sent Pinger first to ask leave, saying, “I was meaning to come, but I’ve a fever and will be a little late.”\n\n“If she’s unwell, she needn’t come,” said the Lady Dowager. “It’s time now for our meal.”\n\nThe maids moved the brazier back and two tables were laid in a row in front of the old lady’s couch. They took their seats in due order and, the meal finished, sat round the fire to chat. But we need not dwell on that.\n\nWhy had Xifeng really not come? First, because she was ashamed to arrive after Lady Xing and Lady Wang. Then Lai Wang’s wife had come to report, “Miss Yingchun has sent someone to ask after you, madam. She says she isn’t going to the old lady’s place but is coming straight here.”\n\nXifeng, wondering what this meant, had the maid brought in.\n\n“Is your young lady well?” she asked.\n\n“How can she be well?”\n\n\"It was the young lady who sent me, but actually Siqi’s mother begged me to come and ask for your help, madam.”\n\n“Siqi has already been dismissed, why come to me?” asked Xifeng.\n\n“Since she left she’s done nothing but weep,” was the answer. “Then one day her cousin turned up. When her mother set eyes on him she was furious and accused him of ruining Siqi, seizing hold of him to give him a beating. The young fellow didn’t dare protest. But Siqi, hearing them, hurried out and, hard as it is to believe, told her mother, ‘I left home for his sake, but I hate him too for having no sense of honour. Now that he’s here, if you beat him, mother, you may as well strangle me first.’\n\n“Her mother swore, ‘You shameless slut! What are you up to now?’\n\n“Siqi said, ‘A woman can only marry once. I slipped up and he took me in; but since I’m his now I’ll never belong to anyone else. I hate him for being so spineless — a man should answer for his own mistakes; why did he run away? Even if he never came back, I’d never marry another. If you tried to force me, I’d kill myself. Now that he’s here, ask him what he means to do. If he hasn’t changed, let me kowtow to you, mother, as if I were dead, and I’ll follow him wherever he goes. I wouldn’t mind even if we had to beg for food.’\n\n“Her mother was so angry she cried and cursed, ‘You’re my daughter, but I won’t let you have him. What can you do about it?’\n\n“Who could have imagined that the silly girl would dash her head against the wall? She cracked her skull, the blood gushed out, and she died.\n\n“Her mother wept, but it was too late to save her, and she wanted her nephew to pay for it with his life. But he said something even stranger.\n\n“‘Don’t worry,’ he told them. ‘I made money outside and came back because I was thinking of her — that shows my heart’s in the right place. If you don’t believe me, just look.’ With that he took a case of gold trinkets and pearls from his pocket.\n\n“At sight of this her mother softened and said, ‘Why didn’t you speak up before?’\n\n“He answered, ‘Most women are fickle. If I’d told her I had money, she might have married me for that. As it was, she proved truly constant, a rare thing. I’ll give you this jewellery to buy a coffin for her.’\n\n“Siqi’s mother took the case and, not worrying about her daughter any more, let him make the arrangements. But then he had two coffins brought.\n\n“In surprise she asked why two were needed.\n\n“He said with a smile, ‘One isn’t enough. It takes two to do the job properly.’\n\n“As he wasn’t weeping either, she thought grief must have deranged him. But after preparing Siqi’s body for the coffin, quite calmly without any tears, while no one was watching he cut his throat with a small knife he had and killed himself.\n\n“Then Siqi’s mother started lamenting her folly, but it was too late. Now that the ward authorities know of this, they mean to report it to the court. In her desperation she begged me to ask you, madam, to put in a good word for her. She’ll come to kowtow her thanks.”\n\nAmazed, Xifeng exclaimed, “What fools such girls are! And to think she met a fool of a fellow too! No wonder that day when those things were discovered she didn’t turn a hair. So she was a girl of spirit! Of course, I’ve no time to bother with such silly business; but the way you told the story was really rather touching. All right, you can go back and tell her that I’ll speak to the second master and send Wang Er to clear up this trouble for her.”\n\nHaving dismissed the woman she went over to the Lady Dowager, and we need say no more about that.\n\nNow let us return to Jia Zheng, who was playing chess that day with Zhan Guang. The outcome of the game was still in the balance, and they were fighting for one corner.\n\nJust then a young page came in to announce, “Master Feng is outside asking to see you, sir.”\n\n“Ask him in,” said Jia Zheng.\n\nThe page went out to usher in Feng Ziying, who was met by Jia Zheng at the door. When Feng Ziying saw that they were playing chess he said, “Don’t let me disturb you. I’ll watch the game.”\n\n“My poor play isn’t worth watching,” Zhan Guang demurred.\n\n“Don’t say that. Please go ahead,” Feng Ziying urged.\n\n“Is there something you want to see me about?” Jia Zheng asked.\n\n“Nothing at all. Please go on with your game, uncle, and let me learn a few moves.”\n\n“Master Feng is a good friend of ours,” Jia Zheng told Zhan Guang. “Since he has no business to discuss, let’s finish this game and have a chat while he watches.”\n\n“Are you playing for stakes?” inquired Feng Ziying.\n\n“Yes,” said Zhan Guang.\n\n“In that case I mustn’t put in my word.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” Jia Zheng assured him. “He’s lost about ten taels but never pays up, so we’ll just have to punish him by making him stand us a meal.”\n\n“That’s all right then.”\n\n“Are you playing level, uncle?” asked Feng Ziying.\n\n“We used to, but he lost. Then I gave him two stones and still he lost. He often wants to take moves back, and gets quite worked up if I won’t let him.”\n\n“That’s not true,” protested Zhan Guang with a laugh.\n\n“Just you wait and see.”\n\nAmid general laughter they finished the game and worked out the score: Zhan Guang, who had taken first move, had lost by seven stones.\n\n“This game you lost through those knots,” commented Feng Ziying. “You had fewer knots, uncle, so you gained by it.”\n\n“Excuse us,” said Jia Zheng now. “Let’s have a talk.”\n\n“It’s some time since I saw you last, uncle,” said Feng Ziying. “Calling today to pay my respects, I’ve brought along a fellow provincial from Guangxi who’s come to the capital for an audience. He has four foreign curios which would do as tribute. One is a twenty-four-leaf screen carved of red sandalwood. The centre of each leaf, though not jade, is the finest kind of crystal, engraved with landscapes, figures, buildings, flowers and birds. On each leaf are fifty or sixty girls in palace costume. It’s called ‘Spring Morning in the Han Palace.’ The features, hair-styles and costumes are exquisitely carved, and the setting is fine too. I thought the main hall in your Garden of Grand View could do with it. Then there’s a clock over three feet high with a little boy holding a time-table: when the time comes he announces it. And inside there are puppets who play music. But I haven’t brought those two big heavy things along. The two I have with me are more interesting.”\n\nHe produced from his pocket an embroidered box wrapped in several layers of silk. When he unwrapped it, the first thing seen was a glass box with a gold stand and a red silk base, on which lay a pearl as big as a longan, dazzlingly bright.\n\n“They call this a ‘mother pearl,’” he said, and called for a plate.\n\nZhan Guang promptly brought a black lacquer tea-tray.\n\n“Will this do?” he asked.\n\n“Yes.” Feng Ziying took a white silk package from his pocket and emptied its contents of some small pearls on to the tray; then he put the big pearl in the centre and set the tray on the table. To their amazement, all the small pearls gravitated towards the big one and clung to it, even when the tray was tilted.\n\n“This is fantastic!” exclaimed Zhan Guang.\n\n“This does happen,” said Jia Zheng. “That’s why it’s called a ‘mother pearl.’”\n\n‘It’s the mother pearl.’\n\nFeng turned to the page who had accompanied him. ‘Where is the box?’ he asked. The boy promptly handed him a rosewood box. They opened it. Inside, the box was lined with a tiger-patterned brocade, and on top of this lay a folded length of blue gauze.\n\n‘What is this?’ asked Zhan Guang.\n\n‘It’s called a Mermaid Silk Canopy,’ replied Feng.\n\nHe took it out of the box. It was folded up into a small package, less than five inches long and not even half an inch thick. Feng started unfolding it, layer after layer. When he had unfolded a dozen or so layers, the canopy had already grown too big for the table.\n\n‘Look,’ he said, ‘there are still two more folds to go. We shall need a high ceiling to be able to unfold it completely. It’s woven from mermaid thread. If you hang it in your hall in the summer, it will keep out every fly and mosquito. And it’s so light and bright.’\n\n‘Don’t unfold it any further,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It will be such a job folding it up again.’\n\nZhan Guang helped Feng fold it up again and put it away.\n\n‘None of these four things is very expensive,’ said Feng. ‘The fellow is only asking twenty thousand. Ten thousand for the mother pearl, five for the mermaid silk and five for the scroll and the clock.’\n\n‘We could never afford that!’ exclaimed Jia Zheng.\n\n‘But you are related to the Imperial Family!’ protested Feng. ‘Surely you have a use for things like this in the Palace?’\n\n‘We may have a use for them,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but we certainly don’t have the money to pay for them. I shall send for Lian and have him take these two things in to show Her Old Ladyship.’\n\n‘Very good,’ said Feng.\n\nJia Zheng sent one of his men to find Jia Lian and bring him there. He told him to take the two objects to the Lady Dowager, and also to invite Ladies Xing and Wang and Xi-feng to come and look at them. They were to try them out and see how they worked.\n\n‘There are two other things as well,’ said Jia Lian. ‘A twelve-leaf screen and a musical chiming-clock. The lot will cost you twenty thousand.’\n\nXi-feng (who had by now arrived on the scene and been told what was going on) joined in at this point:\n\n‘Oh they’re very fine, I’m sure. But where are we to find that kind of money? We’re not like one of those governorships that have to think about sending tribute. I’ve been thinking for years that a family like ours ought to be investing in a few things that can’t run away — a bit of sacrificial land, or some charity farms, or a burial-ground. Then if times should ever get hard for our children and grandchildren, they’d at least have something to fall back on and wouldn’t be utterly destitute. That’s my opinion, for what it’s worth. Of course, if Their Ladyships think differently and if the gentlemen outside want to buy these things, then by all means let them go ahead and buy.’\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the rest all agreed that this was very sensible.\n\n‘Send them back then,’ said Jia Lian. ‘Uncle only asked me to bring them in for Her Old Ladyship to look at because he thought they might be suitable for presentation at the Palace. No one ever said anything about buying them to keep in the house. Her Old Ladyship hasn’t even expressed an opinion yet, and here are you holding forth and casting a gloom over everything with your miserable talk.’\n\nHe carried the two things outside again and, merely informing Jia Zheng that ‘Grandmother doesn’t want them’, told Feng Zi-ying:\n\n‘They’re very fine things, but we just don’t have the money. I’ll bear it in mind, though. If I hear of a prospective customer, I’ll send word to you.’\n\nFeng had to be content with that. He packed the things away again and sat talking for a while, but the heart had gone out of him and he very soon rose to take his leave.\n\n‘Won’t you stay for dinner?’ said Jia Zheng.\n\n‘Oh no, I really couldn’t put you to so much trouble,’ said Feng.\n\n‘Come, come!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That is no way to talk.’\n\nAs he was speaking, a servant announced that Sir She had arrived, and almost immediately Jia She himself walked in. Having exchanged a few words of greeting, the company sat down. Wine was served and various dishes were set out, and they began drinking. After several rounds the conversation turned once more to the foreign goods.\n\n‘That sort of merchandise is always rather difficult to get rid of,’ Feng was saying. ‘In my opinion the only families who could take it off your hands are ones like yours. I can’t think of any others.’\n\n‘I’m not so sure about that,’ said Jia Zheng.\n\n‘We are not as well off as we used to be,’ said Jia She. ‘Nowadays ours is a rather hollow splendour.’\n\n\"How is Master Zhen of the East Mansion?\" asked Feng Ziying. \"I saw him the other day and when we were chatting he mentioned that his son's new wife is not nearly as good as the former one, Lady Qin. Which family is this new wife from? I forgot to ask.\"\n\n\"Our grand-nephew's wife is from a well-known family too,\" replied Jia Zheng. \"She is the daughter of Mr. Hu, the former Governor of the Metropolitan District.\"\n\n\"I know Governor Hu, but his family's style of upbringing is nothing to boast of. Still, that doesn't matter so long as the girl is good.\"\n\nJia Lian put in, \"I heard from someone in the Grand Secretariat that Yucun is to be promoted again.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said Jia Zheng. \"Is it definite?\"\n\n\"Most likely.\"\n\nFeng Ziying said, \"I heard the same today in the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Is Mr. Yucun a member of your honourable clan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jia Zheng.\n\n\"Is he a close relation?\"\n\n\"It's a long story. His family comes from Huzhou in Zhejiang but he lived in Suzhou, where he was rather hard up. A good friend of his, Zhen Shiyin, often helped him out. After he passed the metropolitan examination and was appointed a magistrate, he married a maid from the Zhen family; so his present wife is not his first. Later Zhen Shiyin fell on bad times and disappeared. After Yucun had been cashiered, before we knew him, my brother-in-law Lin Ruhai who was then in Yangchow as Salt Commissioner engaged him as his daughter's tutor. And when he received news of his reinstatement and had to come to the capital, just then my niece was coming here to visit us; so Lin Ruhai asked him to escort her and gave me a letter recommending him. We saw then that he was a good sort and often invited him over. The remarkable thing is that Yucun knows all about our family: the two mansions of Ningguo and Rongguo, the number of people in them and all our domestic affairs ever since the title was first conferred on our forefathers in the time of Dai. That's why we've become quite close.\" He smiled. \"In the last few years he's learned how to climb. Starting as a prefect he was promoted to Censor, then after a few years to Vice-Minister of Civil Affairs, and then to Minister of War. But he was demoted three grades on account of some charge, and now he's to be promoted again.\"\n\n\"Wealth and honour, success and failure in official career are all predestined,\" observed Feng Ziying.\n\n\"The same principle applies to everything under heaven,\" said Jia Zheng. \"Take those pearls, for instance. The big one is like a man of good fortune, the small ones depend on his luck and are protected by him. When the big one is lost, the small ones scatter. It's the same with families: if the head of the house is in trouble, his flesh and blood are scattered, his relatives and friends vanish. The changes of fortune are as sudden as the clouds in spring or the leaves in autumn. What pleasure is there in being an official? Yucun has done well for himself. Then take a family like ours, or the Zhens who had the same honours and emoluments as ourselves and with whom we were on familiar terms. A few years ago when they came to the capital and called to pay their respects, it was still a lively gathering. But now their property has been confiscated and we've had no news of them. I've no idea how they are faring, and it preys on my mind.\"\n\n\"What pearls were those?\" asked Jia She.\n\nJia Zheng and Feng Ziying told him.\n\n\"Our family will never come to grief,\" said Jia She.\n\n\"Of course your honourable house is quite secure,\" Feng Ziying assured him. \"In the first place, you have the Imperial Consort at court. In the second, you have so many old friends and relatives. And in the third, from the Old Lady down to the young gentlemen, none of you is crafty or grasping.\"\n\nJia She continued, “He may be good-looking but he’s lacking in virtue and intelligence. He just lives off his rents and taxes — how could he be worthy?”\n\n“Let’s not talk about such things,” said Jia She. “Let’s enjoy our wine.”\n\nAfter a few more rounds of drinks rice was served, and after the meal they had tea. Then a servant of Feng Ziying’s came in and whispered to him. Feng asked to be excused.\n\n“What did he say?” Jia She asked the servant.\n\n“It’s snowing outside, sir, and the first watch has been announced.”\n\nJia Zheng sent to have a look and found that the snow was already more than an inch deep.\n\n“Have you put those two things away safely?” he asked Feng Ziying.\n\n“Yes. If your honourable house should want them, of course I’d reduce the price.”\n\n“I’ll bear it in mind.”\n\n“I shall await your decision then. It’s cold; please keep inside. Don’t see me out.”\n\nJia She and Jia Zheng ordered Jia Lian to see him off. If you want to know the sequel, read the next chapter."
