  "original": "话说林黛玉自与宝玉口角后也觉后悔，但又无去就他之理，因此日夜闷闷如有所失。紫鹃也看出八九，便劝道：“论前儿的事，竟是姑娘太浮躁了些。别人不知宝玉的脾气，难道咱们也不知道？为那玉也不是闹了一遭两遭了。”黛玉啐道：“呸！你倒来替人派我的不是。我怎么浮躁了？”紫鹃笑道：“好好儿的，为什么铰了那穗子？不是宝玉只有三分不是，姑娘倒有七分不是？我看他素日在姑娘身上就好，皆因姑娘小性儿，常要歪派他才这么样。”黛玉欲答话，只听院外叫门。紫鹃听了听，笑道：“这是宝玉的声音，想必是来赔不是来了。”黛玉听了，说：“不许开门！”紫鹃道：“姑娘又不是了，这么热天毒日头地下，晒坏了他，如何使得呢。”口里说着，便出去开门，果然是宝玉。一面让他进来，一面笑着说道：“我只当宝二爷再不上我们的门了，谁知道这会子又来了。”宝玉笑道：“你们把极小的事情倒说大了，好好的为什么不来？我就死了，魂也要一日来一百遭。妹妹可大好了？”紫鹃道：“身上病好了，只是心里气还不大好。”宝玉笑道：“我知道了，有什么气呢。”一面说着，一面进来。只见黛玉又在床上哭。\n　　那黛玉本不曾哭，听见宝玉来，由不得伤心，止不住滚下泪来。宝玉笑着走近床来道：“妹妹身上可大好了？”黛玉只顾拭泪，并不答应。宝玉因便挨在床沿上坐了，一面笑道：“我知道你不恼我，但只是我不来，叫旁人看见，倒象是咱们又拌了嘴的似的。要等他们来劝咱们，那时候儿岂不咱们倒觉生分了？不如这会子你要打要骂，凭你怎么样，千万别不理我！”说着，又把“好妹妹”叫了几十声。黛玉心里原是再不理宝玉的，这会子听见宝玉说“别叫人知道咱们拌了嘴就生分了似的”这一句话，又可见得比别人原亲近，因又掌不住，便哭道：“你也不用来哄我！从今以后，我也不敢亲近二爷，权当我去了。”宝玉听了笑道：“你往那里去呢？”黛玉道：“我回家去。”宝玉笑道：“我跟了去。”黛玉道：“我死了呢？”宝玉道：“你死了，我做和尚。”黛玉一闻此言，登时把脸放下来，问道：“想是你要死了，胡说的是什么？你们家倒有几个亲姐姐亲妹妹呢！明儿都死了，你几个身子做和尚去呢？等我把这个话告诉别人评评理。”宝玉自知说的造次了，后悔不来，登时脸上红涨，低了头不敢作声。幸而屋里没人。\n　　黛玉两眼直瞪瞪的瞅了他半天，气的“嗳”了一声，说不出话来。见宝玉憋的脸上紫涨，便咬着牙，用指头狠命的在他额上戳了一下子，“哼”了一声，说道：“你这个……”刚说了三个字，便又叹了一口气，仍拿起绢子来擦眼泪。宝玉心里原有无限的心事，又兼说错了话，正自后悔，见黛玉戳他一下子，要说也说不出来，自叹自泣，因此自己也有所感，不觉掉下泪来。要用绢子揩拭，不想又忘了带来，便用衫袖去擦。黛玉虽然哭着，却一眼看见他穿着簇新藕合纱衫，竟去拭泪，便一面自己拭泪，一面回身枕上搭的一方绡帕拿起来向宝玉怀里一摔，一语不发，仍掩面而泣。宝玉见他摔了帕子来，忙接住拭了泪，又挨近前些，伸手拉了他一只手，笑道：“我的五脏都揉碎了，你还只是哭。走罢，我和你到老太太那里去罢。”黛玉将手一摔道：“谁和你拉拉扯扯的！一天大似一天，还这么涎皮赖脸的，连个理也不知道。”\n　　一句话没说完，只听嚷道：“好了！”宝、黛两个不防，都唬了一跳。回头看时，只见凤姐儿跑进来，笑道：“老太太在那里抱怨天，抱怨地，只叫我来瞧瞧你们好了没有，我说：‘不用瞧，过不了三天，他们自己就好了。’老太太骂我，说我懒，我来了，果然应了我的话了。也没见你们两个！有些什么可拌的，三日好了，两日恼了，越大越成了孩子了。有这会子拉着手哭的，昨儿为什么又成了‘乌眼鸡’似的呢？还不跟着我到老太太跟前，叫老人家也放点儿心呢。”说着，拉了黛玉就走。黛玉回头叫丫头们，一个也没有。凤姐道：“又叫他们做什么，有我伏持呢。”一面说，一面拉着就走，宝玉在后头跟着。\n　　出了园门，到了贾母跟前，凤姐笑道：“我说他们不用人费心，自己就会好的，老祖宗不信，一定叫我去说和。赶我到那里说和，谁知两个人在一块儿对赔不是呢，倒象‘黄鹰抓住鹞子的脚’，两个人都‘扣了环’了！那里还要人去说呢？”说的满屋里都笑起来。\n　　此时宝钗正在这里，那黛玉只一言不发，挨着贾母坐下。宝玉没什么说的，便向宝钗笑道：“大哥哥好日子，偏我又不好，没有别的礼送，连个头也不磕去。大哥哥不知道我病，倒象我推故不去似的。倘或明儿姐姐闲了，替我分辩分辩。”宝钗笑道：“这也多事，你就要去，也不敢惊动，何况身上不好。弟兄们常在一处，要存这个心倒生分了。”宝玉又笑道：“姐姐知道体谅我就好了。”又道：“姐姐怎么不听戏去？”宝钗道：“我怕热。听了两出，热的很，要走呢，客又不散；我少不得推身上不好，就躲了。宝玉听说，自己由不得脸上没意思，只得又搭讪笑道：“怪不得他们拿姐姐比杨妃，原也富胎些。”宝钗听说，登时红了脸，待要发作，又不好怎么样；回思了一回，脸上越下不来，便冷笑了两声，说道：“我倒象杨妃，只是没个好哥哥好兄弟可以做得杨国忠的！”正说着，可巧小丫头靓儿因不见了扇子，和宝钗笑道：“必是宝姑娘藏了我的。好姑娘，赏我罢。”宝钗指着他厉声说道：”你要仔细，你见我和谁玩过，有和你素日嘻皮笑脸的那些姑娘们，你该问他们去！”说的靓儿跑了。宝玉自知又把话说造次了，当着许多人，比才在黛玉跟前更不好意思，便急回身，又向别人搭讪去了。\n　　黛玉听见宝玉奚落宝钗，心中着实得意，才要搭言，也趁势取个笑儿，不想靓儿因找扇子，宝钗又发了两句话，他便改口说道：“宝姐姐，你听了两出什么戏？”宝钗因见黛玉面上有得意之态，一定是听了宝玉方才奚落之言，遂了他的心愿。忽又见他问这话，便笑道：“我看的是李逵骂了宋江，后来又赔不是。”宝玉便笑道：“姐姐通今博古，色色都知道，怎么连这一出戏的名儿也不知道，就说了这么一套。这叫做《负荆请罪》。”宝钗笑道：“原来这叫‘负荆请罪’！你们通今博古，才知道‘负荆请罪’，我不知什么叫‘负荆请罪’。”一句话末说了，宝玉、黛玉二人心里有病，听了这话，早把脸羞红了。凤姐这些上虽不通，但只看他三人的形景，便知其意，也笑问道：“这们大热的天，谁还吃生姜呢？”众人不解，便道：“没有吃生姜的。”凤姐故意用手摸着腮，诧异道：“既没人吃生姜，怎么这么辣辣的呢？”宝玉、黛玉二人听见这话，越发不好意思了。宝钗再欲说话，见宝玉十分羞愧，形景改变，也就不好再说，只得一笑收住。别人总没解过他们四个人的话来，因此付之一笑。\n　　一时宝钗、凤姐去了，黛玉向宝玉道：“你也试着比我利害的人了。谁都象我，心拙口夯的，由着人说呢！”宝玉正因宝钗多心，自己没趣儿，又见黛玉问着他，越发没好气起来。欲待要说两句，又怕黛玉多心，说不得忍气，无精打彩，一直出来。\n　　谁知目今盛暑之际，又当早饭已过，各处主仆人等多半都因日长神倦，宝玉背着手，到一处，一处鸦雀无声。从贾母这里出来往西，走过了穿堂便是凤姐的院落。到他院门前，只见院门掩着，知道凤姐素日的规矩，每到天热，午间要歇一个时辰的，进去不便。遂进角门，来到王夫人上房。只见几个丫头手里拿着针线，却打盹儿。王夫人在里间凉床上睡着，金钏儿坐在旁边捶腿，也斜着眼乱恍。宝玉轻轻的走到跟前，把他耳朵上的坠子一摘。金钏儿睁眼，见是宝玉，宝玉便悄俏的笑道：“就困的这么着？”金钏抿嘴儿一笑，摆手叫他出去，仍合上眼。宝玉见了他，就有些恋恋不舍的，悄俏的探头瞧瞧王夫人合着眼，便自己向身边荷包里带的香雪润津丹掏了一丸出来，向金钏儿嘴里一送，金钏儿也不睁眼，只管噙了。宝玉上来，便拉着手，悄悄的笑道：“我和太太讨了你，咱们在一处吧？”金钏儿不答。宝玉又道：“等太太醒了，我就说。”金钏儿睁开眼，将宝玉一推，笑道：“你忙什么？‘金簪儿掉在井里头，有你的只是有你的。’连这句俗语难道也不明白？我告诉你个巧方儿，你往东小院儿里头拿环哥儿和彩云去。”宝玉笑道：“谁管他的事呢！咱们只说咱们的。”\n　　只见王夫人翻身起来，照金钏儿脸上就打了个嘴巴，指着骂道：“下作小娼妇儿！好好儿的爷们，都叫你们教坏了！”宝玉见王夫人起来，早一溜烟跑了。这里金钏儿半边脸火热，一声不敢言语。登时众丫头听见王夫人醒了，都忙进来。王夫人便叫：“玉钏儿，把你妈叫来！带出你姐姐去。”金钏儿听见，忙跪下哭道：“我再不敢了！太太要打要骂，只管发落，别叫我出去，就是天恩了。我跟了太太十来年，这会子撵出去，我还见人不见人呢！”王夫人固然是个宽仁慈厚的人，从来不曾打过丫头们一下子，今忽见金钏儿行此无耻之事，这是平生最恨的，所以气忿不过，打了一下子，骂了几句。虽金钏儿苦求也不肯收留，到底叫了金钏儿的母亲白老媳妇儿领出去了。那金驯儿含羞忍辱合的出去，不在话下。\n　　且说宝玉见王夫人醒了，自己没趣，忙进大观园来。只见赤日当天，树阴匝地，满耳蝉声，静无人语。刚到了蔷薇架，只听见有人哽噎之声。宝玉心中疑惑，便站住细听，果然那边架下有人。此时正是五月，那蔷薇花叶茂盛之际，宝玉悄悄的隔着药栏一看，只见一个女孩子蹲在花下，手里拿着根别头的簪子在地下抠士，一面悄悄的流泪。宝玉心中想道：“难道这也是个痴丫头，又象颦儿来葬花不成？”因又自笑道：“若真也葬花，可谓‘东施效颦’了，不但不为新奇，而且更是可厌。”想毕，便要叫那女子说：“你不用跟着林姑娘学了。”话未出口，幸而再看时，这女孩子面生，不是个侍儿，倒象是那十二个学戏的女孩子里头的一个，却辨不出他是生、旦、净、丑那一个脚色来。宝玉把舌头一伸，将口掩住，自己想道：“幸而不曾造次。上两回皆因造次了，颦儿也生气，宝儿也多心。今日再得罪了他们，越发没意思了。”一面想，一面又恨不认得这个是谁。再留神细看，见这女孩子眉蹙春山，眼颦秋水，面薄腰纤，袅袅婷婷，大有黛玉之态。宝玉早又不忍弃他而去，只管痴看。\n　　只见他虽然用金簪画地，并不是掘土埋花，竟是向土上画字。宝玉拿眼随着簪子的起落，一直到底，一画、一点，一勾的看了去，数一数，十八笔。自己又在手心里拿指头按着他方才下笔的规矩写了，猜是个什么字。写成一想，原来就是个蔷薇花的“蔷”字。宝玉想到：“必定是他也要作诗填词，这会子见了这花，因有所感。或者偶成了两句，一时兴至，怕忘了，在地下面着推敲也末可知。且看他底下再写什么。”一面想，一面又看，只见那女孩子还在那里画呢。画来画去，还是个“蔷”字；再看，还是个“蔷”字。里面的原是早已痴了，画完一个“蔷”又画一个“蔷”，已经画了有几十个。外面的不觉也看痴了，两个眼睛珠儿只管随着簪子动，心里却想：“这女孩子一定有什么说不出的心事，才这么个样儿。外面他既是这个样儿，心里还不知怎么熬煎呢？看他的模样儿这么单薄，心里那里还搁的住熬煎呢？可恨我不能替你分些过来。”\n　　却说伏中阴睛不定，片云可以致雨，忽然凉风过处，飒飒的落下一阵雨来。宝玉看那女孩子头上往下滴水，把衣裳登时湿了。宝玉想道：“这是下雨了，他这个身子，如何禁得骤雨一激。”因此禁不住便说道：“不用写了，你看身上都湿了。”那女孩子听说，倒唬了一跳，抬头一看，只见花外一个人叫他“不用写了”。一则宝玉脸面俊秀，二则花叶繁茂，上下俱被枝叶隐住，刚露着半边脸儿：那女孩子只当也是个丫头，再不想是宝玉，因笑道：“多谢姐姐提醒了我。难道姐姐在外头有什么遮雨的？”一句提醒了宝玉，“嗳哟”了一声，才觉得浑身冰凉。低头看看身己身上，也都湿了。说：“不好！”只得一气跑回恰红院去了。心里却还记挂着那女孩子没处避雨。\n　　原来明日是端阳节，那文官等十二个女孩子都放了学，进园来各处玩耍。可巧小生宝官正旦玉官两个女孩子，正在恰红院和袭人玩笑，被雨阻住，大家堵了沟，把水积在院内，拿些绿头鸭、花、彩鸳鸯，捉的捉，赶的赶，缝了翅膀，放在院内玩耍，将院门关了。袭人等都在游廊上嘻笑。宝玉见关着门，便用手扣门，里面诸人只顾笑，那里听见。叫了半日，拍得门山响，里面方听见了。料着宝玉这会子再不回来的，袭人笑道：“谁这会子叫门？没人开去。”宝玉道：“是我。”麝月道：“是宝姑娘的声音。”晴雯道：“胡说，宝姑娘这会子做什么来？”袭人道：“等我隔着门缝儿瞧瞧，可开就开，别叫他淋着回去。”说着，便顺着游廊到门前往外一瞧，只见宝玉淋得雨打鸡一般。袭人见了，又是着忙，又是好笑，忙开了门，笑着弯腰拍手道：“那里知道是爷回来了！你怎么大雨里跑了来？”\n　　宝玉一肚子没好气，满心里要把开门的踢几脚。方开了门，并不看真是谁，还只当是那些小丫头们，便一脚踢在肋上。袭人“嗳哟”了一声。宝玉还骂道：“下流东西们，我素日担待你们得了意，一点儿也不怕，越发拿着我取笑儿了！”口里说着，一低头见是袭人哭了，方知踢错了。忙笑道：“嗳哟！是你来了！踢在那里了？”袭人从来不曾受过一句大话儿的，今忽见宝玉生气踢了他一下子，又当着许多人，又是羞又是气又是疼，真一时置身无地。待要怎么样，料着宝玉未必是安心踢他，少不得忍着说道：“没有踢着，还不换衣裳去呢！”宝玉一面进房解衣，一面笑道：“我长了这么大，头一遭儿生气打人，不想偏偏儿就碰见你了。”袭人一面忍痛换衣裳，一面笑道：“我是个起头儿的人，也不论事大事小，是好是歹，自然也该从我起。但只是别说打了我，明日顺了手，只管打起别人来。”宝玉道：“我才也不是安心。”袭人道：“谁说是安心呢？素日开门关门的都是小丫头们的事，他们是憨皮惯了的，早已恨的人牙痒痒。他们没个怕惧，要是他们，踢一下子唬唬也好。刚才是我淘气，不叫开门的。”\n说着，那雨已住了，宝官、玉官也早去了。袭人只觉肋下疼的心里发闹，晚饭也不曾吃。到晚间脱了衣服，只见肋上青了碗大的一块，自己倒唬了一跳，又不好声张。一时睡下，梦中作痛，由不得“嗳哟”之声从睡中哼出。宝玉虽说不是安心，因见袭人懒懒的，心里也不安稳。半夜里听见袭人“嗳哟”，便知踢重了，自己下床来，悄捎的秉灯来照。刚到床前，只见袭人嗽了两声，吐出一口痰来，嗳哟一声。睁眼见了宝玉，倒唬了一跳，道：“作什么？”宝玉道：“你梦里‘嗳哟’，必是踢重了。我瞧瞧。”袭人道：“我头上发晕，嗓子里又腥又甜，你倒是照一照地下罢。”宝玉听说，果然持灯向地下一照，只见一口鲜血在地。宝玉慌了，只说：“了不得！”袭人见了，也就心冷了半截。\n要知端的，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After their quarrel Dai-yu too had been sorry and known that she was in the wrong. But there was no reason for her to go and apologize. She had been feeling listless and depressed all day, as if she had lost something. Her maid Nightingale had a shrewd idea of what was wrong.\n\n“I think you were too hasty the other day, miss,” she advised her. “Of course we know what Master Bao’s like even if others don’t. How many times has he flown into a passion over that jade of his?”\n\n“Pah!” Dai-yu spat in disgust. “You’re trying to put me in the wrong. Who was I hasty with?”\n\nNightingale smiled.\n\n“Before he came the other day you were perfectly all right; but why did you cut that cord off your pouch? If Master Bao was three parts to blame, weren’t seven parts of the blame yours? He’s always been so good to you, it’s only because you’re so touchy and keep flying out at him that this has happened.”\n\nDai-yu was about to retort when someone was heard calling outside the courtyard.\n\n“That’s Master Bao’s voice,” said Nightingale after listening. “I suppose he’s come to apologize.”\n\n“Don’t let him in.”\n\n“Now you’re being unreasonable again, miss. On a sweltering day like this, with the sun blazing down, you can’t let him get sunstroke.”\n\nAs she spoke she went to open the gate. And sure enough, there was Baoyu.\n\n“I thought you’d never set foot in our place again, Master Bao,” she teased. “Fancy your coming now!”\n\n“You’re making a mountain out of a molehill,” he replied with a smile. “Why shouldn’t I come? Even if I die, my ghost will be coming a hundred times a day. Is your young lady better?”\n\n“Physically, yes. But she’s still in a bad humour.”\n\n“I know she’s not one to bear a grudge.”\n\nAs he spoke he entered the room and saw that Dai-yu was crying again. She had not been crying before, but at the sight of Baoyu she could not hold back her tears.\n\nHe went up to the bed and leaned towards her.\n\n“Are you feeling better, dear cousin?” he asked gently.\n\nDai-yu, however, simply went on wiping her tears without a word.\n\nBaoyu perched on the edge of the bed.\n\n“I know you’re not really angry with me,” he said. “But if I didn’t come, other people might think we’d quarrelled again and wait to see which of us would give in first, as if we were strangers. If you wait for them to interfere, that will drive us further apart. Better beat me or scold me now if it will make you feel better, but do stop ignoring me!”\n\nHe went on calling her “dear cousin” a dozen times or more.\n\nDai-yu had meant to ignore him, but since he had spoken of “not letting other people think we’d quarrelled” — which showed that he was closer to her than the rest — she broke down completely.\n\n“Don’t come to coax me,” she sobbed. “I daren’t keep you company, Master Bao. I may as well die.”\n\n“Where would you go?” he asked with a smile.\n\n“Home.”\n\n“I’ll go with you.”\n\n“What if I die?”\n\n“If you die, I’ll become a monk.”\n\nAt this she lowered her head.\n\n“A fine thing to say! Now you’re really crazy. How many sisters have you? How could you become a monk? I’ll tell that to everyone and let them judge.”\n\nBaoyu knew at once that he had spoken too wildly. He flushed and hung his head. Luckily there was no one else in the room to hear.\n\nDai-yu glared at him in speechless anger, her eyes wide with indignation. She stamped her foot and pointed at him.\n\n“You!” she cried, gritting her teeth.\n\nShe sighed and once more raised her handkerchief to her eyes. Baoyu, who had been feeling remorseful for having distressed her again and was at a loss for words, was so affected by her weeping that he shed tears himself. He would have wiped them with his sleeve but had forgotten to bring a handkerchief. And Daiyu, though crying, had noticed that he was wearing a new lilac silk gown and was wiping his tears on the sleeve. She said nothing but, turning round, took the handkerchief from the pillow and tossed it to him without a word, then went on crying into her own handkerchief.\n\nBaoyu caught it quickly and wiped his tears.\n\n“My heart’s broken, yet you keep on crying,” he said, moving closer to take her hand. “Come on, let’s go and see the old lady.”\n\nDaiyu pushed him away.\n\n“Who wants to hold hands with you? You’re growing up, yet you still carry on in this shameless way.”\n\nJust then they heard someone cry, “Excellent!” and both gave a start. Turning they saw Xifeng sweep in.\n\n“The old lady’s been complaining to Heaven and Earth and sent me to see how you were,” she told them gaily. “I said, ‘Don’t worry, in less than three days they’ll be friends again.’ She called me a slacker. But now I’ve come, sure enough you’ve made it up. Why, brother, you’re holding our妹妹’s hand. Why were you glaring at each other yesterday like two fighting-cocks? Come with me now to see the old lady to set her mind at rest.”\n\nShe seized hold of Daiyu and started off. Daiyu turned to call her maids but not one was there.\n\n“What do you want with them?” asked Xifeng. “I’ll see to you.” And she swept her out of the room. Baoyu brought up the rear.\n\nThey found the Lady Dowager in her room and Xifeng announced with a smile:\n\n“I told you there was no need to worry, madam, they’d make it up by themselves. But you wouldn’t believe me and insisted on my going to talk them round. When I got there, I found they were apologizing to each other — clinging together like an eagle sinking its talons into a hawk. They didn’t need any help from me.” At that the whole party laughed.\n\nBaochai was present but Daiyu said nothing, simply taking a seat by the old lady. Baoyu, at a loss whom to talk to, remarked to Baochai:\n\n“It was too bad my illness kept me from Cousin Pan’s birthday party. I couldn’t send any presents or even go to kowtow. I’m afraid he may think I stayed away on purpose. If you’ve time tomorrow, sister, do explain it to him.”\n\n“There’s no need,” said Baochai. “It wouldn’t have mattered if you had gone. They’re all family — why stand on ceremony? If you were to keep up such formalities it would seem rather odd.”\n\n“That’s very kind of you,” he replied. “Well, why aren’t you watching the opera?”\n\n“I couldn’t stand the heat. After a couple of items I came away. But the guests weren’t dispersing, so I had to pretend I was unwell.”\n\nBaoyu, feeling snubbed, observed thoughtlessly, “No wonder they compare you to Lady Yang. You’re plump and怕热怕热。”\n\nBaochai flushed. She would have liked to rebuke him but not knowing how and feeling increasingly put out, she gave a scornful laugh.\n\nShe’s like Lady Yang, only without a brother or cousin like Yang Guozhong.” As he was speaking, it so happened that the young maid Liang-er, who had mislaid her fan, came up to Pao-chai with a smile.\n\n“You must have hidden it, miss,” she said. “Do let me have it back.”\n\nPao-chai pointed at her angrily. “You be careful,” she snapped. “When have I ever played about with you? You should ask those other young ladies who are always giggling and making up to you.”\n\nLiang-er ran off. Pao-yu knew that once again he had been too outspoken. To have this happen in front of so many people was even more upsetting than his recent blunder with Tai-yu. He turned away at once to talk to someone else.\n\nTai-yu was delighted to hear Pao-yu tease Pao-chai. She was just about to join in and have some fun too when Liang-er came up about her fan. And after Pao-chai’s retort she changed her tune.\n\n“What operas have you been seeing, cousin?” she asked.\n\nPao-chai could tell from Tai-yu’s smug expression that she was pleased by Pao-yu’s gibe. Now that Tai-yu asked this question, she answered with a smile:\n\n“I saw Li Kuei abusing Sung Chiang and then apologizing.”\n\n“What an expert you are, sister, in the classics as well as modern literature!” put in Pao-yu, smiling. “How is it you don’t know the name of this opera and just describe the plot? It’s called The Apology.”\n\n“So that’s its name, is it?” Pao-chai smiled too. “Well, you two are the experts, well versed in ancient and modern literature. So you know all about ‘apologies.’ I’ve no idea what an ‘apology’ is.”\n\nBefore the words were out of her mouth, Pao-yu and Tai-yu blushed, embarrassed by this hit. His-feng might be uneducated, but she could tell from the look of the other three what was in the wind.\n\n“Who’s been eating ginger on such a hot day?” she asked with a smile.\n\nThe others did not understand.\n\n“No one’s been eating ginger.”\n\nHis-feng put a hand to her cheek with a show of astonishment.\n\n“If no one’s been eating ginger, why are their faces so burning hot?”\n\nThis made Pao-yu and Tai-yu blush even more. Pao-chai was going to say something else, but when she saw how upset Pao-yu looked she held her tongue. And as the others had not understood the exchanges between these four, they simply let the matter drop with a smile.\n\nPresently Pao-chai and His-feng left.\n\n“Now you’ve met your match,” Tai-yu told Pao-yu. “Not everyone’s like me, so simple-minded and slow-witted that I let people say what they like.”\n\nPao-yu was already put out by Pao-chai’s sensitivity and in no mood for this further pin-prick from Tai-yu. He would have liked to retorted, but afraid of upsetting her he kept his temper and left in low spirits.\n\nIt so happened that this was the height of summer and, the morning meal being over, the master and servants in the different households were taking a nap and the place was very quiet. With his hands behind his back Pao-yu sauntered out of his grandmother’s gate and headed west past the corridor to His-feng’s compound. The gate was closed, for His-feng had the habit of taking a two-hour nap at noon in hot weather, so that admission at this time was difficult. He therefore went through the side gate to Lady Wang’s apartments. Here he found several maids napping over their needlework. His mother was sleeping on a cool couch and Chin-chuan, sitting beside her, was nodding as she massaged her legs.\n\nPao-yu tiptoed over to her and toyed with her ear-rings, making her open her eyes. When she saw who it was she smiled.\n\n“What makes you so sleepy?” he whispered.\n\nShe puckered up her lips to shush him, then with a smile waved him away and closed her eyes again.\n\nBut Pao-yu was loath to leave her. Gently peeping at his mother, who had her eyes closed, he took a fan from her side and fanned Chin-chuan.\n\nThen he took out a fragrant pill which he carried in a pouch at his waist and put it into Jinchuan’s mouth. She accepted it without opening her eyes.\n\nBaoyu caught hold of her hand and whispered with a smile:\n\n“I’ll ask my mother if I can have you, so that we can be together.”\n\nJinchuan made no reply.\n\n“I’ll ask her as soon as she wakes up,” he added.\n\nAt that Jinchuan opened her eyes and pushed him away.\n\n“What’s the hurry?” she cried. “‘A gold pin may fall into the well, but if it’s yours it remains yours.’ Can it be you don’t know that saying? Let me tell you how to get your way: Go and catch Master Huan and Caiyun in the east courtyard.”\n\n“Who cares what they do?” Baoyu chuckled. “Let’s talk about ourselves.”\n\nJust then Lady Wang sat up and slapped Jinchuan’s face. Pointing an accusing finger, she swore:\n\n“You low-class slut! A good boy like you would be led astray.”\n\nBaoyu had taken to his heels the instant his mother sat up. Jinchuan’s cheeks were burning, but she dared not say a word. And now all the other maids, hearing that Lady Wang was awake, hurried in. Lady Wang called for Yuchuan.\n\n“Go and fetch your mother to take your sister away,” she ordered.\n\nWhen Jinchuan heard this she fell on her knees.\n\n“I won’t do it again, madam,” she begged, weeping. “Beat me or curse me, punish me any way you like, but for pity’s sake don’t send me away. I’ve served you for ten years. If you drive me out now, how can I show my face?”\n\nAlthough Lady Wang was in fact the kindest of mistresses and had never beaten a maid, Jinchuan’s shameless behaviour had so enraged her that she had boxed her ears and sworn at her. And now, deaf to the girl’s entreaties, she insisted that Jinchuan’s mother Old Mrs. Bai should take her away. So Jinchuan had to leave in disgrace. But no more of this.\n\nBaoyu, having taken to his heels when his mother woke up, betook himself to the Garden. The sun was directly overhead, the ground was dappled with shade, a shrill chirring of cicadas filled the air, and all was still. As he approached the rose trellis he heard sobs. Wondering who could be grieving there, he halted to listen. Sure enough, someone was sobbing under the trellis. It was the fifth month and the roses were in bloom. Stealthily peering through the trellis, Baoyu saw a girl crouching on the ground. She was drawing characters in the dust with a hairpin. He could not see her face, but she seemed absorbed in this occupation as she wept.\n\n“Can this be another silly maid come to bury flowers like Taiyu?” he wondered. “If so, she’s ‘Tung Shih imitating Hsi Shih,’ which isn’t original but rather tiresome.” He was on the point of calling out, “Don’t take a leaf out of Miss Lin’s book!” when he realized just in time that this girl was a stranger. She was not one of the maids, but looked like one of the twelve young actresses from Pear Fragrance Court. He could not be sure, however, which role she played. Baoyu put a hand quickly over his mouth, his eyes wide with astonishment.\n\n“Lucky I didn’t speak too soon,” he thought. “The last two times I was too impulsive and offended Taiyu and Bacchai. If I offend this girl too, that will be the last straw.”\n\nBut who could she be? He stared at her more intently. She had finely arched eyebrows and limpid eyes, a slender waist and graceful figure. She looked very like Taiyu. He could not tear himself away, but stood watching her spellbound.\n\nShe was not digging in the ground with her gold pin but drawing characters with it. Following the movements of the pin, Baoyu counted the strokes.\n\nUp and down, beginning to end, he followed every line and dot of her tracings and counted eighteen strokes. Then with his finger he traced them on the palm of his hand in the same order, wondering what character it could be. As soon as he had worked it out he realized that it was the character qiang in “rose.”\n\n“She must want to write a poem or song,” he thought. “No doubt the sight of these flowers has inspired her, and if she’s hit on a couple of lines she may be afraid of forgetting them and is putting them down here to work on. Let’s see what she writes next.”\n\nAs he watched, the girl went on drawing. Back and forth, it was still the same character. She drew one “rose” after another, already a score of them, in such a transport that she was oblivious to everything else. And Baoyu outside was so rapt that he forgot where he was, his eyes fixed on that hair-pin as it moved.\n\n“She must have some unspoken anxiety preying on her mind to act in this strange way,” he reflected. “Why, looking so frail, how can she stand such passionate feeling? Poor thing! I wish I could bear some of this anguish for her.”\n\nNow in midsummer the weather is apt to change suddenly. A cloudlet can bring a shower. And a gust of cool wind now stirred the leaves, followed by a sudden downpour. Seeing the raindrops fall like pearls on the girl’s head till her whole dress was drenched, Baoyu thought, “With her delicate health she’s likely to catch cold in this rain.” He could not help calling out:\n\n“Stop writing! You’re getting wet.”\n\nSo startled by his voice was the girl that she looked up. There beyond the flowers was someone calling to her to stop writing. He had a handsome face, she observed, but he was half hidden by blossoms and foliage so that she could see only part of it. Taking him for one of the maids, she smiled.\n\n“Thanks for warning me. Isn’t there some shelter out there where you can take cover too?”\n\nOnly then, at her reminder, did Baoyu realize that he was soaked and shivering.\n\n“Oh!” he cried. “I’m getting wet.” He ran back then to Happy Red Court, worrying because the girl had no shelter from the rain.\n\nThe next day was the Dragon-Boat Festival. The twelve young actresses had a holiday and were amusing themselves in the Garden when the shower came on. Baoquan and Yuguan, two of the actresses, happened to be frolicking in Happy Red Court with Xiren and some other maids. The rain prevented them from leaving, so they stopped up the drain and caught the rain-water in the courtyard. They caught some drakes with green heads, speckled wild ducks and mandarin ducks, clipped their wings and were playing with them there behind closed doors. Xiren and the others were laughing on the verandah.\n\nWhen Baoyu found the gate closed and heard laughter inside, he knocked and called repeatedly but no one heard him. It was only when he hammered loudly on the door that they finally heard him.\n\n“Who can it be, this weather?” wondered Xiren. “We’d better not open.”\n\n“It’s me,” he shouted.\n\n“It sounds like Miss Baochai,” said Sheyue.\n\n“Nonsense!” retorted Qingwen. “Miss Baochai wouldn’t come in the rain.”\n\n“Let me look through the crack,” offered Xiren. “If it is we’ll open, if not we won’t. We mustn’t let her get drenched.”\n\nShe slipped along the verandah to the gate and, peeping out, saw Baoyu soaked and bedraggled. Amused and consternated, she hastily opened the gate. Stooping, she clapped her hands.\n\n“How were we to know it was you, sir?” she cried. “What made you come back in such a downpour?”\n\nBut Baoyu was too angry to...\n\nFuming, he was tempted to kick the porter. He threw open the gate without looking to see who was there and kicked the servant in the ribs, assuming it must be one of the younger maids. When he heard a cry of pain and saw that it was Xiren, he realized his mistake.\n\n“Aiya!” he apologized. “So it’s you. Where did I kick you?”\n\nXiren had never been scolded, let alone kicked. And to be kicked by Baoyu in front of everyone made her feel mortified, resentful and sore. She did not know what to do. But since she could hardly believe he had done it on purpose, she had to put up with it.\n\n“You didn’t hurt me,” she said. “You’d better change your clothes.”\n\nAs Baoyu went to his room to change he told her, “This is the first time in my life I’ve flown into a temper and hit anyone. I just didn’t expect it to be you.”\n\nXiren suppressed her pain to help him change. “That’s all right,” she said. “I’m the chief maid, so whether a thing’s important or not, good or bad, I should be the first to take the consequences. But I only hope you won’t go on to beat other people just because you started with me.”\n\n“I didn’t do it on purpose.”\n\n“Who says you did? Usually the younger maids open the gate. They’re so spoilt, they’ve long been asking for a kicking. They’ve no sense of respect. If it had been one of them, a kick might have scared some manners into her. It was my fault for not opening the gate myself just now.”\n\nBy now the rain had stopped and the two actresses had left. Xiren’s side was so painful that she felt queasy and could eat no supper. When she undressed that evening she saw a bruise on her ribs as big as a bowl. This gave her a fright, but she kept it to herself. She went to bed, but the pain kept her awake and she could not help groaning.\n\nAlthough Baoyu had not meant to hurt her, he was worried because she seemed so listless. When he heard her groans in the night he knew that she was badly hurt. He stole out of bed, lit a lamp and went to have a look. As he reached her bedside she coughed twice and produced some phlegm. Then with a little moan she exclaimed, “Aiya!” When she opened her eyes and saw Baoyu she started.\n\n“What are you doing here?” she asked.\n\n“You were groaning in your sleep,” he said. “I must have kicked you hard. Let me have a look.”\n\n“I feel dizzy and there’s a salty taste in my throat.”\n\nHe held the lamp to the floor and saw some fresh blood on it.\n\n“Good heavens!” he cried in consternation.\n\nAt this her heart failed her.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
