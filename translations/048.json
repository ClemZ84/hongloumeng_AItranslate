  "original": "话说薛蟠听见如此说了，气方渐平。三五日后，疼痛虽愈，伤痕未平，只装病在家，愧见亲友。\n　　展眼已到十月，因有各铺面伙计内有算年账要回家的，少不得家里治酒饯行。内有一个张德辉，自幼在薛蟠当铺内揽总，家内也有了二三千金的过活，今岁也要回家，明春方来。因说起：“今年纸札香料短少，明年必是贵的。明年先打发大小儿上来，当铺里照管，赶端阳前，我顺路就贩些纸札香扇来卖。除去关税花销，稍亦可以剩得几倍利息。”薛蟠听了，心下忖度：“如今我捱了打了正难见人，想着要躲避一年半截又没处去躲。天天装病，也不是常法儿。况且我长了这么大，文不文武不武，虽说做买卖，究竟戥子、算盘从没拿过，地土风俗、远近道路又不知道。不如也打点几个本钱和张德辉逛一年来，赚钱也罢，不赚钱也罢，且躲躲羞去。二则逛逛山水也是好的。”心内主意已定，至酒席散后，便和气平心与张德辉说知，命他等一二日，一同前往。晚间薛蟠告诉他母亲，薛姨妈听了，虽是喜欢，但又恐他在外生事，花了本钱倒是末事。因此不叫他去，只说：“你好歹跟着我，我还放心些。况且也不用这个买卖，等不着这几百银子使。”薛蟠主意已定，那里肯依？只说：“天天又说我不知世务，这个也不知，那个也不学；如今我发狠把那些没要紧的都断了，如今要成人立事，学习买卖，又不准我了。叫我怎么样呢？我又不是个丫头，把我关在家里，何日是个了手？况且那张德辉又是个有年纪的，咱们和他是世家，我同他怎么得有错，我就有一时半刻不好的去处，他自然说我劝我，就是东西贵贱行情，他是知道的，自然色色问他，何等顺利，倒不叫我去。过两日，我不告诉家里，私自打点了走，明年发了财回来，才知道我呢。”说毕，赌气睡觉去了。\n　　薛姨妈听他如此说，因和宝钗商议。宝钗笑道：“哥哥果然要经历正事，倒也罢了。只是他在家里说着好听，到了外头，旧病复发，难拘束他了。但也愁不得许多。他若是真改了，是他一生的福，若不改，妈妈也不能又有别的法子。一半尽人力，一半听天罢了。这么大人了，若只管怕他不知世路，出不得门，干不得事，今年关在家里，明年还是这个样儿。他既说的名正言顺，妈妈就打量着丢了一千、八百银子，竟交与他试一试。横竖有伙计帮着他，也未必好意思哄骗他的。二则他出去了，左右没了助兴的人，又没有倚仗的人，到了外头，谁还怕谁。有了的吃，没了的饿着，举眼无靠，他见了这样，只怕比在家里省了事也未可知。”薛姨妈听了，思付半晌道：“倒是你说的是。花两个钱叫他学些乖来也值。”商议已定，一窗无话。至次日，薛姨妈命人请了张德辉来在书房中，命薛蟠款待酒饭。自己在后廊下隔着窗子，千言万语嘱托张德辉照管照管。张德辉满口应承，吃过饭告辞，又回说：“十四日是上好出行日期，大世兄即刻打点行李，雇下骡子，十四日一早就长行了。”薛蟠喜之不尽，将此话告诉了薛姨妈。\n　　薛姨妈和宝钗、香菱并两个年老的嬷嬷，连日打点行装，派下薛蟠之奶公老苍头一名，当年谙事旧仆二名，外有薛蟠随身常使小厮二名：主仆一共六人。雇了三辆大车，单拉行李使物，又雇了四个长行骡子。薛蟠自骑一匹家内养的铁青大走骡，外备一匹坐马，诸事完毕，薛姨妈、宝钗等连夜劝戒之言，自不必备说。至十三日，薛蟠先去辞了他母舅，然后过来辞了贾宅诸人，贾珍等未免又有饯行之说，也不必细述。至十四日一早，薛姨妈、宝钗等直同薛蟠出了仪门，母女两个四只眼看他去了方回来。\n　　薛姨妈上京带来的家人不过四五房，并两三个老嬷嬷小丫头，今跟了薛蟠一去，外面只剩了一两个男子，因此薛姨妈即日到书房，将一应陈设玩器并帘帐等物尽行搬进来收贮，命两个跟去的男子之妻，一并也进来睡觉。又命香菱将他屋里也收拾严紧，“将门锁了，晚上和我去睡。”宝钗道：“妈妈既有这些人作伴，不如叫菱姐姐和我作伴去。我们园里又空，夜长了，我每夜做活，越多一个人，岂不越好。”薛姨妈笑道：“正是，我忘了，原该叫他和你去才是。我前日还和你哥哥说：文杏又小，到三不着两的；莺儿一个人，不够伏侍的，还要买一个丫头来你使。”宝钗道：“买的不知底里，倘或走了眼，花了钱事小，没的淘气。倒是慢慢打听着，有知道来历的，买个还罢了。”一面说，一面命香菱收拾了衾褥妆奁，命一个老嬷嬷并臻儿送至蘅芜院去，然后宝钗和香菱才同回园中来。\n　　香菱向宝钗道：“我原要和太太说的，等大爷去了，我和姑娘做伴去。我又恐怕太太多心，说我贪着园里来玩，谁知你竟说了。”宝钗笑道：“我知道你心里羡慕这园子不是一日两日的了，只是没有个空儿。每日来一趟，慌慌张张的，也没趣儿。所以趁着机会，越发住上一年，我也多个做伴的，你也遂了你的心。”香菱笑道：“好姑娘！趁着这个功夫，你教给我做诗罢！”宝钗笑道：“我说你‘得陇望蜀’呢。我劝你且缓一缓，今儿头一日进来，先出园东角门，从老太太起，各处各人，你都瞧瞧，问候一声儿，也不必特意告诉他们搬进园来。若有提起因由儿的，你只带口说我带了你进来做伴儿就完了。回来进了园，再到各姑娘房里走走。”香菱应着，才要走时，只见平儿忙忙的走来。香菱忙问了好，平儿只得陪笑相问。宝钗因向平儿笑道：“我今儿把他带了来做伴儿，正要回你奶奶一声儿。”平儿笑道：“姑娘说的是那里的话？我竟没话答言了。”宝钗道：“这才是正理。‘店房有个主人，庙里有个住持。’虽不是大事，到底告诉一声，就是园里坐更上夜的人，知道添了他两个，也好关门候户的了。你回去就告诉一声罢，我不打发人说去了。”平儿答应着，因又向香菱道：“你既来了，也不拜拜街坊去吗？”宝钗笑道：“我正叫他去呢。”平儿道：“你且不必往我们家去，二爷病了在家里呢。”香菱答应着去了，先从贾母处来，不在话下。\n　　且说平儿见香菱去了，就拉宝钗悄悄说道：“姑娘可听见我们的新文没有？”宝钗道：“我没听见新文。因连日打发我哥哥出门，所以你们这里的事，一概不知道，连姐妹们这两天没见。”平儿笑道：“老爷把二爷打的动不得，难道姑娘就没听见吗？”宝钗道：“早起恍惚听见了一句，也信不真。我也正要瞧你奶奶去呢，不想你来。又是为了什么打他？”平儿咬牙骂道：“都是那什么贾雨村，半路途中那里来的饿不死的野杂种！认了不到十年，生了多少事出来。今年春天，老爷不知在那个地方看见几把旧扇子，回家来，看家里所有收着的这些好扇子，都不中用了，立刻叫人各处搜求。谁知就有个不知死的冤家，混号儿叫做石头呆子，穷的连饭也没的吃，偏偏他家就有二十把旧扇子，死也不肯拿出大门来。二爷好容易烦了多少情，见了这个人，说之再三，他把二爷请了到他家里坐着，拿出这扇子来略瞧了一瞧。据二爷说，原是不能再得的，全是湘妃、棕竹、麋鹿、玉竹的，皆是古人写画真迹。回来告诉了老爷，便叫买他的，要多少银子给他多少。偏那石呆子说：‘我饿死冻死，一千两银子一把，我也不卖。’老爷没法了，天天骂二爷没能为。已经许他五百银子，先兑银子，后拿扇子，他只是不卖，只说：‘要扇子先要我的命！’姑娘想想，这有什么法子？谁知那雨村没天理的听见了，便设了法子，讹他拖欠官银，拿他到了衙门里去，说：‘所欠官银，变卖家产赔补。’把这扇子抄了来，做了官价，送了来。那石呆子如今不知是死是活。老爷问着二爷说：‘人家怎么弄了来了？’二爷只说了一句：”为这点子小事弄的人家倾家败产，也不算什么能为。’老爷听了就生了气，说二爷拿话堵老爷呢。这是第一件大的。过了几日，还有几件小的，我也记不清，所以都凑在一处，就打起来了。也没拉倒用板子棍子，就站着，不知他拿什么东西打了一顿，脸上打破了两处。我们听见姨太太这里有一种药上棒疮的，姑娘寻一丸给我呢。”宝钗听了，忙命莺儿去找了两丸来与平儿。宝钗道：“既这样，你去替我问候罢，我就不去了。”平儿向宝钗答应着去了，不在话下。\n　　且说香菱见了众人之后，吃过晚饭，宝钗等都往贾母处去了，自己便往潇湘馆中来。此时黛玉已好了大半了，见香菱也进园来住，自是喜欢。香菱因笑道：“我这一进来了，也得空儿，好歹教给我做诗，就是我的造化了。”黛玉笑道：“既要学做诗，你就拜我为师。我虽不通，大略也还教的起你。”香菱笑道：“果然这样，我就拜你为师，你可不许腻烦的。”黛玉道：“什么难事，也值得去学？不过是起、承、转、合，当中承、转是两副对子，平声的对仄声，虚的对实的，实的对虚的。若是果有了奇句，连平仄虚实不对都使得的。”香菱笑道：“怪道我常弄本旧诗，偷空儿看一两首，又有对的极工的，又有不对的。又听见说，‘一三五不论，二四六分明。’看古人的诗上，亦有顺的，亦有二四六上错了的。所以天天疑惑。如今听你一说，原来这些规矩，竟是没事的，只要词句新奇为上。”黛玉道：“正是这个道理。词句究竟还是末事，第一是立意要紧。若意趣真了，连词句不用修饰自是好的，这叫做‘不为词害意’。”香菱道：“我只爱陆放翁的‘重帘不卷留香久，古砚微凹聚墨多’，说的真切有趣。”黛玉道：“断不可看这样的诗。你们因不知诗，所以见了这浅近的就爱，一入了这个格局，再学不出来的。你只听我说，你若真心要学，我这里有《王摩诘全集》，你且把他的五言律一百首细心揣摩透熟了，然后再读一百二十首老杜的七言律，次之再李青莲的七言绝句读一二百首。肚子里先有了这三个人做了底子，然后再把陶渊明、应、刘、谢、阮、庾、鲍等人的一看，你又是这样一个极聪明伶俐的人，不用一年工夫，不愁不是诗翁了。”香菱听了，笑道：“既这样，好姑娘，你就把这书给我拿出来，我带回去夜里念几首也是好的。”黛玉听说，便命紫鹃将王右丞的五言律拿来，递与香菱道：“你只看有红圈的，都是我选的，有一首念一首。不明白的问你姑娘，或者遇见我，我讲与你就是了。”香菱拿了诗，回至蘅芜院中，诸事不管，只向灯下一首一首的读起来。宝钗连催他数次睡觉，他也不睡。宝钗见他这般苦心，只得随地去了。\n　　一日，黛玉方梳洗完了，只见香菱笑吟吟的送了书来，又要换杜律。黛玉笑道：“共记得多少首？”香菱笑道：“凡红圈选的，我尽读了。”黛玉道：“可领略了些没有？”香菱笑道：“我倒领略了些，只不知是不是，说给你听听。”黛玉笑道：“正要讲究讨论，方能长进。你且说来我听听。”香菱笑道：“据我看来，诗的好处，有口里说不出来的意思，想去却是逼真的；又似乎无理的，想去竟是有理有情的。”黛玉笑道：“这话有了些意思！但不知你从何处见得？”香菱笑道：“我看《塞上》一首，内一联云：‘大漠孤烟直，长河落日圆。’想来烟如何直？日自然是圆的。这‘直’字似无理，‘圆’字似太俗。合上书一想，倒象是见了这景的。要说再找两个字换这两个，竟再找不出两个字来。再还有：‘日落江湖白，潮来天地青。’这‘白’‘青’两个字，也似无理，想来必得这两个字才形容的尽，念在嘴里，倒象有几千斤重的一个橄榄似的。还有‘渡头馀落日，墟里上孤烟’，这‘馀’字合‘上’字，难为他怎么想来！我们那年上京来，那日下晚便挽住船，岸上又没有人，只有几棵树。远远的几家人家作晚饭，那个烟竟是青碧连云。谁知我昨儿晚上看了这两句，倒象我又到了那个地方去了。”\n　　正说着，宝玉和探春来了，都入座听他讲诗。宝玉笑道：“既是这样，也不用看诗，‘会心处不在远’，听你说了这两句，可知三昧你已得了。”黛玉笑道：“你说他这‘上孤烟’好，你还不知他这一句还是套了前人的来。我给你这一句瞧瞧，更比这个淡而现成。”说着，便把陶渊明的“暧暧远人村，依依墟里烟”翻了出来，递给香菱。香菱瞧了，点头叹赏，笑道：“原来‘上’字从‘依依’两个字上化出来的。”宝玉大笑道：“你已得了。不用再讲，要再讲，倒学离了。你就做起来了，必是好的。”探春笑道：“明儿我补一个柬来，请你入社。”香菱道：“姑娘何苦打趣我！我不过是心里羡慕，才学这个玩罢了。”探春黛玉都笑道：“谁不是玩？难道我们是认真做诗呢。要说我们真成了诗，出了这园子，把人的牙还笑掉了呢。”宝玉道：“这也算自暴自弃了。前儿我在外头和相公们商画儿，他们听见咱们起诗社，求我把稿子给他们瞧瞧，我就写了几首给他们看看。谁不是真心叹服？他们抄了刻去了。”探春、黛玉忙问道：“这是真话么？“宝玉笑退：“说谎的是那架上鹦哥。”黛玉、探春听说，都道：“你真真胡闹！且别说那不成诗，便成诗，我们的笔墨，也不该传到外头去。”宝玉道：“这怕什么？古来闺阁中笔墨不要传出去，如今也没人知道呢。”说着，只见惜春打发了入画来请宝玉，宝玉方去了。\n　　香菱又逼着换出杜律，又央黛玉、探春二人：“出个题目让我诌去，诌了来替我改正。”黛玉道：“昨夜的月最好，我正要诌一首未诌成。你就做一首来。‘十四寒’的韵，由你爱用那几个字去。”香菱听了，喜的拿着诗回来，又苦思一回，做两句诗：又舍不得杜诗，又读两首：如此茶饭无心，坐卧不定。宝钗道：“何苦自寻烦恼？都是颦儿引的你，我和他算账去！你本来呆头呆脑的，再添上这个，越发弄成个呆子了。”香菱笑道：“好姑娘，别混我。”一面说，一面做了一首。先给宝钗看了，笑道：“这个不好，不是这个做法。你别害臊，只管拿了给他瞧去，看是他怎么说。”香菱听了，便拿了诗找黛玉。黛玉看时，只见写道是：\n　　月桂中天夜色寒，清光皎皎影团团。\n　　诗人助兴常思玩，野客添愁不忍观。\n　　弱翠楼边悬玉镜，珍珠帘外挂冰盘。\n　　良宵何用烧银烛，晴彩辉煌映画栏。\n　　黛玉笑道：“意思却有，只是措词不雅。皆因你看的诗少，被他缚住了。把这首诗丢开，再做一首。只管放开胆子去做。”\n　　香菱听了，默默的回来，越发连房也不进去，只在池边树下。或坐在山石上出神，或蹲在地下抠地，来往的人都诧异。李纨、宝钗、探春、宝玉等听得此言，都远远的站在山坡上瞧着他笑。只见他皱一回眉，又自己含笑一回。宝钗笑道：“这个人定是疯了。昨夜嘟嘟哝哝，直闹到五更才睡下。没一顿饭的工夫，天就亮了，我就听见他起来了，忙忙碌碌梳了头，就找颦儿去。一回来，呆了一天，做了一首又不好，自然这会子另做呢。”宝玉笑道：“这正是‘地灵人杰’，老天生人，再不虚赋情性的。我们成日叹说：可惜他这么个人，竟俗了。谁知到底有今日！可见天地至公。”宝钗听了，笑道：“你能够象他这苦心就好了，学什么有个不成的吗？”宝玉不答。\n　　只见香菱兴兴头头的，又往黛玉那边来了。探春笑道：“咱们跟了去，看他有些意思没有。”说着，一齐都往潇湘馆来。只见黛玉正拿着诗和他讲究呢。众人因问黛玉：“做的如何？”黛玉道：“自然算难为他了，只是还不好。这一首过于穿凿了，还得另做。”众人因要诗看时，只见做道是：\n　　非银非水映窗寒，试看睛空护玉盘。\n　　淡淡梅龙香欲柒，丝丝柳带露初干。\n　　只疑残粉涂金砌，恍若轻霜抹玉栏。\n　　梦醒西楼人迹绝，馀容犹可隔帘看。\n　　宝钗笑道：“不象吟月了，月字底下添一个‘色’字，倒还使得。你看句句倒象是月色。也罢了，原是‘诗从胡说来’，再迟几天就好了。”香菱自为这首诗妙绝，听如此说，自己又扫了兴，不肯丢开手，便要思索起来。因见他姐妹们说笑，便自己走至阶下竹前，挖心搜胆的，耳不旁听，目不别视。一时探春隔窗笑说道：“菱姑娘，你闲闲罢。”香菱怔怔答道：“‘闲’字是‘十五删’的，错了韵了。”众人听了，不觉大笑起来．宝钗道：“可真诗魔了，都是颦儿引的他！”黛玉笑道：“圣人说：‘诲人不倦。’他又来问我，我岂有不说的理。”李纨笑道：“咱们拉了他往四姑娘屋里去，引他瞧瞧画儿，叫他醒一醒才好。”说着，真个出来拉他过藕香榭，至暖香坞中。惜春正乏倦，在床上歪着睡午觉，画缯立在壁间，用纱罩着。众人唤醒了惜春，揭纱看时，十停方有了三停。见画上有几个美人，因指香菱道：“凡会做诗的，都画在上头，你快学罢。”说着，玩笑了一回，各自散去。\n　　香菱满心中正是想诗，至晚间，对灯出了一回神，至三更以后，上床躺下，两眼睁睁直到五更，方才朦胧着了。一时天亮，宝钗醒了。听了一听，他安稳睡了，心下想：“他翻腾了一夜，不知可做成了？这会子乏了，且别叫他。”正想着，只见香菱从梦中笑道：“可是有了，难道这一首还不好吗？”宝钗听了，又是可叹，又是可笑，连忙叫醒了他，问他：“得了什么？你这诚心都通了仙了。学不成诗，弄出病来呢！”一面说，一面梳洗了，和姐妹往贾母处来。\n　　原来香菱苦志学诗，精血诚聚，日间不能做出，忽于梦中得了八句。梳洗已毕，便忙写出，来到沁芳亭。只见李纨与众姐妹方从王夫人处回来，宝钗正告诉他们，说他梦中做诗说梦话，众人正笑。抬头见他来了，就都争着要诗看。\n要知端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "After hearing this, Xue Pan gradually calmed down. In four or five days, though the pain had subsided, the scars were still visible. He stayed at home feigning illness, too ashamed to see any relatives or friends.\n\nSoon it was the tenth month. As some of the assistants in their shops had to go home to make up their annual accounts, the Xues had to give a farewell feast for them. One of these, Zhang Dehui, who had worked since boyhood as chief assistant in their pawnshop, had now saved two or three thousand taels. He was going home too but would be back the following spring. He mentioned:\n\n“This year there’s a shortage of paper, scent and spices, so next year they’re bound to be dear. I’ll send my eldest son here before then to look after the pawnshop, and on my way back after Dragon-Boat Festival I’ll bring a load of paper, scent and fans to sell. Even after paying duty and other expenses, I should make a few hundred per cent profit.”\n\nThis set Xue Pan thinking, “I’m still in disgrace after that thrashing I had, and I’d like to hide myself away for a year. But there’s nowhere I can go. It’s no solution to keep on pretending to be ill every day. Besides, though I’m a grown man now, I’m useless at civil and military arts. And though I’m in trade, I’ve never learned to use the abacus or steelyard, and I don’t know the price of land or local customs or the distance to different places. Why not raise some capital and go with Zhang Dehui for a year? Whether I make money or not, at least I can lie low for a time. And it would be fun to see some new scenery.”\n\nHis mind made up, after the feast he took Zhang Dehui aside and proposed this, asking him to wait a couple of days so that they could travel together. That evening he told his mother.\n\nAunt Xue, though pleased, was afraid that away from home he might get into trouble and lose his capital. So she would not hear of it.\n\n“I’d feel easier in my mind if you stayed with me,” she said. “We can do without this business. We don’t need the few hundred taels you might make.”\n\nBut Xue Pan had set his heart on going and would not listen.\n\n“You’re always complaining that I don’t know how to cope and can’t do this or that,” he objected. “Now that I’ve made up my mind to cut off all useless connections and learn how to do business properly, you won’t let me. What am I supposed to do? I’m not a girl, to be kept shut indoors all the time. How long is this going on? Besides, Zhang Dehui is an old man and our families have always been on good terms. How could I go wrong with him? Even if I did something not quite right, he’d be sure to reason with me. And he knows all about current prices and market trends; I’d consult him on everything. So it’s bound to work out well. If you won’t let me go, in a couple of days I’ll slip away without telling you and come back next year rolling in money. Then you’ll see!”\n\nWith that he went off to bed in a huff.\n\nAunt Xue discussed this with Baochai.\n\n“If brother really means to do some proper work, well and good,” said Baochai with a smile. “But though he talks so big at home, once he’s away he may start his bad old ways again and be quite uncontrollable. Still, there’s no point in worrying too much. If he really turns over a new leaf, that will be a blessing for the rest of his life. If not, there’s nothing you can do about it, mother. You must do your best for him and then leave the rest to Heaven. He’s a grown man. If you keep him at home for fear he doesn’t know the ways of the world and can’t manage business, he’ll never change. Since he’s made such a point of it, why not let him try, mother, and write off eight hundred or a thousand taels as spent on his education? After all, the assistants there are bound to help him — they can hardly cheat him. And once away, with no boon companions or backers, he’ll find that abroad nobody is afraid of him. If he has money he can eat; if not, he’ll have to go hungry. With no one to turn to, he may behave better away from home than he does here.”\n\nAfter thinking it over Aunt Xue said, “Very well, I’ll do as you say.”\n\nAfter talking it over, they parted for the night. The next day Aunt Xue sent for Zhang Dehui and received him in the library, having Xue Pan entertain him to a meal while she herself, from the back verandah through the window, urged the old man time and again to keep an eye on her son. He assented readily.\n\nAfter the meal, when taking his leave, he said, “The fourteenth is a good day for travelling. If the young master will get his luggage ready and hire mules, we can make an early start that morning.”\n\nXue Pan, overjoyed, passed this on to his mother.\n\nAunt Xue, Baochai and Xiangling, with two old nurses, spent the next few days packing. They assigned Xue Pan one old steward who had been his nurse’s husband, two experienced older servants and two page-boys who usually waited on him; so his retinue numbered six. They hired three large carts for the baggage, and four long-distance mules. Xue Pan would ride a big black mule from their own stable, and they had another horse saddled as a spare. When all was ready, Aunt Xue and Baochai gave Xue Pan advice and warnings which we need not repeat.\n\nOn the thirteenth he went to take leave of his uncle, then came to say goodbye to all the Jias. Jia Zhen and the rest naturally had farewell feasts for him, which again need not be described in detail.\n\nOn the fourteenth, Aunt Xue and Baochai saw him out through the inner gate and did not turn back until he was out of sight.\n\nAunt Xue had only four or five families of servants with her in the capital, in addition to two or three old nurses and young maids. Now that Xue Pan had left with some of them, there were only one or two men left in the outer household. So that same day she had the library cleared of all curios, furnishings, portieres and hangings, which were stored away inside. She ordered the wives of the two menservants who had accompanied her son to move into the inner apartments to sleep, and told Xiangling to lock up her room.\n\n“You can come and sleep with me,” she said.\n\n“Since you have so many people to keep you company, mother,” put in Baochai, “wouldn’t it be better to let Sister Xiangling stay with me? It’s lonely in the Garden, the nights are long and I sit up sewing. Another person would make it much more cheerful.”\n\n“Of course,” agreed her mother. “I forgot. I should have sent her to keep you company. I was only saying the other day to your brother that Wenxing’s too young and undependable, and Yinger’s not enough to look after you by herself. We must buy another maid for you.”\n\n“If we buy one we don’t know her background. If we made a poor choice, the money would be wasted and we might land ourselves with trouble. Better wait till we hear of someone with good references.”\n\nAs she spoke she told Xiangling to pack her bedding and toilet-case, and sent an old nurse with Zhe’er to take these to Alpinia Park. Then she went back to the Garden with Xiangling.\n\n“I meant to ask the mistress, after the young master’s departure, to let me stay with you, miss,” said Xiangling. “But I was afraid she might think I was just out for a good time in the Garden. I didn’t expect you to suggest it.”\n\nBaochai smiled.\n\n“I know you’ve been hankering after this Garden for a long time, but there was no excuse for you to move in. You had no fun, coming here for a short while each day in such a rush. So I’ve seized this chance to have you here for a year, to keep me company and let you enjoy yourself to your heart’s content.”\n\n“Dear miss, this is my chance!” cried Xiangling. “Will you teach me to write poetry?”\n\n“So the more one gets the more one wants!” laughed Baochai. “I advise you to take it easy. You’ve just moved in today. First go out through the east corner gate of the Garden and pay your respects to the old lady and all the ladies, to show you know the rules. But don’t say you’ve moved into the Garden. If anyone asks, you can just mention that I brought you to keep me company. When you come back, you can call on the girls in the Garden.”\n\nXiangling was assenting and about to leave when Pinger hurried in. Xiangling greeted her, and Pinger had to stop to chat with her.\n\n“I’ve brought her here to keep me company and meant to let your mistress know,” said Baochai.\n\n“What a thing to say, miss!” protested Pinger. “You make me feel quite uncomfortable.”\n\n“That’s only right. ‘The inn has its landlord, the temple its abbot.’ Although this isn’t important, I ought to have told her, so that the watchmen in the Garden know that two more people are here and can lock up in good time. When you go back, let her know. I won’t send anyone else.”\n\nPinger assented and then asked Xiangling, “Now that you’re here, why not call on your neighbours?”\n\n“I was just going to ask her to,” said Baochai.\n\n“But don’t go to our place,” Pinger warned. “The master’s laid up at home.”\n\nXiangling assented and went off first to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. But no more of this.\n\nPinger, left alone with Baochai, drew her aside and asked, “Have you heard our news, miss?”\n\n“No. I’ve been busy these last few days getting my brother off, so I know nothing about your affairs. I haven’t seen the other girls for the last couple of days either.”\n\n“The master beat the Second Master so badly, he can’t move. Do you mean to say you didn’t know?”\n\n“I did hear a vague report this morning, but I didn’t believe it. I was thinking of calling on your mistress, but now you’re here. What did he beat him for?”\n\n“It’s all because of that swine Jia Yucun or whatever his name is — that half-baked, starveling mongrel who turned up out of the blue! Since we acknowledged him as kin less than ten years ago, he’s stirred up no end of trouble. Well, this spring the master saw goodness knows where some old fans, and when he came home and looked at all the good ones we have he felt none of them were good enough. So he sent people out at once to search for more. Who’d have thought that a man known as the Dunce of Stone — a crazy pauper who hadn’t a grain of rice to his name but owned twenty old fans — would refuse at any price to sell them? The Second Master had to pull innumerable strings to get to see the fellow. He begged and begged, and finally was invited to his house to sit down and have a look at the fans. According to the Second Master, they were superb, priceless — made of speckled bamboo, brown bamboo, and different sorts of jade-like bamboo, with inscriptions and paintings by ancient masters.\n\n“When he told the master this, the master wanted to buy them and was willing to pay any price. But the Dunce of Stone said, ‘I’d rather starve or freeze to death than sell them, not even for two thousand tacls apiece.’\n\n“The master had no way to get them, and every day he swore at the Second Master for incompetence. He offered five hundred tacls for the fans, cash down, but the Dunce still wouldn’t sell. He said, ‘Kill me first, then take my fans!’\n\n“What could we do, miss? Then that unprincipled wretch Jia Yucun heard of this and hatched a plot. He had the man arrested and taken to his yamen on a charge of owing the government taxes. ‘Confiscate his property to make it up,’ he ordered. So those fans were seized and paid for at the price fixed by the yamen. As for the Dunce of Stone, no one knows whether he’s dead or alive.\n\n“When the master asked the Second Master, ‘How did he get them?’ the Second Master just commented, ‘It’s no great feat to ruin a family for the sake of a few fans.’ That made the master angry. He accused the Second Master of ‘answering back.’ That was the chief cause. There were a few other smaller matters too which I can’t remember, but they all added to his anger and that’s why he gave him such a beating, not just with the rod but with a board too....”\n\n\"My young mistress was standing there when for no reason at all he beat her. He cut her face in two places. We heard that you have some special medicine, madam, for wounds caused by beating. Will you give me a pill?\"\n\nBaochai at once ordered Yinger to fetch two pills. \"Please give her my compliments,\" she said. \"I won't go over.\"\n\nPinger assented and left.\n\nAfter Xiangling had called on the others and they had finished dinner, Baochai and the rest went to see the Lady Dowager, but she herself went to Bamboo Lodge. Daiyu was now much better and was delighted to hear that Xiangling had come to live in the Garden too.\n\n\"Now that I've moved in here and have time to spare,\" said Xiangling, \"I hope you'll be good enough to teach me to write poetry. That would be wonderful.\"\n\n\"If you want to learn,\" replied Daiyu smiling, \"you must pay homage to me as your tutor. Though I'm not much of a poet myself, I dare say I can teach you.\"\n\n\"If so, let me pay homage to you now as my tutor. You mustn't find me a nuisance.\"\n\n\"There's nothing so hard about writing poetry. The first line is opening, the second is developing, the third is transition, and the fourth is concluding. In the middle two lines the one should contrast with the other. Flat tones should contrast with oblique ones, and empty words with solid. If there's a good line, it doesn't matter if the other rules aren't followed too strictly.\"\n\n\"No wonder when I look at a few old poems sometimes in my spare time, some have parallel couplets and some don't; and I've heard it said that the first, third and fifth words don't matter, only the second, fourth and sixth must be strictly regular. But I find that in old poems, sometimes the second, fourth and sixth are wrong too. So that's puzzled me. Now I understand that rules don't matter so much, the main thing is to have fresh ideas.\"\n\n\"Quite right. The wording is of secondary importance, the ideas are what count. If the ideas are original, the wording doesn't have to be polished — that's what is meant by 'not letting the words harm the meaning.'\"\n\n\"I like Lu Fangweng's line:\n\n'In double curtaining the scent lingers;\n\nThe old inkstone, slightly concave, pools ink.'\n\nThat's so true to life and charming.\"\n\n\"You mustn't read such shallow, facile verse just because you don't know much about poetry. If you get into that way of writing, you'll never get out of it. Take my advice. If you really want to learn, here's a copy of the complete works of Wang Wei. First study a hundred of his pentasyllabic regulated verses. Read them carefully and digest them. Then read a hundred and twenty of Du Fu's heptasyllabic regulated verses, and after that Li Bai's two hundred heptasyllabic quatrains. When you've learnt these three poets by heart as a foundation, and then read Tao Qian, Ying Qu, Liu Zhen, Xie Lingyun, Ruan Ji, Yu Xin and Bao Zhao, you'll be a good poet in less than a year — with your intelligence.\"\n\n\"In that case, miss, do lend me that book to take back. I'll read it this evening.\"\n\nDaiyu told Zijuan to fetch Wang Youcheng's collection of pentasyllabic regulated verses and handed it to Xiangling.\n\n\"Just read all the ones I've marked with red circles,\" she said. \"Read every one of them. If you don't understand anything, ask your mistress; or if I'm free, you can ask me.\"\n\nXiangling took the poems back to Alpinia Park and, ignoring everything else, read them line by line under the lamp. Baochai urged her several times to go to bed, but she took no notice. Seeing how obsessed she was, Baochai had to let her be.\n\nOne day, just after Daiyu had finished her toilet, Xiangling came back smiling happily with the book to exchange it for Du Fu's regulated verses.\n\n\"How many have you learned by heart?\" Daiyu asked.\n\n\"All the ones you marked.\"\n\nDaiyu asked, “Have you learned anything from it?”\n\n“I think I have,” said Xiangling with a smile. “But I may be quite wrong. I’ll tell you, and you can tell me what you think.”\n\n“That’s the way to learn — by comparing notes. Go on.”\n\n“It seems to me that poetry’s charm lies in something one can’t quite put into words, yet it gives a very vivid picture. A line which sounds irrational may, on second thoughts, prove to have deep feeling in it.”\n\n“That’s not at all bad. What gave you this idea?”\n\n“I was reading that poem about the frontier, and there’s a couplet:\n\nIn boundless desert lonely smokes rise straight;\n\nOver endless river the sun sinks round.\n\n“Now how can the smoke be straight? The sun is naturally round. The word ‘straight’ seems irrational, ‘round’ rather commonplace. But closing the book I felt as if I’d seen that scene. As for finding two other words to replace these, I couldn’t find any to equal them. Then there’s another couplet:\n\nAs the sun sets, rivers and lakes gleam white;\n\nThe tide flowing in, the sky and earth look blue.\n\n“The words ‘white’ and ‘blue’ seem irrational too; yet one feels these are the only words to use. The lines leave a taste in the mouth like an olive weighing thousands of catties. And then:\n\nThe setting sun bathes the ferry in its light;\n\nOver the lonely village smoke slowly rises.\n\n“How did he hit on the words ‘bathes’ and ‘slowly rises’? When we came to the capital that year, one evening we moored the boat in a deserted place with just a few trees, and in the distance we could see some households cooking supper. The smoke was a bluish green, coiling up to the clouds. Last night, when I read these two lines, it was as if I’d gone back to that place again.”\n\nJust then Baoyu and Tanchun joined them and sat down to listen.\n\n“If that’s how you feel, there’s no need to read any more poems,” cried Baoyu. “As the saying goes, ‘The mind’s understanding need not be far sought.’ From what you’ve just said, I can see you’ve got the essence of poetry.”\n\n“You praise the line ‘Over the lonely village smoke slowly rises’,” put in Daiyu. “But don’t you know it’s plagiarized from an earlier poet? Let me show you a more simple and natural version.”\n\nShe found and showed Xiangling the lines by Tao Qian:\n\nA faint light shines from the far village;\n\nThe smoke from the hamlet drifts away.\n\nXiangling read them and nodded her appreciation. “So ‘slowly rises’ comes from ‘drifts away’!” she exclaimed.\n\nBaoyu laughed. “Now you’ve got it. There’s no need to say any more. If you do, you’ll be wide of the mark. You can start writing poems now — I’m sure they’ll be good.”\n\nTanchun told Xiangling, “Tomorrow I’ll send you an invitation to join our club.”\n\n“Why are you making fun of me, miss?” protested Xiangling. “I’m only learning this for fun because I admire your poetry.”\n\n“Who isn’t doing it for fun?” retorted Tanchun and Daiyu, laughing. “Are we really studying to be poets? If we were to take ourselves seriously and our poems were shown outside, people would laugh their teeth out.”\n\n“That’s underestimating yourself,” objected Baoyu. “The other day when I was outside showing some of my paintings to some gentlemen and they heard that we’d started a poetry club, they begged me to let them see some of our poems. So I copied out a few for them, and they were full of genuine admiration. They had them copied out and printed.”\n\n“Really?” cried Tanchun and Daiyu in dismay.\n\n“If I’m lying, may I turn into that parrot on the perch!”\n\n“How outrageous!” they exclaimed. “Even if our verses were any good, they shouldn’t be shown outside.”\n\n“What does it matter?” he countered. “There’s no reason why girls’ writings shouldn’t be known outside. People don’t know about them, that’s all.”\n\nJust then, Xichun sent a maid to fetch Baoyu and he had to go.\n\nXiangling, however, importuned Daiyu and Tanchun to set her subjects....\n\n\"I’ll think up a subject and make up a poem, then you can correct it for me.”\n\n“Last night the moon was so lovely,” said Daiyu. “I was meaning to write a poem about it but never got round to it. So you write one on the moon, using the rhymes you like best from the ‘fourteenth cold’ rhyme sequence.”\n\nXiangling, overjoyed, went back with the rhyme-book. After some hard thinking she composed a couplet; but then, too fond of Du Fu’s poetry to put it down, she read two more of his poems. She had no heart for tea or food and sat there rapt, unable to sleep or rest.\n\n“Why ask for trouble?” asked Baochai. “It’s all on account of that Frowner that you’re in this state. I’ve a good mind to go and settle scores with her. You were already addled enough, and now you’ve made yourself more so.”\n\n“Don’t tease me, miss,” begged Xiangling with a smile. And she went on to compose a poem which she first showed Baochai.\n\n“This is no good,” said Baochai. “It’s not the way to write on the moon. Don’t be shy, though. Take it to her and see what she says.”\n\nXiangling accordingly took her poem to Daiyu, who read:\n\nThe moon hangs cold in the sky above the court,\n\nIts clear light gleaming on the scene around.\n\nOften the poet seeks to be comforted by it,\n\nBut wayfarers are loath to see it frown.\n\nOn the tower by the bamboos it hangs like a bright mirror,\n\nBeyond the pearly blind like a jade plate it shines.\n\nNeed we light silver candles on this fine night?\n\nIts splendour illumines the painted balustrade.\n\n“Not bad,” said Daiyu. “But the diction is rather clumsy, because you’ve read too few poems and are too much under their influence. Put this one aside and write another. Just let yourself go.”\n\nXiangling silently withdrew and, instead of going back to her room, wandered by the pool or under the trees, or sat on a rock rapt in thought, or squatted down to trace characters on the ground, to the astonishment of all who passed. Li Wan, Baochai, Tanchun and Baoyu, hearing of this, climbed the slope to watch her from a distance and have a quiet laugh. They saw her knitting her brows one minute and smiling the next.\n\n“The girl’s really possessed,” said Baochai. “She was muttering away until nearly dawn before she went to sleep, and less time than it takes for a meal later it was light and I heard her get up and bustle about dressing, then rush off to find Frowner. She came back dazed and spent the whole day on a poem which was no good. I suppose she’s working on another now.”\n\n“This is what is meant by ‘a fine place breeds fine people’,” said Baoyu. “Little did we know that she’d be inspired by the genius of this place. Next time we mustn’t say it’s a pity such a charming person should be so vulgar. It seems Heaven is fair after all.”\n\n“If you’d only work as hard as she does at whatever you’re learning, you’d master it,” teased Baochai.\n\nBaoyu made no reply.\n\nJust then they saw Xiangling walk off cheerfully to find Daiyu again.\n\n“Let’s follow her and see if there’s anything in it,” proposed Tanchun.\n\nSo they went together to Bamboo Lodge. Daiyu was discussing the poem with Xiangling when the others arrived and asked how it was getting on.\n\n“It can’t have been easy for her,” said Daiyu. “But it’s still not good. This one is too far-fetched.”\n\nThe others asked to see it. This is what she had written:\n\nNot silver but water outside the chilled window shines,\n\nGazing at the clear sky I see the jade plate too.\n\nFragrance of mumes seems dyed by the snow melting,\n\nAnd willows look spangled with dewdrops just dried.\n\nI wonder if the powder is spread on the golden steps,\n\nOr seems to lighten the jade balustrade with light frost.\n\nHaving woken from a dream in the western chamber\n\nI find the moon’s beauty can still be viewed through the blind.\n\n“This doesn’t read like a poem on the moon,” commented Baochai. “If you put the word ‘colour’ after ‘moon’ in each line, it would seem more to the point. In fact, it reads rather like a poem on the moon’s colour. Well, versifying is nothing but nonsense anyway. After a few days you’ll do better.”\n\nXiangling, who had thought this poem excellent, was rather dashed by such criticism. But instead of giving up she went on thinking.\n\nWhile the others were laughing and chatting, Xiangling walked off to stand in front of the bamboos below the steps, straining her mind for inspiration, deaf and blind to all else. Presently Tanchun called to her through the window:\n\n“Have a rest, Miss Ling!”\n\nXiangling assented absently, “Yes. ‘Rest’ belongs to the fifteenth rhyme, so that’s wrong.”\n\nThis set all the girls laughing.\n\n“She’s really bewitched,” cried Baochai. “It’s all on account of Frowner.”\n\nDaiyu smiled. “The sage said, ‘I am never tired of teaching others.’ When she asks me, how can I refuse?”\n\n“Let’s take her to the fourth sister’s room to have a look at her painting and wake her up,” proposed Li Wan.\n\nShe suited the action to the word and led Xiangling across Lotus Fragrance Anchorage to Warm Scent Arbour. Xichun, tired out, was reclining on her bed having a nap. The painting was on the wall, covered with gauze. They woke her up and uncovered the painting, one-third of which was now done. It showed several beautiful girls.\n\nPointing to them Li Wan told Xiangling, “All the girls who can write poetry are here. You’d better learn quickly.”\n\nThey chatted for a while then dispersed.\n\nXiangling was still obsessed with poetry. That evening she stared abstractedly at her lamp, and not until after the third watch did she go to bed. But she lay awake with wide-open eyes until the fifth watch, when at last she dozed off. Presently day broke and Baochai woke up. Hearing that Xiangling was sleeping quietly she thought, “She was tossing all night. I wonder if she’s finished her poem? She must be tired out now, so I won’t disturb her.”\n\nJust then Xiangling laughed in her sleep and cried, “I’ve got it! This one should be good, shouldn’t it?”\n\nBaochai, half amused and half sighing, had to wake her up.\n\n“What have you got?” she asked. “Your single-minded devotion has inspired the spirits. But you may fall ill if you don’t master the art of poetry.”\n\nShe made haste to wash and dress, then went with the other girls to the Lady Dowager’s apartment.\n\nThe fact was that Xiangling had been so determined to write a good poem that, unable to manage it by day, she had finally produced eight lines in her dream. As soon as she had washed and done her hair she wrote them out and went to Seeping Fragrance Pavilion. There she found Li Wan and all the rest, who had just come back from Lady Wang’s apartments. Baochai was telling them how Xiangling had dreamed that she was composing a poem and talking in her sleep, and they were laughing at this. When they saw her approaching they lost no time in asking to see her poem.\n\nTo know what it was like, read the next chapter."
