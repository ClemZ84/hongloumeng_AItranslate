  "original": "话说彼时有人回，工程上等着糊东西的纱绫，请凤姐去开库。又有人来回，请凤姐收金银器皿。王夫人并上房丫鬟等皆不得空儿。宝钗因说道：“咱们别在这里碍手碍脚。”说着，和宝玉等便往迎春房中来。\n　　王夫人日日忙乱，直到十月里才全备了：监办的都交清账目；各处古董文玩，俱已陈设齐备；采办鸟雀，自仙鹤、鹿、兔以及鸡、鹅等，亦已买全，交于园中各处饲养；贾蔷那边也演出二三十出杂戏来：一班小尼姑、道姑也都学会念佛诵经。于是贾政略觉心中安顿。遂请贾母到园中，色色斟酌，点缀妥当，再无些微不合之处，贾政才敢题本。本上之日，奉旨：“于明年正月十五日上元之日贵妃省亲”贾府奉了此旨，一发日夜不闲，连年也不能好生过了。\n　　转眼元宵在迩。自正月初八，就有太监出来先看方向，何处更衣，何处燕坐，何处受礼，何处开宴，何处退息。又有巡察地方总理关防太监，带了许多小太监来各处关防，挡围幕，指示贾宅人员何处出入，何处进膳，何处启事种种仪注。外面又有工部官员并五城兵马司打扫街道，撵逐闲人。贾赦等监督匠人扎花灯烟火之类，至十四日，俱已停妥。这一夜，上下通不曾睡。\n　　至十五日五鼓，自贾母等有爵者，俱各按品大妆。此时园内帐舞蟠龙，帘飞绣凤，金银焕彩，珠宝生辉，鼎焚百合之香，瓶插长春之蕊，静悄悄无一人咳嗽。贾赦等在西街门外，贾母等在荣府大门外。街头巷口，用围幕挡严。正等的不耐烦，忽见一个太监骑着匹马来了，贾政接着，问其消息。太监道：“早多着呢！未初用晚膳，末正还到宝灵宫拜佛，酉初进大明宫领宴看灯方请旨。只怕戌初才起身呢。”凤姐听了道：“既这样，老太太和太太且请回房，等到了时候再来也还不迟。”于是贾母等自便去了。园中俱赖凤姐照料。执事人等，带领太监们去吃酒饭，一面传人挑进蜡烛，各处点起灯来。\n　　忽听外面马跑之声不一，有十来个太监，喘吁吁跑来拍手儿。这些太监都会意，知道是来了，各按方向站立。贾赦领合族子弟在西街门外，贾母领合族女眷在大门外迎接，半日静悄悄的。忽见两个太监骑马缓缓而来，至西街门下了马，将马赶出围幕之外，便面西站立；半日又是一对，亦是如此。少时便来了十来对，方闻隐隐鼓乐之声。一对对凤龙旌，稚雉羽宫扇，又有销金提炉，焚着御香，然后一把曲柄七凤金黄伞过来，便是冠袍带履，又有执事太监捧着香巾、绣帕、漱盂、拂尘等物。一队队过完，后面方是八个太监抬着一顶金顶鹅黄绣凤銮舆，缓缓行来。贾母等连忙跪下。早有太监过来，扶起贾母等来，将那銮舆抬入大门往东一所院落门前，有太监跪请下舆更衣。于是入门，太监散去，只有昭容、彩嫔等引着元春下舆。只见苑内各色花灯闪灼，皆系纱绫扎成，精致非常。上面有一灯匾，写着“体仁沐德”四个字。元春入室更衣，复出上舆进园。只见园中香烟缭绕，花影缤纷，处处灯光相映，时时细乐声喧，说不尽这太平景象，富贵风流。\n　　却说贾妃在轿内看了此园内外光景，因点头叹道：“太奢华过费了！”忽又见太监跪请登舟。贾妃下舆登舟，只见清流一带，势若游龙，两边石栏上，皆系水晶玻璃各色风灯，点的如银光雪浪；上面柳杏诸树，虽无花叶，却用各色绸绫纸绢及通草为花，粘于枝上，每一株悬灯万盏；更兼池中荷荇凫鹭诸灯，亦皆系螺蚌羽毛做就的，上下争辉，水天焕彩，真是玻璃世界，珠宝乾坤。船上又有各种盆景，珠帘绣幕，桂揖兰桡，自不必说了。\n　　已而入一石港，港上一面匾灯，明现着“蓼汀花溆”四字。看官听说：这“蓼汀花溆”及“有凤来仪”等字，皆系上回贾政偶试宝玉之才，何至便认真用了？想贾府世代诗书，自有一二名手题咏，岂似暴富之家，竟以小儿语搪塞了事呢？只因当日这贾妃未入宫时，自幼亦系贾母教养。后来添了宝玉，贾妃乃长姊，宝玉为幼弟，贾妃念母年将迈，始得此弟，是以独爱怜之。且同侍贾母，刻不相离。那宝玉未入学之先，三四岁时，已得元妃口传教授了几本书，识了数千字在腹中。虽为姊弟，有如母子。自入宫后，时时带信出来与父兄说：“千万好生扶养：不严不能成器，过严恐生不虞，且致祖母之忧。”眷念之心，刻刻不忘。前日贾政闻塾师赞他尽有才情，故于游园时聊一试之，虽非名公大笔，却是本家风味；且使贾妃见之，知爱弟所为，亦不负其平日切望之意。因此故将宝玉所题用了。那日未题完之处，后来又补题了许多。\n　　且说贾妃看了四字，笑道：“‘花溆’二字便好，何必‘蓼汀’？”侍坐太监听了，忙下舟登岸，飞传与贾政，贾政即刻换了。彼时舟临内岸，去舟上舆，便见琳宫绰约，桂殿巍峨，石牌坊上写着“天仙宝镜”四大字，贾妃命换了“省亲别墅”四字。于是进入行宫，只见庭燎绕空，香屑布地，火树琪花，金窗玉槛，说不尽帘卷虾须，毯铺鱼獭，鼎飘麝脑之香，屏列雉尾之扇。真是：\n　　　　金门玉户神仙府，桂殿兰宫妃子家。\n贾妃乃问：“此殿何无匾额？”随侍太监跪启道：“此系正殿，外臣未敢擅拟。”贾妃点头。礼仪太监请升座受礼，两阶乐起。二太监引赦、政等于月台下排班上殿，昭容传谕曰：“免。”乃退。又引荣国太君及女眷等自东阶升月台上排班，昭容再谕曰：“免。”于是亦退。\n　　茶三献，贾妃降座，乐止，退入侧室更衣，方备省亲车驾出园。至贾母正室，欲行家礼，贾母等俱跪止之。贾妃垂泪，彼此上前厮见，一手挽贾母，一手挽王夫人，三人满心皆有许多话，但说不出，只是呜咽对泣而已。邢夫人、李纨、王熙凤、迎春、探春、惜春等，俱在旁垂泪无言。半日，贾妃方忍悲强笑，安慰道：“当日既送我到那不得见人的去处，好容易今日回家，娘儿们这时不说不笑，反倒哭个不了，一会子我去了，又不知多早晚才能一见！”说到这句，不禁又哽咽起来。刑夫人忙上来劝解。贾母等让贾妃归坐，又逐次一一见过，又不免哭泣一番。然后东西两府执事人等在外厅行礼。其媳妇丫环行礼毕。贾妃叹道：“许多亲眷，可惜都不能见面！”王夫人启道：“现有外亲薛王氏及宝钗、黛玉在外候旨。外眷无职，不敢擅入。”贾妃即请来相见。一时薛姨妈等进来，欲行国礼，元妃降旨免过，上前各叙阔别。又有原带进宫的丫鬟抱琴等叩见，贾母连忙扶起，命入别室款待。执事太监及彩嫔昭容各侍从人等，宁府及贾赦那宅两处自有人款待，只留三四个小太监答应。母女姊妹，不免叙些久别的情景及家务私情。\n　　又有贾政至帘外问安行参等事。元妃又向其父说道：“田舍之家，齑盐布帛，得遂天伦之乐；今虽富贵，骨肉分离，终无意趣。”贾政亦含泪启道：“臣草芥寒门，鸠群鸦属之中，岂意得征凤鸾之瑞。今贵人上锡天恩，下昭祖德，此皆山川日月之精华，祖宗之远德，钟于一人，幸及政夫妇。且今上体天地生生之大德，垂古今未有之旷恩，虽肝脑涂地，岂能报效万一！惟朝乾夕惕，忠于厥职。伏愿圣君万岁千秋，乃天下苍生之福也。贵妃切勿以政夫妇残年为念。更祈自加珍爱，惟勤慎肃恭以侍上，庶不负上眷顾隆恩也。”贾妃亦嘱以“国事宜勤，暇时保养，切勿记念”。贾政又启：“园中所有亭台轩馆，皆系宝玉所题；如果有一二可寓目者，请即赐名为幸。”元妃听了宝玉能题，便含笑说道：“果进益了。”贾政退出。元妃因问：“宝玉因何不见？”贾母乃启道：“无职外男，不敢擅入。”元妃命引进来。小太监引宝玉进来，先行国礼毕，命他近前，携手揽于怀内，又抚其头颈笑道：“比先长了好些——”一语未终，泪如雨下。\n　　尤氏、凤姐等上来启道：“筵宴齐备，请贵妃游幸。”元妃起身，命宝玉导引，遂同诸人步至园门前。早见灯光之中，诸般罗列，进园先从“有凤来仪”、“红香绿玉”、“杏帘在望”、“蘅芷清芬”等处，登楼步阁，涉水缘山，眺览徘徊。一处处铺陈华丽，一桩桩点缀新奇。元妃极加奖赞，又劝：“以后不可太奢了，此皆过分。”既而来至正殿，降谕免礼归坐，大开筵宴，贾母等在下相陪，尤氏、李纨、凤姐等捧羹把盏。\n　　元妃乃命笔砚伺候，亲拂罗笺，择其喜者赐名。因题其园之总名曰“大观园”，正殿匾额云“顾恩思义”，对联云：\n　　　　天地启宏慈，赤子苍生同感戴；\n　　　　古今垂旷典，九州万国被恩荣。\n　　又改题：“有凤来仪”赐名“潇湘馆”。“红香绿玉”改作“怡红快绿”，赐名“怡红院”。“蘅芷清芬”赐名“蘅芜院”。“杏帘在望”赐名“浣葛山庄”。正楼曰“大观楼”。东面飞楼曰“缀锦楼”。西面叙楼曰“含芳阁”。更有“蓼风轩”、“藕香榭”、“紫菱洲”、“荇叶渚”等名。匾额有“梨花春雨”、“桐剪秋风”、“荻芦夜雪”等名。又命旧有匾联不可摘去。于是先题一绝句云：\n　　　　衔山抱水建来精，多少工夫筑始成！\n　　　　天上人间诸景备，芳园应锡“大观”名。\n　　题毕，向诸姐妹笑道：“我素乏捷才，且不长于吟咏，姐妹辈素所深知，今夜聊以塞责，不负斯景而已。异日少暇，必补撰《大观园记》并《省亲颂》等文，以记今日之事。妹等亦各题一匾一诗，随意发挥，不可为我微才所缚。且知宝玉能题咏，一发可喜。此中潇湘馆，蘅芜院二处，我所极爱；次之怡红院浣葛山庄；此四大处，必得别有章句题咏方妙。前所题之联虽佳，如今再各赋五言律一首，使我当面试过，方不负我自幼教授之苦心。”宝玉只得答应了，下来自去构思。\n　　迎春、探春、惜春三人中，要算探春又出于姊妹之上，然自忖似难与薛、林争衡，只得随众应命。李纨也勉强作成一绝。贾妃挨次看妹妹们的题咏，写道是：\n　　　　旷性怡情（匾额）\n　　　　迎春\n　　　　园成景物特精奇，奉命羞题额旷怡。\n　　　　谁信世间有此境，游来宁不畅神思？\n　　　　文采风流（匾额）\n　　　　探春\n　　　　秀水明山抱复回，风流文采胜蓬莱。\n　　　　绿裁歌扇迷芳草，红衬湘裙舞落梅。\n　　　　珠玉自应传盛世，神仙何幸下瑶台！\n　　　　名园一自邀游赏，未许凡人到此来。\n　　　　文章造化（匾额）\n　　　　惜春\n　　　　山水横拖千里外，楼台高起五云中。\n　　　　园修日月光辉里，景夺文章造化功。\n　　　　万象争辉（匾额）\n　　　　李纨\n　　　　名园筑就势巍巍，奉命多惭学浅微。\n　　　　精妙一时言不尽，果然万物有光辉。\n　　　　凝晖钟瑞〔匾额）\n　　　　薛宝钗\n　　　　芳园筑向帝城西，华日祥云笼罩奇。\n　　　　高柳喜迁莺出谷，修篁时待凤来仪。\n　　　　文风已著宸游夕，孝化应隆归省时。\n　　　　睿藻仙才瞻仰处，自惭何敢再为辞？\n　　　　世外仙源（匾额）\n　　　　林黛玉\n　　　　宸游增悦豫，仙境别红尘。\n　　　　借得山川秀，添来气象新。\n　　　　香融金谷酒，花媚玉堂人。\n　　　　何幸邀恩宠，宫车过往频。\n　　元妃看毕，称赏不已，又笑道：“终是薛、林二妹之作与众不同，非愚姊妹所及。”原来黛玉安心今夜大展奇才，将众人压倒，不想元妃只命一匾一咏，倒不好违谕多做，只胡乱做了一首五言律应命便罢了。\n　　时宝玉尚未做完，才做了“潇湘馆”与“蘅芜院”两首，正做“恰红院”一首，起稿内有“绿玉春犹卷”一句。宝钗转眼瞥见，便趁众人不理论，推他道：“贵人因不喜‘红香绿玉’四字，才改了‘怡红快绿’。你这会子偏又用‘绿玉’二字，岂不是有意和他分驰了？况且蕉叶之典故颇多，再想一个改了罢。”宝玉见宝钗如此说，便拭汗说道：“我这会子总想不起什么典故出处来！”宝钗笑道：“你只把‘绿玉’的‘玉’字改作‘蜡’字就是了。”宝玉道：“‘绿蜡’可有出处？”宝钗悄悄的顺嘴点头笑道：“亏你今夜不过如此，将来金殿对策，你大约的连‘赵钱孙李’都忘了呢！唐朝韩翊咏芭蕉诗头一句：‘冷烛无烟绿蜡干’都忘了么？”宝玉听了，不觉洞开心意，笑道：“该死，该死！眼前现成的句子竟想不到。姐姐真是‘一字师’了！从此只叫你师傅，再不叫姐姐了。”宝钗也悄悄的笑道：“还不快做上去，只姐姐妹妹的。谁是你姐姐？那上头穿黄袍的才是你姐姐呢。”一面说笑，因怕他耽延工夫，遂抽身走开了。\n　　宝玉续成了此首，共有三首。此时黛玉未得展才，心上不快。因见宝玉构思太苦，走至案旁，知宝玉只少“杏帘在望”一首，因叫他抄录前三首，却自己吟成一律，写在纸条上，搓成个团子，掷向宝玉跟前。宝玉打开一看，觉比自己做的三首高得十倍，遂忙恭楷誊完呈上。元妃看道是：\n　　　　有凤来仪\n　　　　宝玉\n　　　　秀玉初成实，堪宜待凤凰。\n　　　　竿竿青欲滴，个个绿生凉；\n　　　　迸砌防阶水，穿帘碍鼎香。\n　　　　莫摇分碎影，好梦正初长。\n　　　　蘅芷清芬\n　　　　蘅芜满静苑，萝薜助芬芳。\n　　　　软衬三春草，柔拖一缕香。\n　　　　轻烟迷曲径，冷翠湿衣裳。\n　　　　谁咏池塘曲？谢家幽梦长。\n　　　　怡红快绿\n　　　　深庭长日静，两两出婵娟。\n　　　　绿蜡春犹卷，红妆夜未眠。\n　　　　凭栏垂绛袖，倚石护清烟。\n　　　　对立东风里，主人应解怜。\n　　　　杏帘在望\n　　　　杏帘招客饮，在望有山庄。\n　　　　菱荇鹅儿水，桑榆燕子梁。\n　　　　一畦春韭熟，十全稻花香。\n　　　　盛世无饥馁，何须耕织忙。\n　　元妃看毕，喜之不尽，说：“果然进益了！”又指“杏帘”一首为四首之冠，遂将“浣葛山庄”改为“稻香村”。又命探春将方才十数首诗另以锦笺誊出，令太监传出与外厢。贾政等看了，都称颂不已。贾政又进《归省颂》。元妃又命以琼酪金脍等物，赐与宝玉并贾兰。——此时贾兰尚幼，未谙诸事，只不过随母依叔行礼而已。\n　　那时贾蔷带领一班女戏子在楼下，正等得不耐烦，只见一个太监飞跑下来，说：“做完了诗了，快拿戏单来！”贾蔷忙将戏目呈上，并十二个人的花名册子。少时，点了四出戏：第一出《豪宴》，第二出《乞巧》，第三出《仙缘》．第四出《离魂》。贾蔷忙张罗扮演起来，一个个歌有裂石之音，舞有天魔之态，虽是妆演的形容，却做尽悲欢的情状。\n　　刚演完了，一个太监托着一金盘糕点之属进来，问：“谁是龄官？”贾蔷便知是赐龄官之物，连忙接了，命龄官叩头。太监又道：“贵妃有谕，说：‘龄官极好，再做两出戏，不拘那两出就是了。’”贾蔷忙答应了，因命龄官做《游园》《惊梦》二出。龄官自为此二出非本角之戏，执意不从，定要做《相约》《相骂》二出。贾蔷扭不过他，只得依他做了。元妃甚喜，命：“莫难为了这女孩子，好生教习。”额外赏了两匹宫绸，两个荷包，并金银锞子之类。然后撤筵，将未到之处复又游玩。忽见山环佛寺，忙盥手进去焚香拜佛，又题一匾云“苦海慈航”。又额外加恩与一班幽尼女道。\n　　少时，太监跪启：“赐物俱齐，请验按例行赏。”乃呈上略节。元妃从头看了无话，即命照此而行。太监下来，一一发放。原来贾母的是金玉如意各一柄，沉香拐杖一根，伽楠念珠一串，“富贵长春”宫缎四匹，“福寿长春“宫绸四匹，紫金“笔锭如意”锞十锭，“吉庆有余”银锞十锭。邢夫人等二分，只减了如意、拐、珠四样。贾敬、贾赦、贾政等每分御制新书二部，宝墨二匣．金银盏各二只，表礼按前。宝钗、黛玉诸妹妹等，每人新书一部，宝砚一方，新样格式金银锞二对。宝玉和贾兰是金银项圈二个，金银锞二对。尤氏、李纨、凤姐等皆金银锞四锭，表礼四端。另有表礼二十四端，清钱五百串，是赏与贾母、王夫人及各姊妹房中奶娘众丫环的。贾珍、贾琏、贾环、贾蓉等皆是表礼一端，金银锞一对。其余彩缎百匹，白银千两，御酒数瓶，是赐东西两府及园中管理工程、陈设、答应及司戏、掌灯诸人的。外又有清钱三百串，是赐厨役，优伶、百戏、杂行人等的。\n    众人谢恩已毕，执事太监启道：“时已丑正三刻，请驾回銮。”元妃不由的满眼又滴下泪来，却又勉强笑着，拉了贾母王夫人的手不忍放，再四叮咛：“不须记挂，好生保养！如今天恩浩荡，一月许进内省视一次，见面尽容易的，何必过悲？倘明岁天恩仍许归省，不可如此奢华糜费了。”贾母等已哭的哽噎难言。元妃虽不忍别，奈皇家规矩违错把不得的，只得忍心上舆去了。这里众人好容易将贾母劝住，及王夫人搀扶出园去了。\n未知如何，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Just then someone announced that the assistant comptroller was waiting for Xifeng in the storehouse to issue some silk for the workmen, and another messenger came to ask her to check the gold and silver plate. Lady Wang and her maids were too busy to stay there.\n\n“We’d better not get in the way here,” observed Baochai.\n\nShe and Baoyu went to Yingchun’s room.\n\nLady Wang was busy every day until the tenth month, by which time all the accounts had been checked and cleared, all antiques and curios had been placed in position, and all the birds — storks, deer, rabbits, chickens, geese and so forth — had been purchased and were being reared in the Garden. Jia Qiang had also trained two dozen players and rehearsed more than twenty operas; and a company of young Buddhist and Taoist nuns had learned to recite sutras and litanies. Then Jia Zheng, feeling more at ease, asked the Lady Dowager to inspect the Garden and suggest any further improvements that occurred to her so that there should be no omissions. Not until he was satisfied on this score did he feel emboldened to send in a memorial. The Emperor’s rescript read:\n\n“On the fifteenth of the first month next year, the Feast of Lanterns, We grant Our Consort leave to visit her parents.”\n\nUpon receipt of this decree the Jia family worked even harder, with no time to rest day or night, so that they could not even properly celebrate the New Year.\n\nIn a flash the Lantern Festival was approaching. Starting from the eighth of the first month, eunuchs came from the Palace to inspect the various halls and set up screens in the places designated for the Imperial Consort to change her clothes, sit, receive homage, feast or retire. The chief eunuch in charge of public security also arrived with a number of minor eunuchs to take defensive measures and show the Jia family where the Imperial Consort’s attendants were to mount guard and where to wait on her, where to enter or leave the premises, where to take their meals and where to make reports. The officers of the Ministry of Works and the police commissioners of the five districts had the streets cleared and loiterers moved on, while Jia She and the others supervised the work of the craftsmen making lanterns and fireworks. By the fourteenth everything was ready. And not a soul in the whole establishment slept that night.\n\nAt five the next morning, when the drum struck the fifth watch, the Lady Dowager and the rest, all in full court costume, assembled in the main hall of the Rong Mansion. The Garden was resplendent with silk streamers and embroidered curtains, glittering with gold, silver and jewels, while from the tripods and vases rose the fragrance of rare incense and fresh flowers. Silence reigned, not a cough was heard. Jia She and the other men were drawn up outside the West Street Gate, the Lady Dowager and the ladies outside the main gate of the Rong Mansion. All the approaches were screened. They waited and waited, but there was no sign of anything happening. At last a eunuch rode up on a pony. Jia Zheng went over to meet him and asked for news.\n\n“It’s early yet,” said the eunuch. “Her Highness won’t have her lunch until one. Then she’ll go to offer incense in the Baoying Temple at two, and after that she’ll enter the Palace of Great Splendour to feast and watch the lanterns. She will ask leave of the Emperor at seven, and not till eight will she set out for your honourable mansion.”\n\nWhen Xifeng heard this she proposed, “In that case, why don’t the old lady and Her Ladyship go and rest in their own quarters for a while? They can come back when it’s time.” The Lady Dowager and Lady Wang accordingly went off, and Xifeng was left in charge of the Garden.\n\nAttendants ushered the eunuchs into their quarters to have a meal and some wine, while servants brought in candles and lit the lanterns everywhere.\n\nThen from outside came the sound of running horses. In a little while a dozen or so eunuchs ran up panting, clapping their hands. This was the signal for the arrival of the Imperial Consort. The other eunuchs understood and stood waiting in their respective places. Jia She and the men of the clan took their stations outside the West Street Gate, the Lady Dowager and the women outside the main gate. They waited in silence. Presently two eunuchs on horseback trotted slowly up. Dismounting at the West Street Gate, they led their horses behind the screens and took their stand there facing west.\n\nAfter a considerable interval another pair arrived and went through the same procedure. Soon they were followed by some ten pairs of eunuchs, and now faint music could be heard. A procession of pairs of eunuchs with embroidered banners, pheasant plumes and palace fans, gold-inlaid censers burning imperial incense, passed slowly by. Then came a curved-handled state umbrella of yellow gold embroidered with seven phoenixes, followed by imperial consort’s crown, robe, sash and slippers, as well as eunuchs carrying a rosary, embroidered handkerchiefs, a rinse-bowl, fly-whisks and the like.\n\nLast of all, when this procession had passed, eight eunuchs bore slowly forward a gold-topped palanquin with phoenix panels and imperial-yellow curtains.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and her party promptly fell on their knees, but eunuchs raised them up.\n\nCome, take the Imperial Chariot through the main gate to the entrance of a courtyard in the east, where eunuchs knelt and invited the Imperial Consort to alight and change her clothes. Entering the gate, she saw that the eunuchs had withdrawn and only palace maids were in attendance. As Yuanchun stepped down from the chariot, she was struck by the sight of a profusion of lanterns of every kind, all exquisitely made of silk and gauze. Over them was a board inscribed with four words: “Compassion and Virtue Illumined.” She entered a room to change her clothes, then re-emerged to mount the chariot and enter the garden.\n\nShe saw smoky incense wreathed about her, and flowers and shadows vied in brilliance. Everywhere were dazzling lanterns and the sound of fluting and singing. No pen could do justice to that scene of peaceful magnificence and luxurious gaiety.\n\nBut let us return to the Imperial Consort in her palanquin. As she gazed at the splendour within and without the garden she nodded and sighed, “This is too extravagant!”\n\nSuddenly a eunuch knelt by the side of the way and begged her to board a boat. She did so and saw a clear stream like a jade belt, its stone banks carved like dragons. On both sides, lanterns of crystal and glass of every colour were lit, so that it was like a stream of silver or snow, while the willows and apricot trees above, though bereft of leaves, had artificial blossoms and leaves of silk and paper pasted on their branches, as well as thousands of lanterns. And all the waterfowl and lotus plants in the pool were made of conch—shell, mother—of—pearl, feathers and gold and silver thread. It was a crystal world, sparkling with precious stones. And needless to say, the boat was decorated with pots of flowers, pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, oars and paddles of cassia and orchid wood.\n\nThey entered a stone channel, above which was a lantern inscribed with the words: “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour.” Dear readers, you may wonder why such names composed by Baoyu on the spur of the moment on his father’s orders were now adopted. The reason was that the Jia family, being a house of scholars, could have found some eminent writer to compose inscriptions instead of using a boy’s casual efforts. But the Imperial Consort had been brought up from childhood by the Lady Dowager, and after Baoyu’s birth she had lavished such love on this younger brother, the son of her mother’s declining years, that they had been inseparable. Before he started school and when he was only three or four, she had taught him to recite several texts and to recognize several thousand characters. Thus, though they were sister and brother, they were more like mother and son. After she entered the Palace, she constantly wrote to her father to urge that her brother should be well brought up. “If not strictly taught, he will never amount to anything,” she warned, “but if you are too strict and anything happens to him, it will break my grandmother’s heart and distress me too.” Her solicitude was unceasing. And when Jia Zheng heard his tutor praise Baoyu for his natural talent, he had put him to the test during this stroll in the garden. Although the inscriptions Baoyu produced were not in the class of great masters, they were at least in the family tradition; and when the Imperial Consort saw them and knew they were her beloved brother’s work, she would not think her hopes for him had been misplaced. That was why Jia Zheng had made use of them. Later, more inscriptions were added for the places which had not been finished that day.\n\nWhen the Imperial Consort read the inscription “Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour” she smiled and said, “‘Flowery Harbour’ is good, but why ‘Smartweed Bank’?” On hearing this, the eunuch in attendance disembarked and hurried ashore to report to Jia Zheng, who at once had the name changed.\n\nBy this time the boat had reached the further shore and once more the Imperial Consort left the boat and mounted her palanquin. She saw before her magnificent temples and lofty halls, while on a marble archway in front was inscribed in letters of gold: “Precinct of the Immortals’ Jewel.” She ordered this to be changed to “Dwelling ofRecalled Spirit.” Then she entered the palace, where torches flared in the court, incense filled the air, and fiery trees and jewelled flowers vied in splendour. Truly:\n\nA golden gateway to a court of jade,\n\nA palace fit for fairy queen not mortal maid.\n\n“Why is there no tablet here?” asked the Imperial Consort.\n\nA eunuch fell on one knee and replied, “This is the main palace. No subject would venture to write for it.”\n\nShe ordered a tablet to be prepared. And when the attendants asked her to take the seat of honour to receive the homage of her family, music struck up on either side and two eunuchs invited Jia She and the other men to ascend the terrace and pay their respects. But a lady-in-waiting issued the order, “By Imperial Decree the homage is to be waived.” The eunuchs accordingly ordered Jia She and the rest to withdraw. Then the Lady Dowager of the Rong Mansion and the other ladies of the family advanced to the foot of the steps to make their kotow, but again the order was given to dispense with this.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the women of the family mounted the terrace by the east steps and arranged themselves in order. The imperial lady-in-waiting announced the Imperial Consort’s command that they should dispense with this ceremony, whereupon they withdrew.\n\nAfter tea had been served three times, the Imperial Consort descended from the throne and the music ceased. She retired to a side-room to change her clothes, then a carriage was made ready for her visit to her own apartments. Once in the Lady Dowager’s hall, she would have performed the rites proper between an elder and a junior but the old lady and the rest knelt to prevent this. The Imperial Consort’s tears fell as she exchanged greetings with them. And then, with one hand on the Lady Dowager’s arm and the other on Lady Wang’s, but too choked with emotion to speak, she could only sob. Lady Xing, Li Wan, Wang Xifeng, Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun stood near her in silence, weeping.\n\nAt last she controlled herself and forced a smile to comfort them.\n\n“You sent me to that forbidden palace which is hard to leave,” she said. “Now that I’m home after so long, if instead of laughing and chatting we give way to tears, in a little while I shall have to go back without having said all I want to say, and we shan’t know when we can meet again.”\n\nAt that she broke down once more.\n\nLady Xing and the others did their best to console her. The Lady Dowager asked the Imperial Consort to be seated, and after she had greeted each of them in turn they had another cry. Then the stewards of both mansions in the east and west courts paid their respects outside the hall, followed by the wives of the stewards and the maids of the household.\n\n“What a pity it is that so many kinsfolk can’t meet!” sighed the Imperial Consort.\n\n“We have two outside relatives here, Aunt Xue and the daughters of her sister Aunt Lin,” Lady Wang explained. “But as they are not related to the Imperial House, they dare not presume to pay their respects without Your Highness’ permission.”\n\nThe Imperial Consort at once asked them to come in, and Aunt Xue and the two girls entered. They would have performed the rites of the court, but she exempted them and came forward to chat with them instead.\n\nThen Qinzhong and the other maids who had accompanied her to the Palace knelt to pay their respects, and the Lady Dowager quickly raised them up and sent them to another room to be entertained.\n\nThe eunuchs in charge and the other attendants from the Palace were wined and dined outside, while only three or four young eunuchs were left to wait on the Imperial Consort. Mother and daughters, aunt and nieces and sisters, after their long separation, had much to say to each other about domestic affairs and their private feelings.\n\nPresently Jia Zheng from outside the portiere asked after his daughter’s health.\n\n“What pleasure can I take in a life cut off from my family?” she asked. “Though a poor home with only salted cabbage to eat and plain silk to wear affords the happiness of being together. But now, for all our wealth and splendour, though we are parted I cannot even say what is in my heart.” She broke down again.\n\nHer father too repressed his sobs.\n\n“Though my humble house is filled with kites and crows, I never expected to be blessed with a phoenix from the palace,” he said. “Your Noble Highness must not grieve for your ageing parents. We beg you to take better care of your own health and be ever watchful and diligent in serving the Emperor, so as to prove yourself worthy of his grace and kindness. I, your subject, will do my best to serve the throne faithfully day and night. I pray that the Emperor will live ten thousand years and bring peace to the whole world.”\n\nHe added, “Your Noble Highness must not worry over your unworthy parents. We beg you, moreover, to take more care of your health. Be cautious and diligent in serving His Majesty, so as to prove worthy of his great goodness.”\n\nThe Imperial Consort also urged her father to devote himself to affairs of state, look after his health and not grieve.\n\nHe then asked her to name the inscriptions she had approved in the garden, to be inscribed on the tablets.\n\n“I hear that all the inscriptions in the garden were composed by Baoyu,” she remarked with a smile. “He has certainly improved. Some of the inscriptions are rather good.”\n\n“He has suggested quite a few inscriptions,” Jia Zheng told her.\n\n“Which ones? Let me hear them.”\n\nWhen he had named some, she approved them and said, “Why isn’t he here?”\n\n“Being a commoner without official rank, he dare not appear before you,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\nShe ordered him to be brought in. The young eunuch ushered Baoyu in. Having paid his homage, he was told to approach. His sister took him by the hand and drew him into her arms, then stroked his neck.\n\n“You’ve grown so much taller—” she began, but broke off abruptly, overcome by emotion.\n\nMadam You and Xifeng stepped forward to announce, “The feast is ready. Will Her Highness condescend to visit the Garden?”\n\nThe Imperial Consort rose and asked Baoyu to lead the way. She and the rest walked to the gate of the Garden, where they saw coloured lanterns of every kind, all beautifully made. As they entered the Garden they saw:\n\nWhere the Phoenix Alights,  \nRed Fragrance and Green Jade,  \nApproach to Apricot Tavern  \nand Pure Scent of Alpinia and Iris.\n\nShe climbed pavilions, entered kiosks, crossed streams and climbed hills, pausing wherever she pleased to enjoy the view. All the splendours and novelties now received her highest commendation. But she warned them:\n\n“You mustn’t be so extravagant in future. This is overdoing things.”\n\nPresently they reached the main hall, where she dispensed with the ceremonies and took a seat while a feast was served. The Lady Dowager and the rest sat at tables below. Lady Yu, Li Wan and Xifeng served the food and poured the wine.\n\nThen the Imperial Consort called for writing-brush and inkstone and, with her own hand, wrote some inscriptions for the pleasure-grounds. She named the grounds Prospect Garden. The tablet over the main hall she inscribed: “Recalling Imperial Favour, Mindful of Duty.” The couplet was:\n\nCompassion vast as the universe extends to old and young,\nGrace unknown in past or present renews the flowers and trees.\n\nShe changed the name “Where the Phoenix Alights” to “Bamboo Lodge.” “Red Fragrance and Green Jade” was changed to “Happy Red Court.” “Rue-scented Bridge and Lotus Fragrance” became “Alpinia Park.” “Paddy-Sweet Cottage” she named “All-Spice Court.” The main tower was called “Grand View Tower,” the east tower “Fragrant Tower,” the west one “Arbour of Variegated Splendour.” There were other names such as “Smartweed Breeze Cot,” “Lotus Fragrance Anchorage,” “Purple Caltrop Isle” and “Watercress Isle.” The four horizontal inscriptions were: “Pear Blossom in Spring Rain,” “Plantain and Cuckoo,” “Wistaria and Evening Cloud,” and “Reed Catkins and Autumn Moon.”\n\nShe ordered the old inscriptions to be replaced by the new ones she had just composed, then wrote this poem:\n\nSecluded spots by hills and water fine\nHave been designed and wrought with skill divine.\nAll nature’s beauties here are now arrayed;\n“Prospect” is the name fit to be conveyed.\n\n“I’ve never had much talent or facility for versifying, as all of you know,” she told her girl cousins. “This is just a makeshift to amuse ourselves tonight and not let these lovely scenes go uncommemorated. But some other day when I have time I mean to write a prose account of this visit as well as a song called ‘Family Reunion,’ to commemorate this happy occasion. Now I want each of you to write an inscription and a poem to go with it. Never mind if you’re not too satisfied with the result. I just want to see what you can do. And I know Cousin Bao can write verses, so I’d like to see his too.”\n\nShe particularly liked Bamboo Lodge and Alpinia Park, with Happy Red Court and All-Spice Court as her next favourites, and she insisted that these four places must have poems composed for them which should not be bound by the rules governing regulated verse.\n\n“Although the couplet I wrote just now is quite good,” she said, “it doesn’t compare with the lines you girls can produce. So I want each of you to write a pentasyllabic regulated verse to let me test you. If I find you’ve made progress, that will reward me for my pains in teaching you as a child.”\n\nBaoyu had to agree, and he went off to think something up.\n\nOf Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun, Tanchun was the most gifted; but she knew she was no match for the other two girls and had to comply with the order. Li Wan too did her best to write a poem.\n\nThe Imperial Consort read their verses in turn. Yingchun had written this on “Expansive Contentment”:\n\nThis pleasure ground by labour wrought\nIs to “Expansive Contentment” named.\nWho could believe such paradise on earth\nAs this exists, where one may roam elate?\n\nTanchun’s poem on “Nature’s Beauty and Refinement” was:\n\nHills and streams winding in beauty rare,\nNature’s refinement here is at its height.\nGreen fans of singers mid sweet herbs are lost,\nRed skirts of dancers mid fallen blossoms dance.\nWe wish this goodly garden’s fine estate\nMay be enjoyed by immortal company.\nWhat luck that we this famous garden view,\nNormally closed to common mortals’ eyes!\n\nXichun’s poem on “The Wonder of Creation” was:\n\nMountains and rivers span a thousand li,\nPavilions touch the clouds five-coloured.\nIn the radiance of the sun and moon\nThe garden’s scenes vie with creation’s wonders.\n\nLi Wan’s poem on “All Nature Vies in Splendour” was:\n\nThis pleasure ground in all its glorious might\nShames all mansions mortals may design.\nIts marvels cannot be described in words;\nAll nature here vies in magnificence.\n\nXue Baochai\n\nIn fairy gardens built west of the Sunlit City,  \nBy sun and auspicious clouds entranced,  \nWillows rejoice when orioles from the valley come;  \nBamboos await the phoenix in fine array.  \nSuch literary grace is displayed after the imperial tour,  \nSuch filial devotion at the time of her visit home.  \nWe gaze in awe on her immortal genius,  \nToo abashed to display our own incompetence.\n\nFairyland Beyond the World (Board Inscription)  \n\nLin Daiyu\n\nThe imperial tour enhances her delight;  \nThis fairyland is far from mortal dust.  \nIt borrows from the landscape its loveliness,  \nAdds to the scene an ever-fresh charm.  \nThe feast is sweet as that in Golden Valley;  \nFair as in Jade Hall the flowers smile.  \nHow to express the honour done us?  \nFrequent the imperial chariot that passes by!\n\nWhen Yuanchun had read these she expressed warm approval. \"Cousin Baochai's and Cousin Daiyu's are indeed superior to all the others,\" she said with a smile. \"As for us sisters, we just can't write so well.\"\n\nDaiyu had meant to excel herself that night and win all the credit. But the Imperial Consort had only asked for one inscription and one poem, and not feeling it would be right to write more on her own initiative she had simply dashed off a pentameter verse to carry out her instructions.\n\nBaoyu had not yet finished. He had completed \"Bamboo Lodge\" and \"Alpinia Park\" and was now working on \"Happy Red Court.\" He had drafted the line: \"In spring the green jade's still rolled up.\" Baochai, glancing round to make sure no one was watching, nudged his arm.\n\n\"Her Highness doesn't like the words 'red fragrant' and 'green jade',\" she whispered. \"That's why she changed 'red fragrant and green jade' into 'happy red and delighted green.' If you use 'green jade' again, won't that look as if you're deliberately defying her? Besides, there are plenty of allusions to plantain leaves. You'd better think of another.\"\n\nBaoyu wiped the sweat from his forehead. \"I can't for the moment think of any other allusion,\" he said frantically.\n\n\"Just change 'jade' into 'wax,'\" she suggested softly.\n\n\"Has 'green wax' an origin?\"\n\n\"You're so keyed up tonight that if this goes on you'll probably forget even the first line of the Thousand Names classic before long. Have you forgotten the line by the Tang poet Qian Wei: 'The cold candle without smoke greens the wax dry'?\"\n\nBaoyu's mind cleared as if by magic. \"What an idiot I am!\" he exclaimed. \"I couldn't remember an allusion that's on the tip of my tongue. Sister, you're my one-word teacher. From now on I must address you as 'master' and give up calling you 'sister'.\"\n\nBaochai smiled and whispered, \"Hurry up now. Don't go on calling me sister or master. Who am I to be your sister? That girl in yellow over there is your sister.\" With that she walked away, chuckling, for fear that further talk might hold him up.\n\nOnce this poem was done, Baoyu had three in all. Daiyu, who had not been able to show her full powers, was feeling disgruntled. Noticing how hard Baoyu was having to work, she strolled over to his desk. When she saw that he had only \"The Hopeful Sign\" left to do, she told him to copy out the three he had ready while she composed one for him on the sly. Then, having written it on a piece of paper, she crumpled it into a ball and tossed it to him.\n\nUncrumpling it, Baoyu found a poem better by far than his own three put together. In great delight he made a clean copy and handed it in together with the rest.\n\nYuanchun read as follows:\n\nThe Phoenix Dance\n\nby Baoyu\n\nWhen first the phoenix alights,  \nfruits formed on the jade-like bamboo,  \neach stem so verdant, drips with dew,  \neach leafy cluster shields from heat;  \nto keep out the dripping from the wall  \ntheir shadows bar the incense from the court;  \nbut do not shake these green shadows,  \nfor the happy dream is not yet done.\n\nPure Fragrance of Alpinia and Iris\n\nAlpinia fills the courtyard,  \nfragrant creepers enhance its beauty,  \nsoftly touching the spring grass,  \ngently waving a scent,  \nlight mists hide the winding paths,  \ncold dew damps the clothes;  \nwho will sing the poolside song?  \nThe Xie family's sweet dream is long.\n\nHappy Red and Delighted Green\n\nIn the quiet court deep in the day,  \nBy the two plantains flanking the stones,  \nThe leaves in the breeze are a green mist,  \nTheir shadows at noon dark clouds make;  \nThe poet is guarded from the rain,  \nThe drunkard's sleeves are wet with dew;  \nThey nod to each other, full of love,  \nAs the master lies in the shade.\n\nA pair of lovely maids there stand,\nGreen wax the spring buds yet furled,\nRed blooms at night have not been seen.\nFrom the rail hang crimson sleeves,\nThe rock is veiled in mist serene.\nThey stand there facing the breeze,\nTheir mistress should feel tenderness.\nProspect Of Apricot Tavern\nApricot Tavern invites all to drink,\nA hillside farm can be seen in the distance.\nOver water flecked with duckweed swims the goose,\nMulberry and elm trees line the swallows’ nests.\nThe young leeks ripen in spring fields,\nThe scent of rice wafts for miles around.\nIn this rich year no one goes hungry,\nWhat need to toil at weaving and farming?\n\nThe Imperial Consort was delighted by these verses. “He has certainly made progress!” she exclaimed, declaring the last poem the best of the four. And she changed the name of Alpinia Park to Paddy-Sweet Cottage. She ordered Tanchun to copy out all ten poems she had selected on satin paper to be sent by a eunuch to her father. When Jia Zheng and the others had read them, they were full of praise. He then presented her with a “Eulogy on the Visit Home.”\n\nThe Imperial Consort also ordered that sweet milk and dainties of minced meat in gold leaf should be given to Baoyu and Jia Lan. The latter was still too young to understand all that was going on and simply followed his mother and uncle when paying his respects.\n\nBy now Jia Qiang downstairs was growing impatient with his actresses’ long wait. At last a eunuch ran down. “They’ve finished the poems,” he said. “Quick, give me the play-bill.”\n\nJia Qiang promptly handed it over with a list of the twelve actresses’ names. Four plays were chosen: The Sumptuous Feast, The Double Seventh Festival, The Fairy’s Return and The Departure of the Soul. At once Jia Qiang bustled about getting the players ready. They sang with the rapture of rocks splitting, danced with the abandon of sky demons. Although this was only acting, it evoked the extremes of grief and joy.\n\nAs soon as the performance ended a eunuch came in holding on a golden tray pastries and other delicacies, and asked which of the players was Lingguan. Realizing that this was a gift for her, Jia Qiang took the tray and made her kowtow her thanks.\n\n“Her Highness would like to say that Lingguan is very good,” the eunuch announced. “She is to perform two more pieces. Any two she likes.”\n\nJia Qiang assented and urged Lingguan to choose two items from The Peony Pavilion. But Lingguan, considering these unsuited to her voice, insisted on performing instead two scenes from The Bracelet and the Locket. As Jia Qiang could not override her, he let her have her way. The Imperial Consort was so amused that she ordered:\n\n“Don’t force her. Let her do whatever she likes.” She gave Lingguan two rolls of imperial silk, two pouches and some gold and silver ingots. Then the feast ended and she visited other places which she had not yet seen. When they came to a Buddhist temple nestling among hills, she washed her hands and went in to burn incense and worship Buddha, also inscribing for it the name: “Mercy Saved From Sea of Woes.” In addition, she showed extra favour to the Buddhist nuns and Taoist priestesses there.\n\nPresently a eunuch knelt to report, “The gifts are all ready. Will Her Highness please inspect them and decide on the distribution?”\n\nHe presented a list which the Imperial Consort read through and then approved. The eunuch went downstairs to distribute the gifts accordingly.\n\nTo the Lady Dowager she gave two ju-yi sceptres, one of gold and the other of jade, a staff of agalloch eaglewood, a string of beads of keen-nan incense, four lengths of red brocade with designs suggesting “riches, rank and eternal youth,” four lengths of silk with designs suggesting “good fortune, longevity and eternal youth,” ten gold ingots shaped like ju-yi sceptres inscribed “Felicity and peace,” and ten silver ingots inscribed “Riches and honours.”\n\nLady Xing and the others received the same with the exception of the sceptres, staff and beads.\n\nJia Jing, Jia She and Jia Zheng each received two new books issued by the Imperial Press, two cases of rare inksticks, two gold and two silver cups, and the same gifts as before.\n\nBaochai, Daiyu and the other girls were each given one new book, a rare inkstone, and two pairs of gold and silver ingots of a new design.\n\nBaoyu and Jia Lan were each given a gold and a silver necklet and two pairs of gold and silver ingots.\n\nTo Madam You, Li Wan and Xifeng went four gold and silver ingots apiece and four lengths of silk.\n\nThere were in addition twenty-four lengths of silk and five hundred strings of newly minted cash for the nurses and maids attending the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and the young ladies.\n\nJia Zhen, Jia Lian, Jia Huan and Jia Rong each received one new book, one case of rare inksticks, and two pairs of ingots identical with those given to the ladies.\n\nJia Huan, Jia Qiang and the rest each received a roll of silk and a pair of gold and silver ingots. The hundred rolls of variegated silk, thousand taels of silver and several bottles of imperial wine were for the two mansions of Rong and Ning and those in charge of construction, furnishing, ushering, operas and lanterns in the Garden. In addition, three hundred strings of cash were for the cooks, actors, acrobats and other outside attendants.\n\nWhen all had expressed their thanks, a eunuch announced, “It is now 2.45 a.m. Your Highness should return to the Palace.”\n\nThe Imperial Consort’s eyes filled with tears again, but she forced a smile and clung to the hands of the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, unable to bear the parting.\n\n“Don’t grieve for me,” she begged them. “Take good care of yourselves. Thanks to the Emperor’s kindness I shall be allowed to visit you once a month. So we shall see each other often — there is no need for you to be so upset. If next year I am again permitted to come, you must not be so extravagant.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the rest were sobbing too much to reply. And although Yuanchun could not bring herself to leave, she could not disobey the rules of the Court. Reluctantly she mounted her palanquin and was borne away.\n\nIt took the others some time to comfort the Lady Dowager and help Lady Wang out of the Garden. But more of this in the next chapter."
