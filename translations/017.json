  "original": "话说秦钟既死，宝玉痛哭不止，李贵等好容易劝解半日方住，归时还带馀哀。贾母帮了几十两银子，外又另备奠仪，宝玉去吊祭。七日后便送殡掩埋了，别无记述。只有宝玉日日感悼，思念不已，然亦无可如何了。又不知过了几时才罢。\n　　这日贾珍等来回贾政：“园内工程俱已告竣，大老爷已瞧过了，只等老爷瞧了，或有不妥之外，再行改造，好题匾额对联。”贾政听了，沉思一会，说道：“这匾对倒是一件难事。论礼该请贵妃赐题才是，然贵妃若不亲观其景，亦难悬拟。苦直待贵妃游幸时再行请题，若大景致，若干亭榭，无字标题，任是花柳山水，也断不能生色。”众清客在旁笑答道：“老世翁所见极是。如今我们有个主意，各处匾对断不可少，亦断不可定。如今且按其景致，或两字、三字、四字，虚合其意拟了来，暂且做出灯匾对联悬了，待贵妃游幸时，再请定名，岂不两全？”贾政听了道：“所见不差。我们今日且看看去，只管题了，若妥便用，若不妥，将雨村请来，令他再拟。”众人笑道：“老爷今日一拟定佳，何必又待雨村。”贾政笑道：“你们不知：我自幼于花鸟山水题咏上就平平的，如今上了年纪，且案牍劳烦，于这恰情悦性的文章更生疏了。便拟出来，也不免迂腐，反使花柳园亭因而减色，转没意思。”众清客道：“这也无妨。我们大家看了公拟，各举所长，优则存之，劣则删之，未为不可。”贾政道：“此论极是。且喜今日天气和暖，大家去逛逛。”说着，起身引众人前往。贾珍先去园中知会。\n　　可巧近日宝玉因思念秦钟，忧伤不已，贾母常命人带他到新园子里来玩耍。此时也才进去，忽见贾珍来了，和他笑道：“你还不快出去呢，一会子老爷就来了。”宝玉听了，带着奶娘小厮们，一溜烟跑出园来。方转过弯，顶头看见贾政引着众客来了，躲之不及，只得一旁站住。贾政近来闻得代儒称赞他专能对对，虽不喜读书，却有些歪才，所以此时便命他跟入园中，意欲试他一试。宝玉未知何意，只得随往。\n　　刚至园中，只见贾珍带领许多执事人旁边侍立。贾政道：“你且把园门关上，我们先瞧外面，再进去。”贾珍命人将门关上。贾政先秉正看门，只见正门五间，上面筒瓦泥鳅脊，那门栏窗俱是细雕时新花样，并无朱粉涂饰。一色水磨群墙，下面白石台阶，凿成西番莲花样。左右一望，雪白粉墙，下面虎皮石砌成纹理，不落富丽俗套，自是喜欢。遂命开门进去。只见一带翠嶂挡在面前。众清客都道：“好山，好山！！”贾政道：“非此一山，一进来园中所有之景悉入目中，更有何趣？”众人都道：“极是。非胸中大有之景悉入目中，更有何趣？”众人都道：“极是。非胸中大有丘壑，焉能想到这里。”说毕，往前一望，见白石，或如鬼怪，或似猛兽，纵横拱立。上面苔藓斑驳，或藤萝掩映，其中微露羊肠小径。贾政道：“我们就从此小径游去，回来由那一边出去，方可遍览。”\n　　说毕，命贾珍前导，自己扶了宝玉，逶迤走进山口。抬头忽见山上有镜面白石一块，正是迎面留题处。贾政回头笑道：“诸公请看，此处题以何名方妙？”众人听说，也百说该题“叠翠”二字的，也有说该题“锦嶂”的，又有说“赛香炉”的，又有说“小终南”的，种种名色，不止几十个。原来众客心中，早知贾政要试宝玉的才情，故此只将些俗套敷衍。宝玉也知此意。贾政听了，便回头命宝玉拟来。宝玉道：“尝听见古人说：‘编新不如述旧，刻古终胜雕今。’况这里并非主山正景，原无可题，不过是探景的一进步耳。莫如直书古人‘曲径通幽’这旧句在上，倒也大方。”众人听了，赞道：“是极，好极！二世兄天分高，才情远，不似我们读腐了书的。”贾政笑道：“不当过奖他。他年小的人，不过以一知充十用，取笑罢了。再侯选拟。”\n　　说着，进入石洞，只见佳木茏葱，奇花烂漫，一带清流，从花木深处泻于石隙之下。再进数步，渐向北边，平坦宽豁，两边飞楼插空，雕甍绣槛，皆隐于山坳树杪之间。俯而视之，但见青溪泻玉，石磴穿云，白石为栏，环抱池沼，石桥三港，兽面衔吐。桥上有亭，贾政与诸人到亭内坐了，问：“诸公以何题此？”诸人都说：“当日欧阳公《醉翁亭记》有云：‘有亭翼然’，就名‘翼然’罢。”贾政笑道：“‘翼然’虽佳，但此亭压水而成，还须偏于水题为称。依我拙裁，欧阳公句：‘泻于两峰之间’，竟用他这一个‘泻’字。”有一客道：“是极，是极。意是‘泻玉’二字妙。”贾政拈须寻思，因叫宝玉也拟一个来。宝玉问道：“老爷方才所说已是。但如今追究了去，似乎当日欧阳公题酿泉用一‘泻’字则妥，今日此泉也用‘泻’字，似乎不妥。况此处既为省亲别墅，亦当依应制之体，用此等字亦似粗陋不雅。求再拟蕴藉含蓄者。”贾政笑道：“诸公听此论何如？方才众人编新，你说‘不如述古’；如今我们述古，你又说粗陋不妥。你且说你的。”宝玉道：“用‘泻玉’二字，则不若‘沁芳’二字，岂不新雅？”贾政拈须点头不语。众人都忙迎合，称赞宝玉才情不凡。贾政道：“匾上二字容易。再作一副七言对来。”宝玉四顾一望，机上心来，乃念道：\n　　　　绕堤柳借三篙翠，隔岸花分一脉香。\n    贾政听了，点头微笑。众人又称赞一番。\n    于是出亭过池，一山一石，一花一木，莫不着意观览。忽抬头见前面一带粉垣，数楹修舍，有千百竿翠竹遮映。众人都道：“好个所在！”于是大家进入，只见进门便是曲折游廊，阶下石子漫成甬路，上面小小三间房舍，两明一暗，里面都是合着地步打的床几椅案。从里间房里，又有一小门，出去却是后园，有大株梨花，阔叶芭蕉，又有两间小小退步。后院墙下忽开一隙，得泉一派，开沟尺许，灌入墙内，绕阶缘屋至前院，盘旋竹下而出。贾政笑道：“这一处倒还好，若能月夜至此窗下读书，也不枉虚生一世。”说着便看宝玉，唬的宝玉忙垂了头。众人忙用闲话解说。又二客说：“此处的匾该题四个字。”贾政笑问：“那四字？”一个道是：“淇水遗风。”贾政道：“俗。”又一个道是：“睢园遗迹。”贾政道：“也俗。”贾珍在旁说道：“还是宝兄弟拟一个罢。”贾政道：“他未曾做，先要议论人家的好歹，可见是个轻薄东西。”众客道：“议论的是，也无奈他何。”贾政忙道：“休如此纵了他。”因说道：“今日任你狂为乱道，等说出议论来，方许你做。方才众人说的，可有使得的没有？”宝玉见问，便答道：“都似不妥。”贾政冷笑道：“怎么不妥？”宝玉道：“这是第一处行幸之所，必须颂圣方可。若用四字的匾，又有古人现成的，何必再做？”贾政道：“难道‘淇水’，‘睢园’不是古人的？”宝玉道：“这太板了。莫若‘有凤来仪’四字。”众人都哄然叫妙。贾政点头道：“畜生，畜生！可谓‘管窥蠢测’矣。”因命：“再题一联来。”宝玉便念道：\n　　　　宝鼎茶闲烟尚绿，幽窗棋罢指犹凉。\n　　贾政摇头道：“也未见长。”说毕，引人出来。方欲走时，忽想起一事来，问贾珍道：“这些院落屋宇，并几案桌椅都算有了。还有那些帐幔帘子并陈设玩器古董，可也都是一处一处合式配就的么？”贾珍回道：“那陈设的东西早已添了许多，自然临期合式陈设。帐幔帘子，昨日听见琏兄弟说，还不全。那原是一起工程之时就画了各处的图样，量准尺寸，就打发人办去的，想必昨日得了一半。”贾政听了，便知此事不是贾珍的首尾，便叫人去唤贾琏。一时来了，贾政问他：“共有几宗？现今得了几宗？尚欠几宗？”贾琏见问，忙向靴筒内取出靴掖里装的一个纸折略节来，看了一看，回道：“妆蟒洒堆、刻丝弹墨并各色绸绫大小幔子一百二十架，昨日得了八十架，下欠四十架。帘子二百挂，昨日俱得了。外有猩猩毡帘二百挂，湘妃竹帘一百挂，金丝藤红漆竹帘一百挂，黑漆竹帘一百挂，五彩线络盘花帘二百挂，每样得了一半，也不过秋天都全了。椅搭、桌围、床裙、机套，每分一千二百件，也有了。”\n　　一面说，一面走，忽见青山斜阻。转过山怀中，隐隐露出一带黄泥墙，墙上皆用稻茎掩护。有几百枝杏花，如喷火蒸霞一般。里面数楹茅屋，外面却是桑、榆、槿、柘各色树稚新条，随其曲折，编就两溜青篱。篱外山坡之下，有一土井，旁有桔槔辘轳之属；下面分畦列亩，佳蔬菜花，一望无际。贾政笑道：“倒是此处有些道理。虽系人力穿凿，却入目动心，未免勾引起我归农之意。我们且进去歇息歇息。”说毕，方欲进去，忽见篱门外路旁有一石，亦为留题之所。众人笑道：“更妙，更妙！此处若悬匾待题，则田舍家风一洗尽矣。立此一竭，又觉许多生色，非范石湖田家之咏不足以尽其妙。”贾政道：“诸公请题。”众人云：“方才世兄云：‘编新不如述旧。’此处古人已道尽矣：莫若直书‘杏花村’为妙。”贾政听了，笑向贾珍道：“正亏提醒了我。此处都好，只是还少一个酒幌，明日竟做一个来，就依外面村庄的式样，不必华丽，用竹竿挑在树梢头。”贾珍答应了，又回道：“此处竟不必养别样雀鸟，只养些鹅、鸭、鸡之类，才相称。”贾政与众人都说好。\n　　贾政又向众人道：“‘杏花村’固佳，只是犯了正村名，直待请名方可。”众客都道：“是呀！如今虚的，却是何字样好呢？”大家正想，宝玉却等不得了，也不等贾政的话，便说道：“旧诗云：‘红杏梢头挂酒旗。’如今莫若且题以‘杏帘在望’四字。”众人都道：“好个‘在望’！又暗合‘杏花村’意思。”宝玉冷笑道：“村若用‘杏花’二字，便俗陋不堪了。唐人诗里，还有‘柴门临水稻花香’，何不用‘稻香村’的妙？”众人听了，越发同声拍手道妙。贾政一声断喝：“无知的畜生！你能知道几个古人，能记得几首旧诗，敢在老先生们跟前卖弄！方才任你胡说，也不过试你的清浊，取笑而已，你就认真了！”\n　　说着，引众人步入茆堂，里面纸窗木榻，富贵气象一洗皆尽。贾政心中自是欢喜，却瞅宝玉道：“此处如何？”众人见问，都忙悄悄的推宝玉教他说好。宝玉不听人言，便应声道：“不及‘有凤来仪’多了。”贾政听了道：“咳！无知的蠢物，你只知朱楼画栋、恶赖富丽为佳，那里知道这清幽气象呢！终是不读书之过。”宝玉忙答道：“老爷教训的固是，但古人云‘天然’二字，不知何意？”众人见宝玉牛心，都怕他讨了没趣；今见问“天然”二字，众人忙道：“哥儿别的都明白，如何‘天然’反要问呢？天然者，天之自成，不是人力之所为的。”宝玉道：“却又来！此处置一田庄，分明是人力造作成的。远无邻村，近不负郭，背山无脉，临水无源，高无隐寺之塔，下无通市之桥，峭然孤出，似非大观，那及前数处有自然之理、自然之趣呢？虽种竹引泉，亦不伤穿凿。古人云‘天然图画’四字，正恐非其地而强为其地，非其山而强为其山，即百般精巧，终不相宜……”未及说完，贾政气的喝命：“出去！”才出去，又喝命：“回来！”命：“再题一联，若不通，一并打嘴巴！”宝玉吓的战兢兢的，半日，只得念道：\n　　　　新绿涨添浣葛处，好云香护采芹人。\n　　贾政听了，摇头道：“更不好。”一面引人出来，转过山坡，穿花度柳，抚石依泉，过了荼蘼茂架，入木香棚，越牡丹亭，度芍药圃，到蔷薇院，傍芭蕉坞里盘旋曲折。忽闻水声潺潺，出于石洞；上则萝薜倒垂，下则落花浮荡。众人都道：“好景，好景！”贾政道：“诸公题以何名？”众人道：“再不必拟了，恰恰乎是‘武陵源’三字。”贾政笑道：“又落实了，而且陈旧。”众人笑道：“不然就用‘秦人旧舍’四字也罢。”宝玉道：“越发背谬了。‘秦人旧舍’是避乱之意，如何使得？莫若‘蓼汀花溆’四字。”贾政听了道：“更是胡说。”\n　　于是贾政进了港洞，又问贾珍：“有船无船？”贾珍道：“采莲船共四只，座船一只，如今尚未造成。”贾政笑道：“可惜不得入了！”贾珍道：“从山上盘道也可以进去的。”说毕，在前导引，大家攀藤抚树过去。只见水上落花愈多，其水愈加清溜，溶溶荡荡，曲折萦纡。池边两行垂柳，杂以桃杏遮天，无一些尘土。忽见柳阴中又露出一个折带朱栏板桥来，度过桥去，诸路可通，便见一所清凉瓦舍，一色水磨砖墙，清瓦花堵。那大主山所分之脉皆穿墙而过。贾政道：“此处这一所房子，无味的很。”因而步入门时，忽迎面突出插天的大玲珑山石来，四面群绕各式石块，竟把里面所有房屋悉皆遮住。且一树花木也无，只见许多异草，或有牵藤的，或有引蔓的，或垂山岭，或穿石脚，甚至垂檐绕柱，萦砌盘阶，或如翠带飘摇，或如金绳蟠屈，或实若丹砂，或花如金桂，味香气馥，非凡花之可比。贾政不禁道：“有趣！只是不大认识。”有的说：“是薜荔藤萝。”贾政道：“薜藤萝那得有此异香？”宝玉道：“果然不是。这众草中也有藤萝薛荔。那香的是杜若蘅芜，那一种大约是兰，这一种大约是金葛，那一种是金草，这一种是玉藤，红的自然是紫芸，绿的定是青芷。想来那《离骚》、《文选》所有的那些异草：有叫作什么霍纳姜汇的，也有叫作什么纶组紫绎的。还有什么石帆、清松、抚留等样的，见于左太冲《吴都赋》。又有叫作什么绿荑的，还有什么丹椒、蘑芜、风莲，见于《蜀都赋》。如今年深岁改，人不能识，故皆象形夺名，渐渐的唤差了，也是有的。”未及说完，贾政喝道：“谁问你来？”唬的宝玉倒退，不敢再说。\n　　贾政因见两边俱是超手游廊，便顺着游廊步入，只见上面五间清厦，连着卷棚，四面出廓，绿窗油壁，更比前清雅不同。贾政叹道：“此轩中煮茗操琴，也不必再焚香了。此造却出意外，诸公必有佳作新题以颜其额，方不负此。”众人笑道：“莫若‘兰风蕙露’贴切了。”贾政道：“也只好用这四字。其联云何？”一人道：“我想了一对，大家批削改正。道是：‘麝兰芳霭斜阳院，杜若香飘明月洲。’”众人道：“妙则妙矣！只是‘斜阳’二字不妥。那人引古诗“蘼芜满院泣斜阳”句，众人云：“颓丧，颓丧！”又一人道：“我也有一联，诸公评阅评阅。”道：“三径香风飘玉蕙，一庭明月照金兰。”贾政拈须沉吟，意欲也题一联。忽抬头见宝玉在旁不敢作声，因喝道：“怎么你应说话时又不说了？还要等人请教你不成？”宝玉听了回道：“此处并没有什么‘兰麝’，‘明月’、‘洲渚’之类，若要这样着迹说来，就题二百联也不能完。”贾政道：“谁按着你的头，教你必定说这些字样呢？”宝玉道：“如此说，则匾上莫若‘蘅芷清芬’四字。对联则是：“吟成豆蔻诗犹艳，睡足荼蘼梦亦香。”贾政笑道：“这是套的‘书成蕉叶文犹绿’，不足为奇。”众人道：“李太白‘凤凰台’之作，全套‘黄鹤楼’。只要套得妙。如今细评起来，方才一联竟比‘书成蕉叶’尤觉幽雅活动。”贾政笑道：“岂有此理。”\n　　说着，大家出来。走不多远，则见崇阁巍峨，层楼高起，面面琳宫合抱，迢迢复道萦纡。青松拂檐，玉兰绕砌；金辉兽面，彩焕螭头。贾政道：“这是正殿了。只是太富丽了些。”众人都道：“要如此方是。虽然贵妃崇尚节俭，然今日之尊，礼仪如此，不为过也。”一面说，一面走，只见正面现出一座玉石牌坊，上面龙蟠螭护，玲拢凿就。贾政道：“此处书以何文？”众人道：“必是‘蓬莱仙境’方妙。”贾政摇头不语。宝玉见了这个所在，心中忽有所动，寻思起来，倒象在那里见过的一般，却一时想不起那年那日的事了。贾政又命他题咏，宝玉只顾细思前景，全无心于此了。众人不知其意，只当他受了这半日折磨，精神耗散，才尽词穷了，再要作难逼迫着了急，或生出事来，倒不便。遂忙都劝贾政道：“罢了，明日再题罢了。”贾政心中也怕贾母不放心，遂冷笑道：“你这畜生，也竟有不能之时了。也罢，限你一日，明日题不来，定不饶你。这是第一要紧处所，要好生作来。”\n　　说着，引人出来，再一观望，原来自进门至此，才游了十之五六。又值人来回，有雨村处遣人回话。贾政笑道：“此数处不能游了。虽如此，到底从那一边出去，也可略观大概。“说着，引客行来，至一大桥，水如晶帘一般奔入。原来这桥边是通外河之闸，引泉而入者。贾政因问：“此闸何名？”宝玉道：“此乃沁芳源之正流，即名‘沁芳闸’。”贾政道：“胡说，偏不用‘沁芳’二字。”\n　　于是一路行来，或清堂，或茅舍，或堆石为垣，或编花为门，或山下得幽尼佛寺，或林中藏女道丹房，或长廊曲洞，或方厦圆亭，贾政皆不及进去。因半日未尝歇息，腿酸脚软，忽又见前面露出一所院落来，贾政道：“到此可要歇息歇息了。”说着一径引入，绕着碧桃花，穿过竹篱花障编就的月洞门，俄见粉垣环护，绿柳周垂。贾政与众人进了门，西边尽是游廊相接，院中点衬几块山石，一边种几本芭蕉，那一边是一树西府海棠，其势若伞，丝垂金缕，葩吐丹砂。众人都道：“好花，好花！海棠也有，从没见过这样好的。”贾政道：“这叫做‘女儿棠’，乃是外国之种，俗传出‘女儿国’，故花最繁盛，——亦荒唐不经之说耳。”众人道：“毕竟此花不同，‘女国’之说，想亦有之。”宝玉云：“大约骚人咏士以此花红若施脂，弱如扶病，近乎闺阁风度，故以‘女儿’命名。世人以讹传讹，都未免认真了。”众人都说：“领教，妙解！”一面说话．一面都在廊下榻上坐了。贾政因道：“想几个什么新鲜字来题？”一客道：“‘蕉鹤’二字妙。”又一个道：“‘崇光泛彩’方妙。”贾政与众人都道：“好个‘崇光泛彩’！”宝玉也道：“妙。”又说：“只是可惜了！”众人问：“如何可惜？”宝玉道：“此处蕉棠两植，其意暗蓄‘红’‘绿’二字在内，若说一样，遗漏一样，便不足取。”贾政道：“依你如何？”宝玉道：“依我，题‘红香绿玉’四字，方两全其美。”贾政摇头道：“不好，不好！”\n　　说着，引人进入房内。只见其中收拾的与别处不同，竟分不出间隔来。原来四面皆是雕空玲珑木板，或“流云百蝠”，或“岁寒三友”，或山水人物，或翎毛花卉，或集锦，或博古，或万福万寿，各种花样，皆是名手雕镂五彩，销金嵌玉的。一格一格，或贮书，或设鼎，或安置笔砚，或供设瓶花，或安放盆景。其格式样或圆或方，或葵花蕉叶，或连环半壁，真是花团锦簇，剔透玲戏。倏尔五色纱糊，竟系小窗；倏尔彩绫轻覆，竟系幽户。且满墙皆是随依古董玩器之形抠成的槽于，如琴、剑、悬瓶之类，俱悬于壁，却都是与壁相平的。众人都赞：“好精致！难为怎么做的！”原来贾政走进来了，未到两层，便都迷了旧路，左瞧也有门可通，右瞧也有窗隔断，及到跟前，又被一架书档住，回头又有窗纱明透门径。及至门前，忽见迎面也进来了一起人，与自己的形相一样，却是一架大玻璃镜。转过镜去，一发见门多了。贾珍笑道：“老爷随我来，从这里出去就是后院，出了后院倒比先近了。”引着贾政及众人转了两层纱厨，果得一门出去，院中满架蔷薇。转过花障，只见青溪前阻。众人诧异：“这水又从何而来？”贾珍遥指道：“原从那闸起流至洞口，从东北山凹里引到那村庄里，又开一道岔口，引至西南上，共总流到这里，仍旧合在一处，从那墙下出去。”众人听了，都道：“神妙之极！”说着，忽见大山阻路，众人都迷了路，贾珍笑道：“跟我来。”乃在前导引，众人随着，由山脚下一转，便是平担大路，豁然大门现于面前，众人都道：“有趣，有趣！搜神夺巧，至于此极！”于是大家出来。\n　　那宝玉一心只记挂着里边姊妹们，又不见贾政吩咐，只得跟到书房。贾政忽想起来道：“你还不去，看老太太惦记你。难道还逛不足么？”宝玉方退了出来。至院外，就有跟贾政的小厮上来抱住，说道：“今日亏了老爷喜欢，方才老太太打发人出来问了几遍，我们回说老爷喜欢；要不然，老太太叫你进去了，就不得展才了。人人都说你才那些诗比众人都强，今儿得了彩头，该赏我们了。”宝玉笑道：“每人一吊。”众人道：“谁没见那一吊钱！把这荷包赏了罢。”说着，一个个都上来解荷包，解扇袋，不容分说，将宝玉所佩之物，尽行解去。又道：“好生送上去罢。”一个个围绕着，送至贾母门前。那时贾母正等着他，见他来了，知道不曾难为他，心中自是喜欢。\n　　少时袭人倒了茶来，见身边佩物一件不存，因笑道：“带的东西又是那起没脸的东西们解了去了。”黛玉听说，走过来一瞧，果然一件没有，因向宝玉道：“我给你的那个荷包也给他们了？你明儿再想我的东西，可不能够了！”说毕，生气回房，将前日宝玉嘱咐他没做完的香袋儿，拿起剪子来就铰。宝玉见他生气，便忙赶过来，早已剪破了。宝玉曾见过这香袋，虽未完工，却十分精巧，无故剪了，却也可气。因忙把衣领解了，从里面衣襟上将所系荷包解下来了递与黛玉道：“你瞧瞧，这是什么东西？我何从把你的东西给人来着？”黛玉见他如此珍重，带在里面，可知是怕人拿去之意，因此自悔莽撞剪了香袋，低着头一言不发。宝玉道：“你也不用铰，我知你是懒怠给我东西。我连这个荷包奉还何如？”说着掷向他怀中而去。黛玉越发气的哭了，拿起荷包又铰。宝玉忙回身抢住，笑道：“好妹妹饶了他罢！”黛玉将剪子一摔，拭泪说道：“你不用合我好一阵歹一阵的，要恼就撂开手。”说着赌气上床，面向里倒下拭泪。禁不住宝玉上来“妹妹”长“妹妹”短赔不是。\n　　前面贾母一片声找宝玉。众人回说：“在林姑娘房里。”贾母听说道：“好，好！让他姐妹们一处玩玩儿罢。才他老子拘了他这半天，让他松泛一会子罢。只别叫他们拌嘴。”众人答应着。\n　　黛玉被宝玉缠不过，只得起来道：“你的意思不叫我安生，我就离了你。”说着往外就走。宝玉笑道：“你到那里我跟到那里。”一面仍拿着荷包来带上。黛玉伸手抢道：“你说不要，这会子又带上，我也替你怪臊的！”说着“嗤”的一声笑了。宝玉道：“好妹妹，明儿另替我做个香袋儿罢！”黛玉道：“那也瞧我的高兴罢了。”一面说，一面二人出房，到王夫人上房中去了。可巧宝钗也在那里。\n　　此时王夫人那边热闹非常。原来贾蔷已从姑苏采买了十二个女孩子、并聘了教习以及行头等事来了。那时薛姨妈另于东北上一所幽静房舍居住，将梨香院另行修理了，就令教习在此教演女戏。又另派了家中旧曾学过歌唱的众女人们，如今皆是皤然老妪，着他们带领管理。其日月出入银钱等事，以及诸凡大小需之物料账目，就令贾蔷总理。\n又有林之孝来回：“采访聘买得十二个小尼姑、小道姑，都到了。连新做的二十分道袍也有了。外又有一个带发修行的，本是苏州人氏，祖上也是读书仕宦之家，因自幼多病，买了许多替身，皆不中用，到底这姑娘入了空门，方才好了，所以带发修行。今年十八岁，取名妙玉。如今父母俱已亡故，身边只有两个老嫂嫂、一个小丫头伏侍，文墨也极通，经典也极熟，模样又极好。因听说长安都中有观音遗迹并贝叶遗文，去年随了师父上来，现在西门外牟尼院住着。他师父精演先天神数，于去冬圆寂了。遗言说他：‘不宜回乡，在此静候，自有结果。’所以未曾扶灵回去。”王夫人便道：“这样我们何不接了他来？”林之孝家的回道：“若请他，他说：‘候门公府，必以贵势压人，我再不去的。’”王夫人道：“他既是宦家小姐，自然要性傲些。就下个请贴请他何妨。”林之孝家的答应着出去，叫书启相公写个请贴去请妙玉，次日遣人备车轿去接。\n不知后来如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Qin Zhong’s death Baoyu wept incessantly until the others finally succeeded in comforting him, but he remained grief-stricken on his return. The Lady Dowager contributed several dozen taels towards the funeral, and Baoyu went to offer a libation. A week later the funeral took place, but no details need be given here.\n\nBaoyu mourned for his friend day after day, unable to dismiss him from his thoughts. However, there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nOne day Jia Zhen and his companions came to report to Jia Zheng, “The work on the garden is finished. Lord She has already inspected it. It only remains for you, sir, to go and see it. If there is anything amiss, we can have it changed before the inscriptions are chosen.”\n\nAfter some reflection Jia Zheng observed, “These inscriptions are going to be a problem. According to etiquette, we should wait for the Imperial Consort to do us the honour of composing them. But she can hardly do that without seeing the place. And if we wait until she comes to visit it before asking her, with so many vistas and lodges and so much scenery, without some inscriptions it will lack all character.”\n\n“Your point is well taken, sir,” agreed the secretaries who were present. “But we have an idea. Inscriptions are indispensable, yet they can’t be decided upon in advance. Why not prepare some temporary ones to suit the different spots — two or three words for each, even four would do — to be hung on the lanterns when Her Highness comes. We can ask her then to decide on the permanent names. Wouldn’t that be two ways at once?”\n\n“That seems a good idea,” said Jia Zheng. “Let us go and have a look today. We can think up some inscriptions. If they are suitable, we can keep them. If not, we can ask Jia Yucun to suggest others.”\n\n“You are sure to think of excellent ones today, sir,” they replied. “Why need you trouble to consult Yucun?”\n\n“You don’t understand,” Jia Zheng said with a smile. “I was never much good even as a boy at writing verses about flowers, birds and scenery; and now that I am older and burdened with official duties I have even less flair for such things. Any attempts of mine would be so pedantic and dull that they would quite spoil the effect of the grounds and make myself ridiculous.”\n\n“That doesn’t matter,” they countered. “We can all try. Each can write what he is best at. We can choose the good lines and reject the bad. That should be all right.”\n\n“That seems a good idea too. And as the weather is so pleasant today, let’s all go and have a look.”\n\nSo he stood up and led the way and the others followed. Jia Zhen went ahead to warn those in the garden.\n\nNow Baoyu had been plunged into depression by his grief for Qin Zhong, and the Lady Dowager, to cheer him up, had ordered him to be taken to the new garden to play. He had just gone in when in came Jia Zhen.\n\n“Hurry up and get out,” said the latter with a smile. “The master will be here any minute.”\n\nAt that Baoyu rushed out with his nurse and pages, but no sooner had he turned a corner than he ran head on into Jia Zheng and his party. Since there was no way to escape, he simply stood waiting by the side of the path.\n\nOf late Jia Zheng had heard his tutor praise Baoyu for his quickness at composing couplets, remarking that although the boy was not studious he showed considerable originality. So Jia Zheng wanted to put him to the test today and ordered him to accompany them into the garden. Baoyu, not knowing what his father had in mind, had to comply.\n\nAs soon as they entered the garden gate they found Jia Zhen with a group of stewards standing waiting beside it. Jia Zheng ordered the gate closed and they first inspected the outside.\n\nIt was a five-section gate-tower with a hump-backed roof of half-cylindrical tiles. The lintels, doors and latticework were finely carved with novel designs and left unpainted. The whitewashed walls and white marble steps were engraved with Western floral designs. To right and left were snow-white powder-silkworm walls with chequered patterns of black tiles below. This all struck Jia Zheng as pleasingly quiet and tasteful. He ordered the gate opened and they went in.\n\nA green hill loomed immediately before them.\n\n“Without this hill,” observed Jia Zheng, “the whole garden would be visible as one entered, and how tame that would be!”\n\n\"Quite so,\" they agreed. \"Unless one had great breadth of vision, this wouldn't be much of a pleasure.\"\n\nAs they spoke they looked ahead at white rocks resembling monsters or beasts, lying or crouching in a horizontal or vertical position. On them grew green moss and creepers which half screened a narrow path.\n\n\"Now we'll follow this path,\" proposed Jia Zheng. \"On our way back we can leave by the other side and that way we shall have seen the whole place.\"\n\nSo he made Jia Zhen lead the way while he leaned on Baoyu's shoulder and followed slowly through the entrance between the hills. Looking up suddenly, they saw a white rock polished smooth as a mirror, obviously intended for an inscription to be the first thing to catch the eye.\n\n\"What would be a good name for this, gentlemen?\" asked Jia Zheng, turning with a smile.\n\nThe literary men suggested such names as \"Embroidered Ridge\" and \"Crested Emerald,\" \"Embroidery Screen,\" \"Little Incense Burner\" or \"Miniature Mount Zhongnan,\" offering some dozen in all.\n\nKnowing that Jia Zheng meant to test Baoyu, however, they did not go to much trouble but made a few perfunctory suggestions, as was guessed by Baoyu too. When Jia Zheng told him to propose a name, Baoyu said:\n\n\"I remember an old saying: 'Rather than invent, quote; and to carve in ancient style is better than to fashion something new.' As this isn't the main prominence or one of the chief sights, it only needs an inscription because it's the first step into the garden. So why not use the old line 'a winding path leads to a secluded retreat'? That would be apt and tasteful too.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" cried the others. \"Our young brother is a genius, far more brilliant than dull pedants like ourselves.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter the boy,\" protested Jia Zheng with a smile. \"He's just making a ridiculous parade of his very limited knowledge. We can think of a better name later.\"\n\nThey entered a cave where they saw beautiful trees, rare flowers and a clear stream, tumbling down through bamboos and flowers to flow beneath the rocks. A few steps further north the way grew level and wide and they could see stately buildings with elegant pavilions, fine galleries and loggias, half hidden in a fold of the hill and embowered in trees. Looking down, they saw a crystal stream cascading like jade and a stone bridge with posts of white marble carved with beasts' heads. On the bridge was a pavilion, and in this Jia Zheng sat down with the rest.\n\n\"What would you call this?\" he asked.\n\nOne said, \"Ouyang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of 'a winged pavilion.' 'Winged Pavilion' would be a good name.\"\n\n\"'Winged Pavilion' is good,\" rejoined Jia Zheng, \"but since this pavilion is built over the water it should have a name to suggest water. Ouyang Xiu has the line, 'Erect between two streams, it looks like a winged pavilion.' But while 'winged' is appropriate, the single word 'stream' in that line doesn't suit this spot. I suggest borrowing the word 'overflow' from another passage: 'The overflow from the Brewer's Spring....' What could we call it then?\"\n\n\"Overflowing Jade!\" cried one of them.\n\nJia Zheng tugged at his whiskers in thought, then asked Baoyu to propose a name.\n\n\"You said just now that 'a winding path leads to a secluded retreat,'\" he reminded him. \"But though we may quote, we should also allude to the source. As this is built for the Imperial Consort's visit home, it would be more appropriate to use an allusion from some classic written on an imperial occasion, to avoid any suggestion of vulgarity. Don't you think 'overflow' is rather coarse? The only thing is to find a more refined word. And if you insist on the line about the Brewer's Spring, would 'Fragrant Rill' be better? But I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"What do you think of this argument, gentlemen?\" Jia Zheng asked with a chuckle. \"When we wanted something new just now, our young friend maintained that we should quote instead. And now that we are quoting, he finds it coarse. What have you to say for yourself now?\"\n\n\"Those two words are not as good as 'Seeping Fragrance,'\" replied Baoyu.\n\nJia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded in silence, while the rest were loud in their praise.\n\n\"All right for the tablet,\" said Jia Zheng. \"Now what about the couplet?\"\n\nLooking round, Baoyu thought quickly and then declaimed:\n\n\"Willows on the dyke lend their verdancy to three punts;\n\nFlowers on the further shore spare a breath of fragrance.\"\n\nAfter hearing this Jia Zheng smiled and nodded. The rest of the party added their praises.\n\nThen, leaving the pavilion, they crossed a bridge and gazed with interest at each rivulet, rock, plant and tree. Suddenly looking up, they saw a whitewashed wall enclosing elegant buildings nestling at the foot of a green hill, their eaves peeping through the thick foliage of bamboos which screened them.\n\n“A delightful spot!” was the general verdict.\n\nEntering the gate they found a covered walk winding through bamboos, whose green shadows cast a coolness even in summer, while a paved path led to a little cottage of three rooms, two of them bright and one dark. The tables, chairs and couches inside were made to fit the dimensions of the rooms. A small door in the inner room opened into a back garden gay with pear blossom and broad-leaved plantains, in front of which were two tiny retreats. A spring flowed through a breach in the garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran through the grounds, skirted the steps and houses, then wound past the bamboos of the forecourt before disappearing through another breach.\n\n“What a charming idea!” exclaimed Jia Zheng. “If one could sit and read by this window on a moonlit night, one would not have lived in vain.”\n\nHe was looking at Baoyu as he spoke, which so flustered the boy that he hung his head. The rest of the party hastily changed the subject and two of them asked:\n\n“What four characters should be inscribed on the board here?”\n\n“What would you suggest?” countered Jia Zheng.\n\nOne of them proposed: “A Riverside Retreat.”\n\n“Commonplace,” declared Jia Zheng.\n\nThe other suggested: “The Home of an Ancient Hermit.”\n\n“That’s even more commonplace.”\n\n“Suppose you suggest something, Cousin Bao,” said Jia Zhen who was standing by.\n\n“He hasn’t earned the right yet,” objected Jia Zheng. “He’s still young. All he can do is to criticize his elders — the young rascal.”\n\n“You can’t blame him for that, sir,” they demurred. “So why not let him try?”\n\n“Don’t imagine I’m going to indulge him,” said Jia Zheng. “I’ll let him have his say today, but not make any decision until we’ve discussed it. If he talks sense, well and good. If not, I’ll box his ears and send him packing.” He turned to Baoyu. “Well, what have you to say? What would be good?”\n\n“None of the suggestions just made seems to me appropriate,” replied Baoyu.\n\nJia Zheng smiled scornfully. “How so?”\n\n“As this is the first place the Imperial Consort will visit on her tour, we should have an inscription which conveys something of His Majesty’s favour. If we must use a four-character inscription, wouldn’t it be better to have something original instead of a cliche?”\n\n“Aren’t ‘Riverside’ and ‘Hermitage’ allusions to the classics?”\n\n“Yes, but they’re too hackneyed. I suggest ‘Where the Phoenix Alights.’”\n\nA chorus of approval went up from the whole group.\n\n“You young beast...” Jia Zheng nodded and sighed. “It’s a pity you’ve made no effort to acquire a little learning but just pick up what you can by hearsay. Still, this isn’t too bad.” He turned to the others. “Let’s go on.”\n\nHe was leading the way out when suddenly thinking of something he asked Jia Zhen, “Are all the furnishings in these buildings and courtyards ready?”\n\n“We’ve stocked them with nearly all we need,” was the reply. “We’ll make good any omissions later. As for the curtains, blinds and screens, Jia Lian told me yesterday that we’re still short of quite a number, but we’ve given the measurements to the tailors and we got half of them only yesterday.”\n\nRealizing that his nephew was not in charge of this, Jia Zheng sent to summon Jia Lian, who soon appeared and was asked, “How many of each sort are needed? How many have been made? How many are still missing?”\n\nJia Lian extracted a list from his boot and read out: “Yesterday we got eighty of the one hundred and twenty large and small curtains of satin with serpent designs, brocade and figured gauze, embroidered or plain. That leaves forty still to come. We have all the two hundred portieres. Of the two hundred red felt portieres, we have a hundred and twenty. The hundred blinds of Xiangfei bamboo and the hundred of rattan painted red with gold are all ready....”\n\nOne hundred of black lacquered bamboo blinds, one hundred of flower-patterned curtains to be hung on racks — we’ve half of all these already and should have the full number by the autumn. As for chair-covers, table-drapes, valances and stool-cushions, we’ve twelve hundred of each.”\n\nTalking as they strolled on, they suddenly noticed a green hill barring their way. Skirting it they glimpsed a faintly discernible straw-thatched cot with a surrounding adobe wall. The wall, however, was not of brick but of pounded earth faced with straw and lime and finished with a coping of rice-stalks. Several hundred apricot trees in bloom, brilliant as flaming clouds, were enclosed by this wall. In their midst stood a thatched cottage. Outside grew saplings of mulberry, elm, hibiscus and silkwormthorn twined into a green hedge. Below the slope beyond this hedge was a well, beside it a windlass and a stand for irrigating the fields. Below again were plots of vegetables and flowers, stretching as far as the eye could see.\n\n“I must say this is pleasing,” remarked Jia Zheng. “Though artificially made, it strikes me as the work of nature and makes me long for a country retreat. Let us go in and rest a while.”\n\nAs he was about to enter the wicket-gate, he noticed a stone by the path outside, obviously intended for an inscription.\n\n“Excellent!” cried the others. “If a tablet were hung up here, the cottage would lose all its rustic charm. This stone has been put here for an inscription. We must find an apt name for this place.”\n\n“What would you suggest, gentlemen?” asked Jia Zheng.\n\n“As your son observed just now, ‘To devise is not as good as to recall.’” Though many old poems have the line ‘An apricot village invites,’ that is too obvious. Why not use the ancient name ‘Apricot Village’?”\n\nJia Zheng turned with a smile to Jia Zhen, saying, “That reminds me. This place is perfect in every way, but it still lacks a tavern-sign. You must have one made tomorrow. It needn’t be elaborate, just an ordinary village sign. Hang it from a bamboo pole on a tree-top.”\n\nJia Zhen promised to see to this and added, “Other birds wouldn’t be in keeping here, but we should keep some geese, ducks, hens and so on.”\n\nJia Zheng and the rest approved.\n\n“The name ‘Apricot Village’ is first-rate,” observed Jia Zheng. “But since it’s the name of a real place we should have to ask permission to use it.”\n\n“That’s right,” said the others. “And since we can’t do that, what other name could we use?”\n\nAs they were thinking, Baoyu, not waiting for his father’s permission, blurted out, “An old poem has the line: ‘Above the apricot blooms a tavern sign appears.’ Why not call this ‘Approach to Apricot Tavern’?”\n\n“Good!” cried the others. “‘Approach’ suggests ‘in sight’ and fits in with the idea of the ‘Apricot Village.’”\n\n“No, it’s vulgar.” Baoyu shook his head scornfully. “The word ‘apricot’ is too obvious. What about another line from the Tang poets: ‘By the wattled gate the scent of paddy smiles’? Why not call it ‘Paddy-Sweet Cottage’?”\n\nThe whole party clapped in admiration. But Jia Zheng interrupted them with a snort.\n\n“You ignorant idiot!” he fumed. “How many old poets do you know, and how many ancient poems have you read that you dare to show off in front of your elders? I let you have your say just now to test your intelligence and for a little fun — and you’ve proved yourself a conceited fool.”\n\nSo saying he led the party in, and the sight of the papered windows and wooden couches inside banished all thoughts of ostentation or luxury. Jia Zheng was inwardly pleased but, looking round at Baoyu, he demanded:\n\n“What do you think of this place?”\n\nHis companions nudged the boy to induce him to approve. But ignoring them he answered, “It’s not as fine as ‘Where the Phoenix Alights.’”\n\n“Ignorant dolt!” exclaimed his father. “All you care for are red pavilions and carved beams — with your vulgar, misbegotten preference for luxury. How can you appreciate the quiet charm of a place like this? This comes of neglecting your studies.”\n\n“Of course you’re right, sir,” Baoyu agreed promptly. “But I’ve always wondered what was meant by ‘natural.’ Will you explain?”\n\nHis father was furious. “You stable-boy! Are you trying to catch me out? ‘Natural’ means that which is made by Nature, not by man.”\n\n“There you are!” Baoyu chuckled. “A farmstead of this sort is bound to be in the country or in a mountain valley, some place far from the noisy, crowded town. It should have a range of hills nearby, no other houses in sight, and be near water at the foot of a slope; then all the fruits and flowers will grow of themselves. The bamboos in front and behind should not be planted but grow there naturally. That way, those who come from the city, however uncouth, will at once be struck by its natural beauty which will take them unawares and make them feel as if they had strayed into a fairyland. But look at this place. First of all, you’ve just come on this artificial hill, then on this artificial embankment. But instead of having a stream to hide the entrance, the place is wide open. Though there are hundreds of apricot trees, they’re so badly arranged that they look artificial — as if put there for show. What is less natural is the absence of any sound of birds. But if you were to set a few hens, ducks or geese in this place, it would seem more natural. As Li Shangyin wrote:\n\n‘The natural landscape for a thatched cot:\nThe fowls are cackling, the cocks crow at noon.’\n\n“We’ve been talking about ‘naturalness’ all this time, but this place is so far from natural that it’s more artificial than the ‘Phoenix’ part. It’s what the ancients called ‘forced and far-fetched.’”\n\nBefore he could finish Jia Zheng exploded.\n\n“Take that wretched boy out of here!” he bellowed.\n\n“Yes sir.” And Baoyu fled.\n\n“Come back!” shouted his father. “Write a couplet for this place. If it’s no good, I’ll box your ears.”\n\nBaoyu had to turn back. With hanging head he suggested:\n\n“The scent of paddy wafts over the abundant crop;\nSweet the flowers in the village beyond.”\n“That’s even worse,” snorted his father, shaking his head as the others remarked:\n\n“He’s not at his best today. This couplet isn’t up to the one he made just now.”\n\n“Don’t be hard on him,” they urged. “He’s only a child.”\n\nBut Jia Zheng retorted, “I’m not being hard on him. He’ll never do well in the examinations, and that doesn’t matter so much. But he can’t even turn out a commonplace couplet — all he has is a certain glibness.”\n\n“That’s not fair,” protested the others. “You’re too hard on him. Although he’s young, he shows remarkable talent. It’s only because he’s over-awed by you that he can’t do himself justice. If you encourage him, he’ll do better.”\n\n“I don’t agree,” said Jia Zheng. “He should be spurred, not encouraged. But you’re all related to me, so you’re biased.”\n\nHe then ordered his men to take Baoyu out, and the boy, once outside the gate, made off like a streak of smoke, grumbling and grimacing at the servants who had been holding him.\n\n\"What is meant by 'nature'? What is natural is so by the will of Heaven and cannot be contrived by man.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" cried Pao-yu. \"A farm here is obviously man-made. It has no village in the distance, no fields near by, no mountain range behind, no source for the stream at hand. Above, no pagoda shelters it; below, no bridge leads to a market. Steep and isolated, it lacks the grandeur you find in larger views. It can't compare with those other places which had natural charm. The bamboos and stream here don't look out of place, I admit. But when the ancients spoke of 'a natural painting,' they meant that what was forced and artificial would never do, however fine, if the place wasn't suited to it....\"\n\nBefore he could finish, his father angrily cut him short. \"Get out!\" he ordered.\n\nAs Pao-yu was slinking off, Chin Cheng barked, \"Come back!\"\n\nHe then commanded, \"Make up another couplet. If it's poor, you'll get a slap on the mouth too.\"\n\nPao-yu had to comply. Trembling, he presently recited:\n\n\"The green tide fills the creek where clothes are washed;\n\nClouds of fragrance surround the girls plucking watercress.\"\n\nChin Cheng shook his head. \"Still worse.\" He led the party out then, and they made their way past the slope, through flowers and willows, along the rocks and by the stream. They passed trellises laden with roseleaf raspberry, entered a wood-oil shed, crossed the peony pavilion and the white peony plot, then wound their way through the court where roses grew till they came to a banana grove. Turning, they heard the gurgle of a stream from a grotto, festooned with creepers, from which blossoms dropped to float on the water.\n\n\"What a delightful spot!\" they cried.\n\n\"What would you call it, gentlemen?\" asked Chin Cheng.\n\n\"No need to hesitate,\" they said. \"The very thing is 'The Haven of the Peach Blossoms.'\"\n\nChin Cheng smiled. \"Too hackneyed. And too obvious.\"\n\n\"In that case, what about 'The Qin People's Old Retreat'?\"\n\n\"That's even more impossible,\" objected Pao-yu. \"The Qin people retreated here to escape from the world. How can you give that name to a place which isn't cut off from the outside? I suggest 'Smartweed Bank and Flowery Harbour.'\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Chin Cheng snorted.\n\nHe led the way into the cavern, which was spanned by a stone bridge and had a pavilion over it.\n\n\"What would you call this, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Ou Yangxiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of 'a winged pavilion on the bridge,'\" one of them recalled. \"What could be better than 'Pavilion on the Bridge'?\"\n\n\"That 'Pavilion on the Bridge' is only a name for a bridge, not a real pavilion,\" objected Chin Cheng. \"This won't do.\"\n\nHe looked at Pao-yu.\n\n\"Your father is right,\" put in the others. \"Still, Pao-yu may have some better idea. Let's hear what he suggests.\"\n\n\"I've read in some old poem, 'An overhead bridge separates the pines,'\" said Pao-yu. \"Why not use the name 'Separated-Pines Bridge'? That would sound original.\"\n\n\"Let's drop the subject,\" said his father. \"Just give us a couplet now.\"\n\nPao-yu thought for a while, then recited:\n\n\"An overhead bridge tempts one to pick the stars;\n\nAcross the winding river float the petals.\"\n\nChin Cheng merely stroked his beard in silence as the rest exclaimed with one voice, \"Excellent!\"\n\nThey now left the cave and strolled on for a little until they came in sight of a spacious courtyard fronted by a plain wall and surrounded on all sides by green hills. In contrast to the other buildings, this one had no pavilions or winding corridors but only a few halls where one could take shelter from the wind and rain. It was entirely surrounded by other buildings, to which it was linked by passages above and below, providing short cuts in all directions. On the green hills could be seen the reflection of pear-blossom and willows.\n\n\"Any house in such a place must strike one as rather commonplace,\" observed Chin Cheng as he entered. But as he did so a lofty rock-face confronted him, covered with creepers and moss and half hiding the buildings behind, while on the rock grew a cluster of beautiful fragrant plants.\n\n\"This is pleasant,\" he exclaimed. \"But what plants are these? I don't seem to recognize them.\"\n\nSome suggested wistaria, others liana.\n\n\"Wistaria and liana haven't this delicate fragrance,\" objected Chin Cheng.\n\n\"I'm sure they're not,\" said Pao-yu. \"Among all these different plants there are some lianas and wistarias, but the fragrant ones are pollia and asarum. That one over there must be orchis, this one golden-thread, that green creeper, and the other purple ruelia. The red ones are, of course, purple iris, and the green ones are certainly green iris. Most of these rare plants are mentioned in the Li Sao and Wen Xuan. For instance, this is 'living in the mountain rocks, with roots in banks of sand,' that is 'fresh and green in the evening mist,' and this is 'girdling the rock and embracing the crag.'\"\n\nThere are also things like horn ginger and scallion ginger, or purple cord and red thread. And there are rock-weed, green sargassum and other plants mentioned by Zuo Taichong in his Rhapsody on the Wu Capital, as well as green shoot, red pepper, mint and lotus which appear in his Rhapsody on Shu. But as the years have passed and times changed, these have become unrecognizable and people have named them according to their shape, often making mistakes.”\n\nBefore he could finish, Jia Zheng snapped, “Who asked for your opinion?”\n\nBaoyu stepped back apprehensively and said no more.\n\nJia Zheng, observing that the covered corridors on both sides led through to an inner suite of rooms, entered one of these corridors. It brought them to a five-frame building with a back shed and outlying verandahs on all four sides. The green windows and oil-smooth walls here were more elegant than anywhere else.\n\n“If one brews tea or strums the lute in this room,” observed Jia Zheng, “there is no need of any incense. The ingenious planning of this place took me by surprise. You gentlemen must compose some fine inscriptions and a name for it.”\n\n“What could be better than ‘Breezes through Orchids and Dew on Angelica’?” they proposed.\n\n“That is the only possible name. And what couplets would be appropriate?”\n\n“We have thought of one,” volunteered one of them, “but we would like you gentlemen to help us polish it. It is:\n\nMusk orchids sweet in the sunset courtyard,\nAsarums fragrant by the moonlit island.”\n\n“Excellent!” cried the rest. “But the phrase ‘sunset courtyard’ is rather poor.”\n\nThe poet cited the line from an old poem, “Angelicas fill the courtyard to mourn the setting sun.”\n\n“Too decadent!” they protested.\n\nAnother man said, “I have a couplet. Will you criticize it for me?\n\nFragrant the paths where jade-like orchids grow,\nBright the moon which gilds the golden clover.”\n\nJia Zheng, stroking his chin, meditated on this. He was thinking out a couplet himself when, looking up, he saw Baoyu standing meekly by. He rounded on him.\n\n“Why don’t you speak when you should? Are you waiting for an invitation? Is that it?”\n\n“There are no such things here as ‘orchid and musk,’ ‘moonlight’ or ‘islands,’” retorted Baoyu. “If we stick to hackneyed phrases like that, we can produce two hundred couplets and still not finish.”\n\n“Who’s forcing you to use such terms?” fumed his father.\n\n“In that case, wouldn’t ‘Fragrant Rue and Iris’ be a better name for this place? And for the couplet:\n\nThe lines we forge on cardamoms are fragrant still;\nEven in dreams when roses fade their scent lives on.”\n\nJia Zheng chuckled, “You are merely imitating the line:\n\n‘Writing on plantain leaves the characters stay green.’\n\nThere is nothing original about that.”\n\n“Li Bai in his poem about the Phoenix Terrace imitated the whole format of Cui Hao’s poem about Yellow Crane Tower,” they protested. “What matters is that the imitation is good. On closer consideration, this couplet of your son’s is more subtle and original than the other.”\n\n“What nonsense!” Jia Zheng smiled.\n\nThey walked on a little way until they saw a lofty pavilion with many storeys, soaringeaves and carved roof. It was surrounded by cloisters and winding covered ways. Pines brushed the eaves, magnolias grew round the steps, and the golden designs on the balustrades and the coloured patterns on the lintels were exquisitely carved.\n\n“This must be the main palace,” said Jia Zheng. “It is rather too magnificent.”\n\n“The Imperial Consort’s virtue may be to favour frugality,” they said, “but her exalted rank requires such magnificence. This is not excessive.”\n\nAs they walked on a marble memorial arch confronted them, finely carved with coiling dragons and protective demons.\n\n“What inscription should be written here?” asked Jia Zheng.\n\n“‘Fairyland of the Blessed’ would be appropriate.”\n\nJia Zheng said nothing but shook his head.\n\nAt sight of this place Baoyu felt strangely disturbed and fell into a brown study, as if he had been here before. Yet he could not recall on what occasion. As Jia Zheng was ordering him to propose an inscription, he paid no attention, being too preoccupied with his own thoughts. The others supposed that after the strain of the last few hours he was tired out and had no ideas left. Fearing that further demands might drive him to distraction, they urged Jia Zheng not to press him.\n\nWell, you can write it tomorrow,” he said. “I’m afraid the old lady may be getting anxious.”\n\nChia Cheng snorted. “So even you can be stumped, you young rascal. All right, I’ll give you one day. If you can’t produce it tomorrow, I’ll tan your hide. This is the most important spot, so you must do your best.”\n\nHe led the party out then to look at the rest of the grounds, only to find that less than half the sights had been viewed when a servant announced that a messenger had come from Yu-tsun. Chia Cheng chuckled.\n\n“We can’t see the rest, but at least we can go out by that path and get a rough idea of that part.”\n\nHe conducted his guests to a large bridge above a lock. The water below cascaded down like crystal roll-blinds. This lock, which controlled the stream flowing in from the river outside, was called the Lock of Seeping Fragrance.\n\n“What’s the name of this lock?” asked Chia Cheng.\n\n“This is the main source of the Seeping Fragrance Stream,” Pao-yu told him. “So it’s called the Lock of Seeping Fragrance.”\n\n“Nonsense!” fumed his father. “We’ll have no more of this ‘Seeping Fragrance.’”\n\nThey walked on past quiet lodges, thatched cottages, stone walls, latticed fences, a hidden numnery in the hills, a Taoist priestess’ retreat in the woods, covered corridors, grottoes and square or round pavilions. But Chia Cheng had no time to go in, being tired after his long ramble and eager to rest when he saw a building ahead.\n\n“We must rest here,” he said, and led his party through a moon gate overhung with creepers and formed of bamboos and flowers into a whitewashed wall with a green willows. Inside, a covered walk on the west connected with the rooms, and in the courtyard were some rocks and a plantain, as well as a海棠-tree whose branches, hanging down to the ground, looked like a canopy. Its blossoms, red as cinnabar, resembled so many dancing butterflies.\n\n“What a beautiful tree!” exclaimed the literary men. “We’ve seen plenty of海棠, but never one so fine.”\n\n“This is called a ‘maiden海棠,’” Chia Cheng told them. “It comes from foreign parts. The popular belief that it comes from the ‘Maiden Land’ is a mere fable.”\n\n“Well, whether that’s true or not, this is certainly unique,” they replied.\n\nPao-yu put in, “Probably some poet gave it the name ‘maiden’ because it’s as red as a girl’s cheeks and as delicate as a weak, ailing girl. This led to a lot of wild talk.”\n\n“That makes sense,” cried the others.\n\nAs they were talking they seated themselves on the couches in the corridor.\n\n“What would be a good name here?” asked Chia Cheng.\n\n“ ‘Plantain and Stork’ would sound well.”\n\n“No, ‘Dazzling Radiance and Rich Displays’ would be better.”\n\n“Yes, that’s excellent,” agreed Chia Cheng and the rest. “That hits it off.”\n\nPao-yu approved too but observed, “It’s a pity.”\n\n“Why?” they asked.\n\n“Since there are both plantain and海棠 here, the two are implied in the name. If you bring out one you lose the other. It would be better to have both.”\n\n“What would you suggest then?” asked his father.\n\n“I propose ‘Red Fragrance and Green Jade.’”\n\nChia Cheng shook his head. “No, that won’t do.”\n\nHe led the company inside. The interior, unlike other places, was unpartitioned. The walls were covered with exquisitely carved and gilded woodwork in designs of clouds, bats, the “three friends of winter,” landscapes, human figures, birds, flowers, embroidery and curios, as well as countless “good luck” and “longevity” characters. In niches were books, tripods, writing materials, vases of flowers or miniature landscape gardens. The frames of the partitions were of different shapes — square, round, sunflower, banana-leaf or half-moon.\n\nThe place was a dazzling array of flowers and carving, translucent and gem-like. In one place figured silk gauze had been pasted over the windows, in another thin silk covered the doorways. All the walls were lined with recesses made in the form of antiques — lutes, swords, vases and the like — suspended from the walls on a level with the surface.\n\n“How exquisitely it’s done!” they cried. “What workmanship!”\n\nJia Zheng and his party had walked less than half-way when they lost their way. To left and right were doorways and passages, but as they approached what looked like an exit, a bookcase barring their way forced them to turn back, only to find another clear prospect through gauze windows. But as they reached the doorway, they saw some people approaching — their own reflections in a large mirror. Going round this they discovered yet more doors.\n\nJia Zhen chuckled.\n\n“Uncle, please come this way. The way out is through this courtyard. It’s actually a short cut to the back court.”\n\nHe led the party through two covered passages and out into a courtyard gay with rambler roses. Round a screen of flowering plants they were confronted by a clear stream barred by a balustrade. In surprise they asked:\n\n“Where does this water come from?”\n\nJia Zhen pointed to a spot not far off.\n\n“It flows in from that lock over there,” he told them. “The water is brought from the stream at the cave’s mouth in that hollow to the northeast, and channeled into the village. From the south side of the village a branch stream is diverted to here, then both streams meet again at that sluice before flowing out under the wall.”\n\n“How ingenious!” exclaimed the whole party.\n\nAs they spoke they came to a large mountain which blocked their way and the party, at a loss, wondered which way to go.\n\n“Follow me,” cried Jia Zhen, and led the way round the foot of the mountain to a level stretch and a broad road — and there before them was the main entrance.\n\n“What fun!” they cried. “We had no idea the place was so full of tricks.”\n\nWith that they left the garden.\n\nBut Bao-yu, who had been worrying about the girls inside and waiting for his father’s instructions, had to follow him to his study. Then Jia Zheng suddenly remembered him.\n\n“Why are you still here?” he asked. “Don’t you think you’ve done enough sight-seeing? And aren’t you afraid the old lady may be waiting for you?”\n\nBao-yu withdrew in haste. And outside the court he found his father’s pages who seized hold of him.\n\n“Thanks to the master being in a good mood today, madam has sent to ask after you several times,” they said. “We reported that all was well. Otherwise, Her Ladyship would have sent to fetch you and you wouldn’t have been able to show off. Everybody says the poems you wrote today were better than all the others. Now you’ve won such praise, you ought to tip us.”\n\n“All right. A string of cash each.”\n\n“Who hasn’t seen a string of cash?” they jeered. “Give us that pouch instead.” With that they set upon him and stripped him of all his fans, sachets and other pendants.\n\n“Now take these things to him properly,” they ordered.\n\nThey escorted him to the Lady Dowager’s gate, where the old lady was waiting for him. She was pleased to know that he had not been too harshly treated.\n\nSoon after his return, Aroma brought him tea and noticed that he had nothing left on him.\n\n“Those shameless wretches have taken all your things again,” she commented.\n\nWhen Dai-yu heard this, she came over to look and confirmed that he had indeed lost everything.\n\n“Did you give them the pouch I made you too?” she asked. “Well, don’t expect anything more from me in future.”\n\nShe went back to her room in high dudgeon and, taking the scented bag she had been making for him, cut it up with her scissors before Bao-yu could stop her.\n\nAlthough the bag was unfinished, he had been struck by its exquisite workmanship. Now, for no reason, she had cut it up. He was very provoked. Unbuttoning his collar he drew out the pouch he was wearing next to his skin and held it out to her.\n\n“Look at this. When did I ever give anyone anything of yours?”\n\nNoticing how careful he was to wear the pouch inside his clothes where it could not easily be taken, Daiyu realized that she had been too impetuous in cutting up the sachet. She hung her head without a word.\n\n“There was no need to cut it up,” he said. “I know you’re too lazy to make me things. I’ll give you this pouch back too, shall I?” With that he tossed it into her lap.\n\nThis made her angrier than ever. She burst into tears and picked up the pouch to cut that up too. Baoyu snatched it from her.\n\n“Do let it off, dear cousin!” he begged with a grin.\n\nDaiyu threw down her scissors and wiped her tears.\n\n“You needn’t be by turns so nice and so nasty,” she sobbed. “If you’re cross with me, let’s part company.” With that she went to bed in a huff, turning her face to the wall and drying her eyes.\n\nBaoyu had to come to her then and plead, “Dear cousin!” again and again.\n\nJust then the Lady Dowager sent to summon him. When the maid reported that he was with his Cousin Lin, the old lady said, “Very good. Let him stay and play with his cousins. He’s been cooped up with his father so long, he deserves a little fun. Only don’t let them quarrel.”\n\nThe servants assented.\n\nUnable to shake Baoyu off, Daiyu sat up.\n\n“If you won’t let me have any peace, I shall go away.” She started to leave the room.\n\nBaoyu laughed. “I’ll go wherever you go.” He picked up the pouch to put it on again.\n\nDaiyu reached out for it. “Now you want to wear it after saying you wouldn’t. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.” With that she burst out laughing.\n\n“Dear cousin, will you make me another sachet tomorrow?”\n\n“We’ll see how I feel.”\n\nThey went out then together to Lady Wang’s apartments, and found Baochai there too.\n\nThe place was unusually lively, for Jia Qiang had just come back after buying twelve young actresses in Soochow as well as costumes and properties, and engaging instructors. Aunt Xue had moved now into quiet quarters in another compound to the northeast, and Pear Fragrance Court had been repaired for the training of the actresses. Some older women servants who had once been actresses themselves were put in charge of them, and Jia Qiang was made responsible for all their expenses and the keeping of accounts.\n\nThen Lin Zhixiao’s wife came to report: “The twelve little Buddhist nuns and Taoist novices we sent to find and buy have all arrived. The twenty new vestments are ready too. There’s also a young nun who’s kept her hair. She comes from a family of scholars and officials in Soochow. Because she was always ill as a child, they bought several substitutes, but that didn’t help; so she had to enter the gate of retirement and now she’s a lay nun. That cured her. She’s eighteen and her name is Miaoyu. Her parents are dead now and she has only two old nurses and a young maid to look after her. She’s most widely read and well versed in the scriptures, and she’s very good-looking too. When she heard that the capital had relics of the Goddess of Mercy and Buddhist texts inscribed on pattra leaves, she came here last year with her tutor and is now living in the Convent of the Goddess in the west of the city. Her tutor was an expert in prophetic lore and knew all about the after-life. She died last winter. Before dying she told Miaoyu she should not return to the south but wait here, as something was going to happen. That’s why she hasn’t taken her tutor’s coffin home.”\n\n“Why don’t we ask her to come here?” proposed Lady Wang.\n\n“We did put that to her,” replied Lin Zhixiao’s wife. “But she said, ‘All noble officials’ families are sure to bully people. I’m not going there.’”\n\n“Since she’s the daughter of an official, she must be proud,” remarked Lady Wang. “Why not send her an invitation?”\n\nLin Zhixiao’s wife agreed to do this. She went out and told the secretaries to write an invitation and send it to Miaoyu. The next day carriages were dispatched to fetch her.\n\nBut more of this later.\n\nTo be continued in the next chapter."
