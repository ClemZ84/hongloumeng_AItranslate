  "original": "话说宝玉一听麝月的话，身往后仰，复又死去，急得王夫人等哭叫不止。麝月自知失言致祸，此时王夫人等也不及说他。那麝月一面哭着，一面打算主意，心想：“若宝玉一死，我便自尽，跟了他去。”\n　　不言麝月心里的事。且说王夫人等见叫不回来，赶着叫人出来找和尚救治。岂知贾政进内出去时，那和尚已不见了。贾政正在诧异，听见里头又闹，急忙进来，见宝玉又是先前的样子，牙关紧闭，脉息全无。用手在心窝中一摸，尚是温热。贾政只得急忙请医，灌药救治。那知那宝玉的魂魄早已出了窍了。你道死了不成？却原来恍恍惚惚赶到前厅，见那送玉的和尚坐着，便施了礼。那和尚忙站起身来，拉着宝玉就走。宝玉跟了和尚，觉得身轻如叶，飘飘摇摇，也没出大门，也不知从那里走出来了。\n　　行了一程，到了个荒野地方，远远的望见一座牌楼，好象曾到过的。正要问那和尚，只见恍恍惚惚又来了一个女人。宝玉心里想道：“这样旷野地方，那得有如此的丽人？必是神仙下界了。”宝玉想着，走近前来，细细一看，竟有些认得的，只是一时想不起来。只见那女人合和尚打了一个照面，就不见了。宝玉一想，竟是尤三姐的样子，越发纳闷：“怎么他也在这里？”又要问时，那和尚早拉着宝玉过了牌楼。只见牌上写着“真如福地”四个大字，两边一副对联，乃是：\n　　假去真来真胜假，无原有是有非无。\n　　转过牌坊，便是一座宫门。门上也横书着四个大字道：“福善祸淫”。又有一副对联，大书云：\n　　过去未来，莫谓智贤能打破；\n　　前因后果，须知亲近不相逢。\n　　宝玉看了，心下想道：“原来如此，我倒要问问因果来去的事了。”这么一想，只见鸳鸯站在那里，招手儿叫他。宝玉想道：“我走了半日，原不曾出园子，怎么改了样儿了呢？”赶着要合鸳鸯说话，岂知一转眼便不见了，心里不免疑惑起来。走到鸳鸯站的地方儿，乃是一溜配殿，各处都有匾额。宝玉无心去看，只向鸳鸯立的所在奔去，只见一间配殿的门半掩半开。宝玉也不敢造次进去，心里正要问那和尚一声，回过头来，和尚早已不见了。宝玉恍惚见那殿宇巍峨，绝非大观园景象，便立住脚，抬头看那匾额上写道：“引觉情痴。”两边写的对联道：\n　　喜笑悲哀都是假；贪求思慕总因痴。\n　　宝玉看了，便点头叹息。想要进去找鸳鸯，问他是什么所在。细细想来，甚是熟识，便仗着胆子推门进去。满屋一瞧，并不见鸳鸯，里头只是黑漆漆的。心下害怕。正要退出，见有十数个大橱，橱门半掩。宝玉忽然想起：“我少时做梦，曾到过这样个地方；如今能够亲身到此，也是大幸。”恍惚间，把找鸳鸯的念头忘了，便仗着胆子把上首大橱开了橱门一瞧，见有好几本册子。心里更觉喜欢，想道：“大凡人做梦，说是假的，岂知有这梦便有这事！我常说还要做这个梦再不能的，不料今儿被我找着了。但不知那册子是那个见过的不是。”伸手在上头取了一本，册上写着“金陵十二钗正册”。宝玉拿着一想道：“我恍惚记得是那个，只恨记得不清楚。”便打开头一页看去。见上头有画，但是画迹模糊，再瞧不出来。后面有几行字迹，也不清楚，尚可摹拟，便细细的看去。见有什么玉带上头有个好象“林”字，心里想道：“莫不是说林妹妹罢？”便认真看去。底下又有“金簪雪里”四字，诧异道：“怎么又象他的名字呢？”复将前后四句合起来一念道：“也没有什么道理，只是暗藏着他两个名字，并不为奇。独有那‘怜’字‘叹’字不好。这是怎么解？”想到那里，又啐道：“我是偷着看，若只管呆想起来，倘有人来，又看不成了。”遂往后看，也无暇细玩那画图，只从头看去。看到尾上有几句词，什么“虎兔相逢大梦归”一句，便恍然大悟道：“是了，果然机关不爽。这必是元春姐姐了。若都是这样明白，我要抄了去细玩起来，那些姊妹们的寿夭穷通，没有不知的了。我回去自不肯泄漏，只做一个未卜先知的人，也省了多少闲想。”又向各处一瞧，并没有笔砚。又恐人来，只得忙着看去。只见图上影影有一个放风筝的人儿，也无心去看。急急的将那十二首诗词都看遍了，也有一看便知的，也有一想便得的，也有不大明白的，心下牢牢记着。一面叹息，一面又取那“金陵又副册”一看。看到“堪羡优伶有福，谁知公子无缘”，先前不懂，见上面尚有花席的影子，便大惊痛哭起来。\n　　待要往后再看，听见有人说道：“你又发呆了，林妹妹请你呢。”好似鸳鸯的声气，回头却不见人。心中正自惊疑，忽鸳鸯在门外招手。宝玉一见，喜得赶出来，但见鸳鸯在前，影影绰绰的走，只是赶不上。宝玉叫道：“好姐姐等等我！”那鸳鸯并不理，只顾前走。宝玉无奈，尽力赶去。忽见别有一洞天，楼阁高耸，殿角玲珑，且有好些宫女隐约其间。宝玉贪看景致，竟将鸳鸯忘了。宝玉顺步走入一座宫门，内有奇花异卉，都也认不明白，惟有白石花栏围着一颗青草，叶头上略有红色，“但不知是何名草，这样矜贵？”只见微风动处，那青草已摆摇不休。虽说是一枝小草，又无花朵，其妩媚之态，不禁心动神怡，魂消魄丧。宝玉只管呆呆的看着，只听见旁边有一人说道：“你是那里来的蠢物，在此窥探仙草！”宝玉听了，吃了一惊，回头看时，却是一位仙女，便施礼道：“我找鸳鸯姐姐，误入仙境，恕我冒昧之罪。请问神仙姐姐：这里是何地方？怎么我鸳鸯姐姐到此？还说是林妹妹叫我？望乞明示。”那人道：“谁知你的姐姐妹妹？我是看管仙草的，不许凡人在此逗留。”宝玉欲待要出来，又舍不得，只得央告道：“神仙姐姐既是那管理仙草的，必然是花神姐姐了。但不知这草有何好处？”那仙女道：“你要知道这草，说起来话长着呢。那草本在灵河岸上，名曰‘绛珠草’。因那时萎败，幸得一个神瑛侍者日以甘露灌溉，得以长生。后来降凡历劫，还报了灌溉之恩，今返归真境。所以警幻仙子命我看管，不令蜂缠蝶恋。”宝玉听了不解，一心疑定必是遇见了花神了，今日断不可当面错过，便问：“管这草的是神仙姐姐了。还有无数名花，必有专管的，我也不敢烦问，只有看芙蓉花的是那位神仙？”那仙女道：“我却不知，除是我主人方晓。”宝玉便问道：“姐姐的主人是谁？”那仙女道：“我主人是潇湘妃子。”宝玉听道：“是了，你不知道，这位妃子就是我的表妹林黛玉。”那仙女道：“胡说！此地乃上界神女之所，虽号为潇湘妃子，并不是娥皇女英之辈，何得与凡人有亲？你少来混说，瞧着叫力士打你出去。”\n　　宝玉听了发怔，只觉自形秽浊。正要退出，又听见有人赶来，说道：“里面叫请神瑛侍者。”那人道：“我奉命等了好些时，总不见有神瑛侍者过来，你叫我那里请去？”那一个笑道：“才退去的不是么？”那侍女慌忙赶出来，说：“请神瑛侍者回来。”宝玉只道是问别人，又怕被人追赶，只得踉跄而逃。正走时，只见一人手提宝剑，迎面拦住，说：“那里走！”吓得宝玉惊惶无措。仗着胆抬头一看，却不是别人，就是尤三姐。宝玉见了，略定些神，央告道：“姐姐，怎么你也来逼起我来了？”那人道：“你们弟兄没有一个好人！败人名节，破人婚姻，今儿你到这里，是不饶你的了！”宝玉听了话头不好，正自着急，只听后面有人叫道：“姐姐快快拦住，不要放他走了。”尤三姐道：“我奉妃子之命，等候已久。今儿见了，必定要一剑斩断你的尘缘！”宝玉听了，益发着忙，又不懂这些话到底是什么意思，只得回头要跑。\n　　岂知身后说话的并非别人，却是晴雯。宝玉一见，悲喜交集，便说：“我一个人走迷了道儿，遇见仇人，我要逃回，却不见你们一人跟着我。如今好了，晴雯姐姐，快快的带我回家去罢！”晴雯道：“侍者不必多疑。我非晴雯，我是奉妃子之命，特来请你一会，并不难为你。”宝玉满腹狐疑，只得问道：“姐姐说是妃子叫我，那妃子究是何人？”晴雯道：“此时不必问，到了那里自然知道。”宝玉没法，只得跟着走。细看那人背后举动，恰是晴雯，“那面目声音是不错的了，怎么他说不是？我此时心里模糊，且别管他，到了那边，见了妃子，就有不是，那时再求他。到底女人的心肠是慈悲的，必定恕我冒失。”正想着，不多时到了一个所在，只见殿宇精致，彩色辉煌，庭中一丛翠丛，户外数本苍松。廊檐下立着几个侍女都是宫妆打扮，见了宝玉进来，便悄悄的说道：“这就是神瑛侍者么？”引着宝玉的说道：“就是，你快进去通报罢。”\n　　有一侍女笑着招手，宝玉便跟着进去。过了几层房舍，见一正房，珠帘高挂。那侍女说：“站着候旨。”宝玉听了，也不敢则声，只好在外等着。那侍女进去不多时，出来说：“请侍者参见。”又有一人卷起珠帘。只见一女子头戴花冠，身穿绣服，端坐在内。宝玉略一抬头，见是黛玉的形容，便不禁的说道：“妹妹在这里，叫我好想！”那帘外的侍女悄叱道：“这侍者无礼，快快出去！”话犹未了，又见一个侍儿将珠帘放下。宝玉此时欲待进去又不敢，要走又不舍，待要问明，见那些侍女并不认得，又被驱逐，无奈出来。心想要问晴雯，回头四顾，并不见有晴雯。心下狐疑，只得怏怏出来，又无人引着。正欲找原路而去，却又找不出旧路了。\n　　正在为难，见凤姐站在一所房檐下招手儿。宝玉看见，喜欢道：“可好了，原来回到自己家里了。怎么一时迷乱如此？”急奔前来说：“姐姐在这里么？我被这些人捉弄到这个分儿，林妹妹又不肯见我，不知是何原故？”说着，走到凤姐站的地方，细看起来，并不是凤姐，原来却是贾蓉的前妻秦氏。宝玉只得立住脚，要问凤姐姐在那里。那秦氏也不答言，竟自往屋里去了。宝玉恍恍惚惚的，又不敢跟进去，只得呆呆的站着，叹道：“我今儿得了什么不是，众人都不理我！”便痛哭起来。见有几个黄巾力士执鞭赶来，说道：“何处男人，敢闯入我们这天仙福地来！快走出去！”宝玉听得，不敢言语。正要寻路出来，远远望见一群女子，说笑前来。宝玉看时，又象是迎春等一干人走来，心里喜欢，叫道：“我迷住在这里，你们快来救我！”正嚷着，后面力士赶来，宝玉急得往前乱跑。忽见那一群女子都变作鬼怪形象，也来追扑。\n　　宝玉正在情急，只见那送玉来的和尚，手里拿着一面镜子一照，说道：“我奉元妃娘娘旨意，特来救你。”登时鬼怪全无，仍是一片荒郊。宝玉拉着和尚说道：“我记得是你领我到这里，你一时又不见了。看见了好些亲人，只是都不理我，忽又变作鬼怪。到底是梦是真？望老师明白指示。”那和尚道：“你到这里，曾偷看什么东西没有？”宝玉一想，道：“他既能带我到天仙福地，自然也是神仙了，如何瞒得他？况且正要问个明白。”便道：“我倒见了好些册子来着。”那和尚道：“可又来。你见了册子，还不解么？世上的情缘，都是那些魔障，只要把历过的事情细细记着，将来我与你说明。”说着，把宝玉狠命的一推，说：“回去罢。”宝玉站不住脚，一跤跌倒，口里嚷道：“阿哟！”\n　　众人正在哭泣，听见宝玉苏来，连忙叫唤。宝玉睁眼看时，仍躺在炕上，见王夫人、宝钗等哭的眼泡红肿。定神一想，心里说道：“是了，我是死去过来的。”逐把神魂所历的事，呆呆的细想。幸喜多还记得，便哈哈的笑道：“是了，是了。”王夫人只道旧病复发，便好延医调治，即命丫头婆子快去告诉贾政，说是：“宝玉回过来了。心里原是心迷住了，如今说出话来，不用备办后事了。”贾政听了，即忙进来看视，果见宝玉苏来，便道：“没福的痴儿！你要唬死谁么？”说着，眼泪也不知不觉流下来了。又叹了几口气，仍出去叫人请医生，诊脉服药。\n　　这里麝月正思自尽，见宝玉一过来，也放了心。只见王夫人叫人端了桂圆汤，叫他喝了几口，渐渐的定了神。王夫人等放心，也没有说麝月，只叫人仍把那玉交给宝钗给他带上。想起那和尚来，“这玉不知那里找来的？也是古怪。怎么一时要银，一时又不见了？莫非是神仙不成？”宝钗道：“说起那和尚来的踪迹、去的影响，那玉并不是找来的。头里丢的时候，必是那和尚取去的。”王夫人道：“玉在家里，怎么能取的了去？”宝钗道：“既可送来，就可取去。”袭人、麝月道：“那年丢了玉，林大爷测了个字，后来二奶奶过了门，我还告诉过二奶奶，说测的那字是什么‘赏’字。二奶奶还记得么？”宝钗想道：“是了，你们说测的是当铺里找去，如今才明白了，竟是个和尚的‘尚’字在上头，可不是和尚取了去的么？”王夫人道：“那和尚本来古怪！那年宝玉病的时候，那和尚来说是我们家有宝贝可解，说的就是这块玉了。他既知道，自然这块玉到底有些来历。况且你女婿养下来就嘴里含着的，古往今来，你们听见过这么第二个么？只是不知终久这块玉到底怎么着，就连咱们这一个，也还不知是怎么着呢。病也是这块玉，好也是这块玉，生也是这块玉。”说到这里，忽然住了，不免又流下泪来。宝玉听了，心里却也明白，更想死去的事，愈加有因，只不言语，心里细细的记忆。\n　　那时惜春便说道：“那年失玉，还请妙玉请过仙，说是‘青埂峰下倚古松’，还有什么‘入我门来一笑逢’的话。想起来‘入我门’三字，大有讲究。佛教法门最大，只怕二哥哥不能入得去。”宝王听了，又冷笑几声。宝钗听着，不觉的把眉头儿胳揪着发起怔来。尤氏道：“偏你一说又是佛门了，你出家的念头还没有歇么？”惜春笑道：“不瞒嫂子说，我早已断了荤了。”王夫人道：“好孩子，阿弥陀佛，这个念头是起不得的！”惜春听了，也不言语。宝玉想“青灯古佛旁”的诗句，不禁连叹几声。忽又想起一床席、一枝花的诗句来，拿眼睛看着袭人，不觉又流下泪来。众人都见他忽笑忽悲，也不解是何意，只道是他的旧病，岂知宝玉触处机来，竟能把偷看册上的诗句牢牢记住了，只是不说出来，心中早有一家成见在那里了，暂且不提。\n　　且说众人见宝玉死去复生，神气清爽，又加连日服药，一天好似一天，渐渐的复原起来。便是贾政见宝玉巳好，现在丁忧无事，想起贾赦不知几时遇赦，老太太的灵柩久停寺内，终不放心，欲要扶柩回南安葬，便叫了贾琏来商议。贾琏便道：“老爷想的极是。如今趁着丁忧，干了这件大事更好。将来老爷起了服，只怕又不能遂意了。但是我父亲不在家，侄儿又不敢僭越。老爷的主意很好，只是这件事也得好几千银子。衙门里缉赃，那是再缉不出来的。”贾政道：“我的主意是定了。只为大老爷不在家，叫你来商议商议，怎么个办法。你是不能出门的，现在这里没有人；我想好几口材，都要带回去，我一个人怎么能够照应？想着把蓉哥儿带了去，况且有他媳妇的棺材，也在里头。还有你林妹妹的，那是老太太的遗言，说跟着老太太一块儿回去的。我想这一项银子，只好在那里挪借几千，也就够了。”贾琏道：“如今的人情过于淡薄。老爷呢，又丁忧；我们老爷呢，又在外头。一时借是借不出来的了，只好拿房地文书出去押去。”贾政道：“住的房子是官盖的，那里动得？”贾琏道：“住房是不能动的。外头还有几所可以出脱的，等老爷起复后再赎也使得。将来我父亲回来了，倘能也再起用，也好赎的。只是老爷这么大年纪，辛苦这一场，侄儿们心里却不安。”贾政道：“老太太的事是应该的。只要你在家谨慎些，把持定了才好。”贾琏道：“老爷这倒只管放心，侄儿虽糊涂。断不敢不认真办理的。况且老爷回南，少不得多带些人去，所留下的人也有限了，这点子费用还可以过的来。就是老爷路上短少些，必经过赖尚荣的地方，可以叫他出点力儿。”贾政道：“自己老人家的事，叫人家帮什么呢？”贾琏答应了个“是”，便退出来，打算银钱。\n　　贾政便告诉了王夫人，叫他管了家，自己择了发引长行的日子，就要起身。宝玉此时身体复元，贾环、贾兰倒认真念书，贾政都交付给贾琏，叫他管教：“今年是大比的年头，环儿是有服的，不能入场；兰儿是孙子，服满了也可以考的，务必叫宝玉同着侄儿考去。能够中一个举人，也好赎一赎咱们的罪名。”贾琏等唯唯应命。贾政又吩咐了在家的人，说了好些话，才别了宗祠，便在城外念了几天经，就发引下船，带了林之孝等而去。也没有惊动亲友，惟有自家男女送了一程回来。\n　　宝玉因贾政命他赴考，王夫人便不时催逼，查考起他的工课来。那宝钗袭人时常劝勉，自不必说。那知宝玉病后，虽精神日长，他的念头一发更奇僻了，竟换了一种，不但厌弃功名仕进，竟把那儿女情缘也看淡了好些。只是众人不大理会，宝玉也并不说出来。\n一日，恰遇紫鹃送了林黛玉的灵柩回来，闷坐自己屋里啼哭，想着：“宝玉无情，见他林妹妹的灵柩回去，并不伤心落泪；见我这样痛哭，也不来劝慰，反瞅着我笑。这样负心的人，从前都是花言巧语来哄着我们。前夜亏我想得开，不然几乎又上了他的当！只是一件叫人不解：如今我看他待袭人也是冷冷儿的。二奶奶是本来不喜欢亲热的，麝月那些人就不抱怨他么？看来女孩儿们多半是痴心的，白操了那些时的心，不知将来怎样结局！”正想着，只见五儿走来瞧他。见紫鹃满面泪痕，便说：“姐姐又哭林姑娘了？我想一个人，闻名不如眼见。头里听着，二爷女孩子跟前是最好的，我母亲再三的把我弄进来：岂知我进来了，尽心竭力的伏侍了几次病，如今病好了，连一句好话也没有剩出来，这会子索性连正眼儿也不瞧了。”紫鹃听他说的好笑，便噗嗤的一笑，啐道：“呸！你这小蹄子，你心里要宝玉怎么样待你才好？女孩儿家也不害燥。人家明公正气的屋里人他瞧着还没事人一大堆呢，有功夫理你去？”因又笑着拿个指头往脸上抹着问道：“你到底算宝玉的什么人那？”那五儿听了自知失言，便飞红了脸。待要解说不是要宝玉怎样看待，说他近来不怜下的话，只听院门外乱嚷，说：“外头和尚又来了，要那一万银子呢！太太着急，叫琏二爷和他讲去，偏偏琏二爷又不在家。那和尚在外头说些疯话，太太叫请二奶奶过去商量。”\n    不知怎样打发那和尚，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Hearing Sheyue’s words, Baoyu fell back and once more lost consciousness. Lady Wang and the rest were so frantic that they could do nothing but weep and cry out. Sheyue knew that her unfortunate remark had caused this, but Lady Wang and the rest were too distraught to scold her. Sheyue wept as she made up her mind: “If he dies, I shall kill myself and follow him!”\n\nBut enough of her thoughts.\n\nWhen Lady Wang and the others saw that their cries were to no avail, they sent servants out to find the monk and save Baoyu. However, Jia Zheng, upon going out to look for him, found that the monk had disappeared. He was puzzling over this when he heard fresh commotion inside and hurried back to find Baoyu in the same state as before, his teeth clenched and no pulse discernible, though when they felt his heart they found it still warm. Jia Zheng lost no time in sending for doctors to pour medicine down his throat and save him. But by then, Baoyu’s spirit had already left its body. Do you think he was really dead?\n\nHis spirit, faint and hazy, drifted to the front hall where he saw the monk who had brought the jade sitting there. He bowed to him, and the monk promptly stood up and taking his hand hurried him away. Baoyu followed him, light as a leaf, floating along without passing through the main gate, not knowing which way they went.\n\nAfter travelling for some time they reached a wilderness, and in the distance Baoyu saw a memorial arch which looked familiar. He was about to ask the monk what it was when a woman appeared, faint and hazy. Baoyu reflected, “How can there be such a beauty in this wild place? She must be an immortal come down to earth.” As he drew closer for a better look, she seemed familiar, but he could not recall who she was. Then the woman and the monk exchanged glances and she vanished. It dawned on Baoyu that she resembled Third Sister You. “How is it she is here?” he wondered in surprise. He was about to ask the monk when the latter hurried him through the archway on which was inscribed in large characters: The Paradise of Truth. And flanking this was the couplet:\n\nWhen the unreal becomes real the real becomes unreal;\nWhere non-existence gains existence existence becomes non-existence.\n\nBeyond the archway was a palace gate, above which was written: Blessing for the Good, Retribution for the Wicked. Another couplet read:\n\nDo not say that the wise and good can break karma;\nKnow that cause and effect are determined in previous existences.\n\n“So that’s how it is!” thought Baoyu. “I must ask the monk what this causality means.”\n\nAs the thought crossed his mind, he saw Yuanyang standing there beckoning to him. “I’ve been walking all this time, but I’m still in the Garden,” he reflected. “Why has it changed so?” He hurried forward to speak to her, but she suddenly disappeared, which rather perplexed him. Going to the place where she had stood, he found a row of side chambers with horizontal boards bearing inscriptions, but he was in no mood to read these and simply headed for the spot where Yuanyang had been. There, the door of one of the side chambers was ajar. Not venturing to enter uninvited, he was about to ask the monk about it when he turned round to find that the monk had disappeared. Looking dazedly at the imposing building, so unlike Prospect Garden, he halted and saw on the board the words: “Awakening for the Infatuated.” The couplet on the two sides read:\n\nHappiness, laughter, grief and sorrow are all illusory;\nLonging, avarice, infatuation and attachment are folly.\n\nBaoyu nodded and sighed. He wanted to go in to find Yuanyang and ask her what this place was, for it seemed rather familiar. Plucking up courage, he pushed the door open and went in. The room was dark and he could see no one. He was starting back in fear when he noticed a dozen or more large cases with their doors ajar. It suddenly occurred to him, “When I was young I dreamed I came to a place like this. How nice to find it again today. I wonder what is in these cases? Probably rare treasures. I’ve lost my jade, so I must look in here for it.”\n\nplace. How fortunate I am to be able to come here myself!” In his excitement he forgot his search for Yuanyang. Plucking up courage, he opened the door of the big cabinet in the place of honour and saw several albums. Overjoyed he thought, “People say that dreams are false, but this one is coming true! I’d thought I could never have this dream again, yet now I’ve found these albums. But I wonder if they’re the same ones I saw before?” He reached for the topmost album on which was written in gold “The Twelve Beauties of Jinling.” This struck him as familiar, but he could not be sure. He opened the first page. There was a painting, but it was so blurred he could not make it out. There were several columns of characters too, rather blurred also, though he could make out the words: “On the jade belt. . . .” The next character looked like lin. “Could this refer to Cousin Lin?” he wondered. He looked more carefully and saw the line: “Buried in the snow the broken golden hairpin.” In surprise he exclaimed, “Why, that sounds like Baochai too.” He read the four lines together but could not make them out. “I can’t see any sense in it,” he thought. “It must be just a cryptic reference to their names. There’s nothing strange about that. But what’s the meaning of ‘pity’ and ‘grieve’?” Then he scolded himself, “I’m here for a secret look. If I stay here day-dreaming, if anyone comes I won’t be able to see any more.” He turned the page. Lacking time to study the picture, he saw that it ended with the line: “When hare and tiger meet, from this great dream she must depart.” 1 In a flash he understood. “Yes, it’s a clear prophecy. This must refer to Sister Yuanchun. If all are as clear as this, I’ll copy them down to study them carefully. Then I shall know the life-span and fortunes of all the girls. When I go back I won’t breathe a word about it, but just keep this foreknowledge to myself to save a lot of anxiety.” He looked round but could see no writing-brush or ink-stone. Afraid too that someone might come, he leafed quickly through the album. On one page was the dim figure of a girl flying a kite, but he had no heart to look carefully. He hastily read through all twelve poems. Some were clear, some he could figure out, some baffled him; but he memorized them all. Sighing, he took up the Supplementary Register for Jinling. He read: “Blessed is the actor and lucky the girl — but the young master is out of luck.” This puzzled him until he saw the picture of a mat and flowers on it. Then he burst out sobbing.\n\nHe would have read on then, but he heard someone say, “Are you raving again, Cousin Lin? Cousin Lin wants you.” It sounded like Yuanyang’s voice, but when he turned he saw no one. He was wondering in consternation where she was when Yuanyang beckoned to him from the gateway. Overjoyed, he ran out to her. She walked so fast ahead that he could not catch her up.\n\n“Good sister, wait for me!” he called.\n\nShe took no notice, however, and hurried on. He was panting with the effort to overtake her when he saw another beautiful place. There were towering pavilions and graceful mansions, among which he could make out the indistinct forms of many palace maids. So enchanted was he by the sight that he forgot Yuanyang. He walked through a palace gate into a courtyard full of rare flowers and exotic plants, none of which he recognized. Only a green plant surrounded by a white marble balustrade had crimson buds.\n\n“What plant is this, so highly prized?” he wondered.\n\nA breeze set its branches swaying; and though it was leafless and had no blossoms, its exquisite poise and charm entranced him. As he was gazing at it in rapt admiration, someone said from the gateway, “Where did this oaf come from, spying on us here?”\n\nPeeping at the Fairy Plant!” Baoyu gave a start and turned to see a fairy maiden. He bowed and said, “I came to look for Sister Yuanyang, but lost my way and blundered into this fairy realm. Please forgive my presumption. May I ask, fairy sister, what place this is and how my sister Yuanyang came here? And did Sister Lin send for me? I beg you to enlighten me.”\n\n“I know nothing about your sisters,” she retorted. “I’m in charge of this fairy plant and mortals aren’t allowed to loiter here.”\n\nBaoyu would have left but could not tear himself away. He pleaded, “Since you’re in charge of this plant, fairy sister, you must be the goddess of flowers. But may I ask what is special about this plant?”\n\n“If you want to know, it’s a long story. This plant, which grew by the Divine River, was called Vermilion Pearl. It was languishing there until the page Shen Ying watered it every day with sweet dew, so that it could live on. Then it was incarnated down below to repay this debt of gratitude with tears, and has now returned to its true form. The Goddess of Disenchantment has put me in charge here and won’t allow bees or butterflies to flirt with it.”\n\nBaoyu could not make this out. He felt sure that he had met the goddess of flowers and must not miss this opportunity.\n\n“So you are in charge of this plant, fairy sister,” he said. “There must be many fairies in charge of the other famous flowers, and I wouldn’t like to trouble you by asking about them. But may I ask who is in charge of the hibiscus?”\n\n“I don’t know. Only my mistress knows that.”\n\n“Who is your mistress?”\n\n“The Queen of Bamboo.”\n\n“So that’s it!” he cried. “But you may not know that this queen is my cousin Lin Daiyu.”\n\n“Nonsense! This is the abode of divine maidens. Though she’s called the Queen of Bamboo, she’s not like the queens of old. How could she be related to a mortal? Don’t talk such rubbish, or I’ll call the guards to drive you out.”\n\nBaoyu was nonplussed, feeling that he had made himself unclean. He was about to withdraw when he heard someone running up and calling, “The mistress wants Shen Ying invited in.”\n\nThe fairy replied, “I’ve been waiting here for him for a long time, but he hasn’t come. Where am I to find him?”\n\nThe other laughed. “Wasn’t that him who just left?”\n\nThe waiting-maid hurried out then and called, “Please come back, Shen Ying!”\n\nThinking she meant someone else and afraid of being caught, Baoyu took to his heels. But as he ran, a girl with a sword barred his way.\n\n“Where are you going?” she demanded.\n\nHe was too terrified to think. Summoning up courage to look at her, he saw that it was Third Sister You. He felt a little calmer then and begged her, “Why are you joining in the hunt for me too, sister?”\n\n“You brothers are a bad lot!” she cried. “You’ve ruined girls’ reputations and broken up marriages. Now that you’ve come here, I’m not going to let you off!”\n\nBaoyu was desperate, hearing how viciously she spoke. Then someone behind him called, “Stop him, sister! Don’t let him get away!”\n\nThird Sister You said, “I’ve been waiting here a long time on the queen’s orders. Now that I’ve caught you, I’m to cut through your earthly ties with this sword.”\n\nThis threw Baoyu into a greater panic. Not understanding what was meant, he turned to run away.\n\nThe one who had called out behind him was none other than Qingwen. At sight of her, torn between grief and joy, he cried, “I’ve lost my way and met enemies. I tried to run away but couldn’t find any of you. How lucky that you’ve come, sister Qingwen! Do take me home quickly.”\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” she said. “I’m not Qingwen but have been sent by the queen to invite you to see her. I mean you no harm.”\n\nBewildered though he was, he felt compelled to ask: “You tell me, sister, that the Imperial Consort has sent for me. But which Imperial Consort is it?”\n\n“You’ve no call to ask now,” replied the maid. “You’ll find out when you get there.”\n\nThere was nothing for it but to follow her. He studied her from behind. Her movements were Ching-wen’s to the life. And her face and voice were certainly hers. Why did she deny it? His mind was in a whirl.\n\n‘Anyway, when I get there and see the Imperial Consort, even if I am in the wrong I can beg her forgiveness. Women are kind-hearted creatures and she is sure to pardon me.’\n\nHe was still thinking along these lines when they arrived at a magnificent palace, exquisitely built and resplendent with colour. In the courtyard stood a clump of green trees, and outside the gates several stately pines. A number of palace maids were standing under the eaves of the verandah. When they saw Pao-yu approaching they whispered:\n\n‘So this is the Divine Luminescent Page!’\n\n‘Yes,’ said his guide. ‘Go in quickly and announce him.’\n\nOne of the maids smiled and beckoned to him, and he followed her in. They passed through several apartments and came to a large hall with a beaded curtain hanging in the doorway.\n\n‘Wait here for the Imperial command,’ said the maid.\n\nPao-yu obediently stood outside, not daring to utter a word. The maid went inside and shortly reappeared to say:\n\n‘Her Highness will receive the Page.’\n\nAnother maid lifted the bead curtain, and Pao-yu saw a woman seated within, wearing a coronet and full ceremonial dress. He glanced up and thought he could discern the features of Tai-yu.\n\n‘Oh coz!’ he exclaimed without thinking. ‘So it’s you! How I’ve missed you!’\n\nThe maid standing outside the curtain whispered reprovingly:\n\n‘The Page will withdraw at once! Such insolence!’\n\nEven as she spoke, the curtain was lowered again. Pao-yu wanted to go in but dared not, wanted to leave but could not bring himself to. He wanted to ask the maids for an explanation, but they were all strangers to him and seemed intent on sending him away. He had no choice but to leave. He wanted to find Ching-wen and ask her what was going on, but when he looked around for her she was nowhere to be seen. He stood there in a daze, and finally walked disconsolately out on his own. He tried to find his way back, but seemed to have lost his bearings.\n\nHe was standing there helplessly when he saw Xi-feng beckoning to him from the shadow of a building.\n\n‘Thank goodness!’ he cried delightedly. ‘Now I’m home! How could I have got so confused?’\n\nHe ran up to her.\n\n‘Fancy seeing you here!’ he said. ‘I’ve been most abominably tricked. And Cousin Lin refused to see me. I can’t think why.’\n\nHe reached the spot where Xi-feng had been standing, and on closer inspection saw that it was not her at all, but Chin Ko-ching, Chia Jung’s deceased wife. He stood rooted to the spot, and wanted to ask her where he could find Xi-feng, but she turned without a word and went inside. Pao-yu stood there in a daze, not daring to follow her. Finally he cried out in despair:\n\n‘What have I done to deserve this? Why is everyone ignoring me?’\n\nHe burst into tears and was still sobbing when several guards with yellow scarves round their heads came running towards him brandishing whips.\n\n‘Who is this man?’ they cried. ‘How dare he intrude upon this heavenly paradise! Be off with you!’\n\nPao-yu was too frightened to say a word. He was searching for a way out when he saw in the distance a group of ladies approaching, laughing and talking among themselves.\n\n‘They look like Ying-chun and the others!’ he thought to himself with a surge of joy. ‘They’ve come to rescue me! I’m lost! Help!’\n\nHe was still calling out when the guards came after him again. He began running frantically, and suddenly the ladies too changed into demons and came pursuing after him.\n\nPao-yu was in despair, when the monk who had brought him the jade suddenly appeared, holding a mirror in his hand.\n\n‘I am here by order of Her Grace the Imperial Consort,’ declared the monk, ‘to save you!’\n\nHe held up the mirror, and the demons vanished, leaving Pao-yu alone in a desolate stretch of open country. He seized hold of the monk.\n\n‘I remember you,’ he said. ‘You brought me here, and then you disappeared. I’ve been having the most terrible hallucinations. I want to go home, but I’ve lost my way.’\n\nAfterwards he saw a number of his family, but they all ignored him and suddenly turned into fiends and ghosts. Was it a dream or was it real? I beg you, reverend sir, to enlighten me.”\n\n“While you were there,” asked the monk, “did you peep at anything?”\n\nBaoyu reflected that since the monk had been able to take him to that fairyland, he must be supernatural too and could not be deceived. Besides, he was anxious to have this explained.\n\n“Yes, I saw a number of registers,” he admitted.\n\n“There you are!” cried the monk. “Having seen the registers, don’t you understand yet? All mortal attachments are due to devilish influences. Just remember carefully all that happened to you. Some other day I shall explain.” With that he gave Baoyu a shove and cried, “Back you go!”\n\nBaoyu, losing his balance, fell with a cry of dismay.\n\nHis family, waiting by his bedside in tears, hearing this cry hurriedly called to him. Opening his eyes, Baoyu saw that he was still lying on the kang, with Lady Wang and Baochai weeping, their eyes swollen. Collecting his thoughts, he said to himself, “Yes, I have been dead.” He then proceeded to recall all that his spirit had experienced, and luckily he could remember most of it.\n\n“So that’s how it was!” he chuckled.\n\nLady Wang, thinking this a return of his madness, sent maids and nurses at once to inform Jia Zheng that Baoyu had come round, but that he was deranged again. However, since he was able to talk they need not make funeral preparations.\n\nJia Zheng came in at once to see for himself, and was relieved to find Baoyu conscious again.\n\n“You wretched, unlucky boy!” he scolded. “Frightening your parents like this!” In spite of himself, tears ran down his cheeks. He sighed, then went out to send for a doctor to feel the invalid’s pulse and prescribe medicine.\n\nSheyue, on the point of killing herself, was reassured by Baoyu’s recovery. Lady Wang told the maids to give him some longan broth, and after sipping a few mouthfuls he gradually calmed down. His mother and the others, much relieved, did not scold Sheyue but simply told them to give the jade to Baochai to put round his neck for him.\n\nThen, recalling the strange monk, Lady Wang remarked, “It’s odd — where did that jade come from? And how strange that one moment he wanted money, the next he’d disappeared! Could he have been an immortal?”\n\n“Judging by the way that monk came and went,” said Baochai, “the jade wasn’t found by him. I suspect that when it was lost, he took it.”\n\n“But the jade was at home, how could he take it?” “Since he could bring it, he could take it away,” countered Baochai.\n\nXiren and Sheyue put in, “The year that jade was lost, Master Lin told our fortune by characters, and after you came into the family, madam, we told you that the character he used was shang ‘reward’. Do you remember?”\n\nBaochai thought this over and said, “Yes. You said that character meant that the jade had been taken to a pawnshop. Now I understand: the top of the character is xiao ‘small’ and the bottom is kou ‘mouth’ — that doesn’t make shang; but if the top is shang ‘still’ and the bottom is bei ‘cloth’, that makes the shang of heshang ‘monk’. So a monk must have taken it.”\n\n“That monk was certainly strange!” exclaimed Lady Wang. “The year Baoyu was ill, he came and said that we had a treasure which could cure him — meaning this jade. Since he knew that, of course there’s something special about it. And your husband was born with it in his mouth. Did you ever hear of another such case since time began? But we don’t know what will become of this jade in the end, or of him either. This jade has been the cause of his illness and of his recovery, as well as of his birth....” She broke off and could not hold back her tears.\n\nBaoyu, who understood, said nothing but thought over his dream carefully.\n\nAt that point Xichun remarked, “The year Baoyu lost his jade, Miaoyu was invited to summon an immortal, who said, ‘At the foot of Blue Ridge Peak he leans against an ancient pine,’ and also, ‘If you would enter the gate, then with a smile you meet.’ Now that I think of it, those words ‘enter the gate’ are highly significant. The greatest of all gates is the Buddhist dharma gate — but I’m afraid Cousin Baoyu will never be able to enter it.” Baoyu laughed scornfully when he heard this. Baochai knitted her brows and stared blankly before her.\n\n“There you go again, talking about Buddhism,” said Madam You. “Haven’t you given up yet the idea of becoming a nun?”\n\n“I don’t mind telling you, sister-in-law, I’ve long since given up eating meat,” replied Xichun.\n\n“Good for you, child! Amida Buddha!” exclaimed Lady Wang. “But you mustn’t have such an idea.”\n\nXichun said nothing. Baoyu, thinking of the line “By an ancient Buddha’s dim lamplight,” could not help sighing. Then another line flashed into his mind: “A mat on the ground, a single flower,” and his eyes turned towards Xiren. Tears ran down his cheeks. The others were puzzled by his sudden changes from laughter to sadness, and put it down to his old illness. They did not know that the sight of different things had awakened his memory, enabling him to recall the verses he had stealthily read in the Register of the Fair and Unfortunate. He kept this to himself, however, having already made up his mind. But no more of this.\n\nWhen the others saw that Baoyu had come back to life and was clear-headed again, besides taking medicine daily and steadily improving till he was almost his old self, Jia Zheng was relieved of anxiety. Now that he was in mourning and had no official duties, he reflected that there was no knowing when Jia She would be pardoned, and he was uneasy at leaving the Lady Dowager’s coffin so long in the temple. He decided to have it taken south for burial, and sent for Jia Lian to discuss this.\n\n“An excellent idea, uncle,” said Jia Lian. “It would be best to do this while you’re in mourning. Once the mourning is over, you may not be able to get away. But as my father’s away from home, I don’t like to take decisions. Your plan is excellent, but it will cost several thousand taels. We’ll never raise that sum from the yamen’s seizure of our property.”\n\n“I’ve made up my mind,” replied Jia Zheng. “But as the Elder Master isn’t at home, I wanted to consult you. Since you can’t leave, and we’ve no one else to send, how am I to manage all the coffins by myself? I thought of taking Rong along, as his wife’s coffin is to be taken back too; and there’s also your Cousin Lin’s. The old lady’s instructions were that she should go back with her. I think we shall have to borrow several thousand taels for the trip, that’s all.”\n\n“People are very cold-hearted these days,” said Jia Lian. “You’re in mourning, uncle, and my father’s away. There’s no one we can borrow from. We shall have to mortgage our title-deeds for a loan.”\n\n“These houses were built with official funds; we can’t dispose of them.”\n\n“No, not the houses we live in. But we can sell some others outside, and redeem them after you resume office. If my father comes back and is reinstated too, that will be fine. We’re only sorry, uncle, that at your age you should have to undertake such a tiring journey.”\n\n“It’s my duty to see to the old lady’s funeral. So long as you keep things going properly here, that’s all right.”\n\n“Set your mind at rest, uncle. Stupid as I am, of course I shall do my best. Besides, when you go south you’ll be taking plenty of staff, so not many will be left here; and we can manage our expenses. If you run short on the way, you’ll be passing Lai Shangrong’s place and can get him to help out.”\n\n“The expenses for my own mother’s funeral — how can I ask someone else to help?”\n\n“Very well,” replied Jia Lian, withdrawing to see about raising the money.\n\nJia Zheng told Lady Wang to take charge of the household while he chose a day to start the journey with the coffin. Baoyu had now recovered his health, and both Jia Huan and Jia Lan were studying hard. Jia Zheng entrusted the whole household to Jia Lian with orders to keep an eye on them.\n\n“This is the year for the Palace Examination,” he said. “Huan can’t take it as he’s in mourning; but Lan, being a grandson, can after the mourning’s over. Be sure to send Baoyu and his nephew to take the examination. If one of them can become a Provincial Graduate, that will atone for our faults.” Jia Lian assented meekly to all his instructions.\n\nHaving given his orders to those who were to stay at home and said much more, Jia Zheng took his leave of the family shrine. Then after several days’ devotions outside the city, the coffin was embarked and he set off with Lin Zhixiao and the rest. None of their relatives or friends were notified, only the men and women of the house saw them off and then returned.\n\nBecause Jia Zheng had ordered Baoyu to take the examination, Lady Wang kept urging him to study and testing him on his lessons. And Baochai and Xiren, needless to say, gave him constant encouragement. But after his illness, although Baoyu’s mind was clearer his ideas had become so eccentric that he was a changed man. He had lost interest not only in official advancement but even in the romance between the sexes. However, as the others were unaware of this he kept it to himself.\n\nOne day, Zijuan came back after seeing Daiyu’s coffin off and sat dejectedly crying in her room.\n\n“How heartless Baoyu is!” she thought. “He didn’t shed a single tear at the sight of his cousin’s coffin, and when he sees me sobbing my heart out he doesn’t try to comfort me, just stares at me and smiles. All his honeyed words in the past were meant to fool us. Luckily I saw through him the other night, or I might have been taken in again! But there’s one thing I can’t figure out. Nowadays he seems cold even to Xiren. And though the young mistress never cared for demonstrativeness, don’t Sheyue and the others complain? Most girls are too gullible. All the anxiety we’ve been through will come to nothing — who knows what the end will be?”\n\nShe was thinking this when Wu’er came in to see her. Noticing that Zijuan’s face was streaked with tears, she said, “Are you crying again for Miss Lin, sister? I think, where men are concerned, seeing is believing. I’d always heard that Master Bao was especially good to girls, and that’s why my mother took so much trouble to get me into the Garden. But since coming here, though I’ve waited on him several times when he was ill and done my very best, now that he’s better he hasn’t a single kind word for me; in fact, he won’t even look at me properly.”\n\nZijuan could not help smiling at this.\n\n“You silly thing!” she cried. “What do you want him to do for you? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, a girl, talking such nonsense? He has a wife and two concubines now, but he pays no attention to any of them — why should he have time for you?” Teasingly she pointed one finger at Wu’er. “Tell me, what relation are you to him?”\n\nThis made Wu’er blush to the roots of her hair. She was trying to explain that she had not meant that Baoyu should be attentive to her, only that recently he seemed indifferent to everyone, when confused shouting was heard outside.\n\n“That monk is here again,” people were yelling. “He’s demanding that ten thousand taels of silver! Her Ladyship is frantic. She’s sent for Master Lian to talk to him, but he’s not at home. The monk is raving madly out there. Her Ladyship wants Madam Lian to go and discuss what to do.”\n\nIf you want to know how they got rid of the monk, read the next chapter."
