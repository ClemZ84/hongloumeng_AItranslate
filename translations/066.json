  "original": "话说兴儿说怕吹倒了林姑娘，吹化了薛姑娘，大家都笑了。那鲍二家的打他一下子，笑道：“原有些真，到了你嘴里，越发没了捆儿了。你倒不象跟二爷的人，这些话倒象是宝玉的人。”尤二姐才要又问，忽见尤三姐笑问道：“可是，你们家那宝玉，除了上学他做些什么？”兴儿笑道：“三姨儿别问他。说起来，三姨儿也未必信。他长了这么大，独他没有上过正经学。我们家从祖宗直到二爷，谁不是学里的师老爷严严的管着念书？偏他不爱念书，是老太太的宝贝。老爷先还管，如今也不敢管了。成天家疯疯癫癫的，说话人也不懂，干的事人也不知。外头人人看着好清俊模样儿，心里自然是聪明的，谁知里头更糊涂。见了人，一句话也没有。所有的好处，虽没上过学，倒难为他认得几个字。每日又不习文，又不学武，又怕见人，只爱在丫头群儿里闹。再者，也没个刚气儿。有一遭见了我们，喜欢时没上没下，大家乱玩一阵，不喜欢各自走了，他也不理人。我们坐着卧着，见了他也不理他，他也不责备。因此，没人怕他，只管随便，都过的去。”尤三姐笑道：“主子宽了，你们又这样；严了，又抱怨，可知你们难缠。”尤二姐道：“我们看他倒好，原来这样。可惜了儿的一个好胎子！”尤三姐道：“姐姐信他胡说？咱们也不是见过一面两面的，行事言谈吃喝，原有些女儿气的，自然是天天只在里头惯了的。要说糊涂，那些儿糊涂？姐姐记得穿孝时，咱们同在一处，那日正是和尚们进来绕棺，咱们都在那里站着，他只站在头里挡着人。人说他不知礼，又没眼色。过后他没悄悄的告诉咱们说？‘姐姐们不知道，我并不是没眼色，想和尚们的那样腌，只恐怕气味熏了姐姐们。’接着他吃茶，姐姐又要茶，那个老婆子就拿了他的碗去倒，他赶忙说：‘那碗是腌的，另洗了再斟来。’这两件上，我冷眼看去，原来他在女孩儿跟前，不管什么都过的去，只不大合外人的式，所以他们不知道。”尤二姐听说，笑道：“依你说，你两个已是情投意合了。竟把你许了他岂不好？”三姐见有兴儿，不便说话，只低了头磕瓜子儿。兴儿笑道：“若论模样儿行为，倒是一对儿好人。只是他已经有了人了，只是没有露形儿，将来准是林姑娘定了的。因林姑娘多病，二则都还小，所以还没办呢。再过三二年，老太太便一开言，那是再无不准的了。”大家正说话，只见隆儿又来了，说：“老爷有事，是件机密大事，要遣二爷往平安州去。不过三五日就起身，来回得十五六天的工夫。今儿不能来了，请老奶奶早和二姨儿定了那件事，明日爷来好做定夺。”说着带了兴儿，也回去了。\n　　这里尤二姐命掩了门，早睡下了，盘问他妹子一夜。至次日午后贾琏方来了，尤二姐因劝他，说：“既有正事，何必忙忙又来？千万别为我误事。”贾琏道：“也没什么事，只是偏偏的又出来了一件远差。出了月儿就起身，得半月工夫才来。”尤二姐道：“既如此，你只管放心前去，这里一应不用你惦记。三妹妹他从不会朝更暮改的。他已择定了人，你只要依他就是了。”贾琏忙问：“是谁？”二姐笑道：“这人此刻不在这里，不知多早晚才来呢。也难为他的眼力。他自己说了：这人一年不来，他等一年；十年不来，等十年。若这人死了，再不来了，他情愿剃了头当姑子去，吃常念佛，再不嫁人。”贾琏问：“到底是谁，这样动他的心？”二姐儿笑道：“说来话长。五年前，我们老娘家做生日，妈妈和我们到那里给老娘拜寿，他家请了一起玩戏的人，也都是好人家子弟。里头有个装小生的，叫做柳湘莲。如今要是他才嫁。旧年闻得这人惹了祸逃走了，不知回来了不曾。”贾琏听了道：“怪道呢，我说是个什么人，原来是他。果然眼力不错。你不知道那柳老二那样一个标致人，最是冷面冷心的，差不多的人，他都无情无义。他最和宝玉合的来。去年因打了薛呆子，他不好意思见我们的，不知那里去了，一向没来。听见有人说来了，不知是真是假，一问宝玉小厮们，就知道了。倘或不来时，他是萍踪浪迹，知道几年才来？岂不白耽搁了大事？”二姐道：“我们这三丫头，说的出来干的出来，他怎么说，只依他便了。”\n　　二人正说之间，只见三姐走来说道：“姐夫，你也不知道我们是什么人。今日和你说罢，你只放心，我们不是那心口两样的人，说什么是什么。若有了姓柳的来，我便嫁他。从今儿起，我吃常斋念佛，伏侍母亲，等来了嫁了他去；若一百年不来，我自己修行去了。”说着将头上一根玉簪拔下来，磕作两段，说：“一句不真，就合这簪子一样！”说着，回房去了，真个竟“非礼不动，非礼不言”起来。贾琏无了法，只得和二姐商议了一回家务，复回家和凤姐商议起身之事。一面着人问焙茗。焙茗说：“竟不知道。大约没来，若来了，必是我知道的。”一面又问他的街坊，也说没来。贾琏只得回复了二姐儿。\n　　至起身之日已近，前两天便说起身，却先往二姐儿这边来住两夜，从这里再悄悄的长行。果见三姐儿竟象又换了一个人的似的。又见二姐儿持家勤慎，自是不消惦记。是日，一早出城，竟奔平安州大道，晓行夜住，渴饮饥餐。方走了三日，那日正走之间，顶头来了一群驮子，内中一伙，主仆十来匹马。走的近了，一看时，不是别人，就是薛蟠和柳湘莲来了。贾琏深为奇怪，忙拍马迎了上来，大家一齐相见。说些别后寒温，便入一酒店歇下，共叙谈叙谈。贾琏因笑道：“闹过之后，我们忙着请你两个和解，谁知柳二弟踪迹全无。怎么你们两个今日倒在一处了？”薛蟠笑道：“天下竟有这样奇事：我和伙计贩了货物，自春天起身，往回里走，一路平安。谁知前儿到了平安州地面。遇见一伙强盗，已将东西劫去。不想柳二弟从那边来了，方把贼人赶散，夺回货物，还救了我们的性命。我谢他又不受，所以我们结拜了生死兄弟，如今一路进京。从此后，我们是亲弟兄一般。到前面岔口上分路，他就分路往南二百里，有他一个姑妈家，他去望候望候。我先进京去安置了我的事，然后给他寻一所房子，寻一门好亲事，大家过起来。”贾琏听了道：“原来如此！倒好，只是我们白悬了几日心。”因又说道：“方才说给柳二弟提亲，我正有一门好亲事，堪配二弟。”说着，便将自己娶尤氏，如今又要发嫁小姨子一节，说了出来，只不说尤三姐自择之语。又嘱薛蟠：“且不可告诉家里。等生了儿子，自然是知道的。”薛蟠听了大喜，说：“早该如此。这都是舍表妹之过。”湘莲忙笑道：“你又忘情了，还不住口。”薛播忙止住不语，便说：“既是这等，这门亲事定要做的。”湘莲道：“我本有愿，定要一个绝色的女子。\n如今既是贵昆仲高谊，顾不得许多了，任凭定夺，我无不从命。”贾琏笑道：“如今口说无凭，等柳二弟一见，便知我这内娣的品貌，是古今有一无二的了。”湘莲听了大喜，说：“既如此说，等弟探过姑母，不过一月内，就进京的，那时再定如何？”贾琏笑道：“你我一言为定。只是我信不过二弟，你是萍踪浪迹，倘然去了不来，岂不误了人家一辈子的大事？须得留一个定礼。”湘莲道：“大丈夫岂有失信之理？小弟素系寒贫，况且在客中，那里能有定礼？”薛蟠道：“我这里现成，就备一分，二哥带去。”贾琏道：“也不用金银珠宝，须是二弟亲身自有的东西，不论贵贱，不过带去取信耳。”湘莲道：“既如此说，弟无别物，囊中还有一把‘鸳鸯剑’，乃弟家中传代之宝，弟也不敢擅用，只是随身收藏着，二哥就请拿去为定。弟纵系水流花落之性，亦断不舍此剑。”说毕，大家又饮了几杯，方各自上马，作别起程了。\n　　且说贾琏一日到平安州，见了节度，完了公事，因又嘱咐他十月前后务要还来一次。贾琏领命，次日连忙取路回家，先到尤二姐那边。且说二姐儿操持家务，十分谨肃，每日关门闭户，一点外事不闻。那三姐儿果是个斩钉截铁之人，每日侍奉母亲之馀，只和姐姐一处做些活计。虽贾珍趁贾琏不在家，也来鬼混了两次，无奈二姐儿只不兜揽，推故不见。那三姐儿的脾气，贾珍早已领过教的，那里还敢招惹他去？所以踪迹一发疏阔了。却说这日贾琏进门，看见二姐儿三姐儿这般景况，喜之不尽，深念二姐儿之德。大家叙些寒温，贾琏便将路遇柳湘莲一事说了一回，又将鸳鸯剑取出递给三姐儿。三姐儿看时，上面龙吞夔护，珠宝晶莹；及至拿出来看时，里面却是两把合体的，一把上面錾一“鸳”字，一把上面錾一“鸯”字，冷飕飕，明亮亮，如两痕秋水一般。三姐儿喜出望外，连忙收了，挂在自己绣房床上，每日望着剑，自喜终身有靠。贾琏住了两天，回去复了父命，回家合宅相见。那时凤姐已大愈，出来理事行走了。贾琏又将此事告诉了贾珍。贾珍因近日又搭上了新相知，二则正恼他姐妹们无情，把这事丢过了，全不在心上，任凭贾琏裁夺；只怕贾琏独力不能，少不得又给他几十两银子。贾琏拿来，交给二姐儿，预备妆奁。\n　　谁知八月内湘莲方进了京，先来拜见薛姨妈。又遇见薛蟠，方知薛蟠不惯风霜，不服水土，一进京时，便病倒在家，请医调治。听见湘莲来了，请入卧室相见。薛姨妈也不念旧事，只感救命之恩。母子们十分称谢。又说起亲事一节，凡一应东西皆置办妥当，只等择日。湘莲也感激不尽。\n　　次日，又来见宝玉。二人相会，如鱼得水。湘莲因问贾琏偷娶二房之事。宝玉笑道：“我听见焙茗说，我却未见。我也不敢多管。我又听见焙茗说，琏二哥哥着实问你。不知有何话说？”湘莲就将路上所有之事，一概告诉了宝玉。宝玉笑道：“大喜，大喜！难得这个标致人！果然是个古今绝色，堪配你之为人。”湘莲道：“既是这样，他那少了人物？如何只想到我？况且我又素日不甚和他相厚，也关切不至于此。路上忙忙的就那样再三要求定下，难道女家反赶着男家不成？我自己疑惑起来，后悔不该留下这剑作定。所以后来想起你来，可以细细问了底里才好。”宝玉道：“你原是个精细人，如何既许了定礼又疑惑起来？你原说只要一个绝色的。如今既得了个绝色的，便罢了，何必再疑？”湘莲道：“你既不知他来历，如何又知是绝色？”宝玉道：“他是珍大嫂子的继母带来的两位妹子。我在那里和他们混了一个月，怎么不知？真真一对尤物！他又姓尤。”湘莲听了，跌脚道：“这事不好！断乎做不得。你们东府里，除了那两个石头狮子干净罢了。”宝玉听说，红了脸。湘莲自惭失言，连忙作揖，说：“我该死，胡说。你好歹告诉我，他品行如何？”宝玉笑道：“你既深知，又来问我做甚么？连我也未必干净了。”湘莲笑道：“原是我自己一时忘情，好歹别多心。”宝玉笑道：“何必再提，这倒似有心了。”\n　　湘莲作揖告辞出来，心中想着要找薛蟠，一则他病着，二则他又浮躁，不如去要回定礼。主意已定，便一径来找贾琏。贾琏正在新房中，闻湘莲来了，喜之不尽，忙迎出来，让在内堂，尤老娘相见。湘莲只作揖，称“老伯母”，自称“晚生”，贾琏听了诧异。吃茶之间，湘莲便说：“客中偶然忙促，谁知家姑母于四月订了弟妇，使弟无言可回。要从了二哥背了姑母，似不合理。若系金帛之定，弟不敢索取；但此剑系祖父所遗，请仍赐回为幸。”贾琏听了，心中自是不自在，便道：“二弟，这话你说错了。定者，定也，原怕返悔，所以为定。岂有婚姻之事，出入随意的？这个断乎使不得。”湘莲笑说：“如此说，弟愿领责备罚，然此事断不敢从命。”贾琏还要绕舌。湘莲便起身说：“请兄外座一叙，此处不便。”\n　　那尤三姐在房明明听见。好容易等了他来，今忽见返悔，便知他在贾府中听了什么话来，把自己也当做淫奔无耻之流，不屑为妻。今若容他出去和贾琏说退亲，料那贾琏不但无法可处，就是争辩起来，自己也无趣味。一听贾琏要同他出去，连忙摘下剑来，将一股雌锋隐在肘后，出来便说：“你们也不必出去再议，还你的定礼！”一面泪如雨下，左手将剑并鞘送给湘莲，右手回肘，只往项上一横。可怜：揉碎桃花红满地，玉山倾倒再难扶！\n　　当下唬的众人急救不迭。尤老娘一面嚎哭，一面大骂湘莲。贾琏揪住湘莲，命人捆了送官。二姐儿忙止泪，反劝贾琏：“人家并没威逼他，是他自寻短见，你便送他到官，又有何益？反觉生事出丑。不如放他去罢。”贾琏此时也没了主意，便放了手，命湘莲快去。湘莲反不动身，拉下手绢，拭泪道：“我并不知是这等刚烈人。真真可敬！是我没福消受。”大哭一场，等买了棺木，眼看着入殓，又抚棺大哭一场，方告辞而去。\n出门正无所之，昏昏默默，自想方才之事：“原来这样标致人才，又这等刚烈！”自悔不及，信步行来，也不自知了。正走之间，只听得隐隐一阵环佩之声，三姐从那边来了，一手捧着鸳鸯剑，一手捧着一卷册子，向湘莲哭道：“妾痴情待君五年，不期君果冷心冷面。妾以死报此痴情。妾今奉警幻仙姑之命，前往太虚幻境，修注案中所有一干情鬼。妾不忍相别，故来一会，从此再不能相见矣！”说毕，又向湘莲洒了几点眼泪，便要告辞而行。湘莲不舍，连忙欲上来拉住问时，那三姐一摔手，便自去了。这里柳湘莲放声大哭，不觉处梦中哭醒，似梦非梦，睁眼看时，竟是一座破庙，旁边坐着一个瘸腿道士捕虱。湘莲便起身稽首相问：“此系何方？仙师何号？”道士笑道：“连我也不知道此系何方，我系何人。不过暂来歇脚而已。”湘莲听了，冷然如寒冰侵骨。掣出那股雄剑来，将万根烦恼丝，一挥而尽，便随那道士，不知往那里去了。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Xing’er’s remark that a gust of wind might blow Miss Lin away or melt Miss Xue made them all laugh. Mrs. Bao slapped him.\n\n“There may be some truth in that,” she cried, “but the way you put it, it’s downright libel. You don’t sound like Lord Lian’s servant — more like one of Baoyu’s.”\n\nWhen Second Sister You was about to question him further, Third Sister asked with a smile, “What does your Master Bao do apart from studying?”\n\n“Don’t ask me about him, miss. If I tell you, you may not believe me. Fancy a young gentleman of his age never having been to school properly! All the masters of our house, from the founder of the family down to the present Second Master, have had strict tutors to make them study. But he’s the old lady’s darling and has never liked studying. At first his father tried to make him, but he doesn’t dare now. He spends the time fooling about all day, talking in a way nobody can understand and doing things nobody can make out. He may look handsome and have good sense — in fact he seems a very clever young gentleman — yet actually he’s simpleminded. He never says a proper word to people but makes himself so agreeable, you’d think he was a girl himself instead of a boy. Though he’s never been to school he’s managed to learn a few characters, for what they’re worth. He doesn’t practise the martial arts either, or study the classics; and he’s so scared of seeing strangers he has no manners. All he likes is to fool about with the maids. And he hasn’t a spark of dignity. When he runs into us, if he’s in good mood he’ll joke with us without any respect, high or low; if he’s in a bad mood, he just ignores us. We can sit or lie down in his presence and take no notice of him, and he doesn’t mind a bit. So nobody’s afraid of him. We just do as we please in his presence.”\n\n“If your masters are easy on you, you take liberties; if they’re strict, you complain,” observed Third Sister. “What a nuisance you are!”\n\n“We thought he was a nice young gentleman,” said Second Sister. “What a pity he’s like that!”\n\n“Don’t believe that nonsense, sister,” retorted Third Sister. “We’ve seen him more than once or twice. In his behaviour, talk and general manner he has something of a girl’s delicacy, which comes of being bred up among girls. But in what way is he simpleminded? Do you remember that time during the mourning when we were all together? The monks had come in to circle the coffin, and we were standing there when he planted himself in front to screen us. People said he had no manners and wasn’t observant. But didn’t he tell us afterwards in secret, ‘Sisters, you don’t realize that those monks are so dirty, I was afraid the smell might offend you.’ Then when he was drinking tea and you asked for some, sister, that old woman took his bowl to pour you one, but he stopped her, saying, ‘That bowl’s dirty.’ After watching him in these two instances, I came to the conclusion that he treats girls with the greatest consideration. It’s just that his ways don’t suit conventional outsiders, who can’t understand him.”\n\nSecond Sister laughed.\n\n“From the way you talk, the two of you must be kindred spirits. Why don’t we arrange for you to marry him?”\n\nAs Xing’er was present, Third Sister simply lowered her head and cracked melon-seeds with her teeth.\n\n“They’d make a handsome couple as far as looks and behaviour go,” put in Xing’er. “But he’s already got someone in mind, though nothing’s been said about it openly yet. And it’s sure to be Miss Lin. Because she’s always ill and they’re both still young, the matter hasn’t been settled. But in another couple of years, when the old lady speaks of it, there’ll be no question but that it will be fixed up.”\n\nAs they were chatting, Long’er arrived.\n\n“The master has some business, an important confidential matter, and he’s sending the Second Master to Pinganzhou,” he announced. “He’ll be leaving in a few days and will be gone a fortnight. He can’t come today, but he asks you, madam, to settle that business with Second Sister. Then when he calls tomorrow he’ll make the decision.” With that he took Xing’er away with him.\n\nThen Second Sister had the gate closed and went to bed early, keeping her sister company while she questioned her all night. The next day Jia Lian did not come until the afternoon.\n\nSecond Sister urged him, \"If you have business to attend to, why rush back here? On no account neglect your duties for my sake.\"\n\n\"It's nothing much,\" he said. \"But another trip has just cropped up, a long one this time. I shall have to leave at the beginning of next month and be away a fortnight.\"\n\n\"In that case, don't worry but go ahead. There's nothing here for you to worry about. My younger sister's not one to keep changing her mind. She's chosen her future husband and you must let her have her way.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"The man's not here at present,\" she said with a smile. \"There's no knowing when he'll come. But she certainly has good taste. She says she'll wait one year for him if necessary, or ten years. If he dies and can't come, she'll shave off her hair and become a nun, chanting Buddha's name all day and never marrying another man.\"\n\n\"Who can it be that she's so set on?\"\n\n\"It's a long story. Five years ago, on our grandmother's birthday, mother took us there to offer congratulations. The family had hired some players, all from good families, and one of them who played young lovers' roles was called Liu Xianglian. She'll only marry him. Last year we heard that he got into some trouble and ran away; we don't know whether he's back or not.\"\n\n\"Is that the way of it?\" exclaimed Jia Lian. \"I was wondering who it could be. So it's him! She certainly has good taste. But let me tell you, this Liu Xianglian may be a handsome fellow, he's cold as ice and hard as iron. He shows no mercy to nearly everyone. He gets on best with Baoyu. Last year, after giving that fool Xue Pan a thrashing, he was too ashamed to see us and went off no one knows where. He hasn't been back since. I did hear that he'd returned, but I don't know whether it's true or not. If you ask Baoyu's pages they'll know. If he's not back, he's a rolling stone and there's no knowing when he'll return. Wouldn't that delay your sister's marriage?\"\n\n\"Our Third Sister means what she says,\" replied Second Sister. \"She'll do as she says. We must just let her have her way.\"\n\nAs they were talking Third Sister joined them and said to Jia Lian, \"You don't know what sort of people we are, brother-in-law. Well, let me tell you. Don't worry. We're not double-tongued or double-hearted. We mean what we say. If Mr. Liu comes, I'll marry him. If not, I'll never marry anyone else. From today on, I shall fast and chant Buddha's name to wait on my mother till he comes; and if he doesn't come in a hundred years, I shall become a nun.\" She drew a jade pin from her hair and broke it in two, crying, \"If there's a single word of falsehood in this, may I be like this pin!\" With that she withdrew to her room.\n\nIndeed, from that day on she never said or did anything improper. Jia Lian could think of no way to handle her. He simply discussed some domestic matters with Second Sister, then went home to tell Xifeng about his impending trip and send to ask Mingyan if Liu Xianglian had come back.\n\nMingyan said, \"I don't know. Probably not. If he had, I'd be sure to know.\"\n\nJia Lian also asked some of the neighbours, but they too said Liu had not come back. So he had to report this to Second Sister.\n\nAs the day for his departure drew near, two days in advance of his official departure he spent two nights with Second Sister, planning to set out quietly from there. He found Third Sister a completely changed person, and as Second Sister was managing the household so well he had nothing to worry about. The day he left, he went out of the city at dawn and took the high road to Ping'an Zhou. He travelled by day and rested by night, eating and drinking when hungry or thirsty. Three days later, he encountered a train of mules and in the party a master\n\nA dozen horsemen rode up and at their head Jia Lian recognized Xue Pan and Liu Xianglian. He was most surprised. Riding forward to meet them, he exchanged greetings and after the usual polite inquiries about their health since their last parting, they dismounted and went into a tavern to talk.\n\n“After that rumpus we were busy trying to arrange a reconciliation,” said Jia Lian. “But then Brother Liu disappeared. How is it that the two of you are together now?”\n\n“The most amazing thing!” Xue Pan chuckled. “I left with some of our assistants in the spring with a consignment of goods, and all the way there and back we had no trouble. But the day before yesterday, in the district of Pingan, we ran into a band of brigands who robbed us of our goods. Then out of the blue Brother Liu turned up, put the robbers to flight, got back our goods and saved our lives too. When I offered him a reward he wouldn’t take it, so we’ve sworn brotherhood and are on our way now to the capital together. From now on we’re going to be like real brothers. When we come to a fork in the road ahead, he’s taking the southern branch to pay a visit to an aunt of his who lives two hundred li away, while I go on first to the capital to see to my business. Then I’ll find him a house and a good wife so that we can settle down.”\n\n“So that’s how it was!” exclaimed Jia Lian. “Splendid! But we were needlessly worried on your account. Speaking of a good wife for Brother Liu, I know of a fine family with a girl who’d be just the match for him.”\n\nHe described his own marriage to Second Sister You and his present plan to find a husband for her younger sister, omitting to mention that Third Sister had chosen for herself.\n\n“Mind you don’t breathe a word of this at home,” he cautioned. “They’ll know soon enough when she has a son.”\n\nXue Pan was overjoyed.\n\n“That’s fine,” he cried. “It’s all my cousin’s fault.”\n\n“There you go again!” Xianglian warned him laughingly. “Shut up!”\n\nXue Pan stopped short.\n\n“In that case this match must be arranged,” he said.\n\n“I’ve always been determined to marry an incomparable beauty,” put in Xianglian. “But now that you two good brothers show such concern for me, I can’t insist on that. I’ll leave it to you to decide and will do whatever you say.”\n\n“My word may not be enough for you,” said Jia Lian. “But once you see my sister-in-law, you’ll realize that her beauty is absolutely unparalleled.”\n\nXianglian was delighted.\n\n“In that case, as soon as I’ve visited my aunt — in less than a month I’ll be back in the capital — we can fix it up. How about that?”\n\n“Your word is good enough for me,” replied Jia Lian. “But I’m not sure of you. You’re a wanderer. If you go off and never come back, wouldn’t that spoil the girl’s whole life? You must leave us some token.”\n\n“How can a true man break his word?” demanded Xianglian. “But I’ve always been hard up, and now that I’m travelling how can I provide a token?”\n\n“I can fix that,” offered Xue Pan. “I’ve the means here to prepare one for you to leave, brother.”\n\n“It doesn’t have to be gold or jewels, just some personal possession of yours, no matter how trifling, to serve as a pledge.”\n\n“In that case, I have nothing with me except the pair of Mandarin Duck swords which are an heirloom in my family. I daren’t use them, just carry them with me. You had better take them, brother, as my pledge. Flighty as I am, I’d never give up these swords.”\n\nThey drank a few more cups of wine then mounted their horses and went their different ways.\n\nJia Lian, having reached Pingan and completed his business there with the military governor, who asked him to return in the tenth month, lost no time in going back. He went first to see Second Sister. He found her managing the household in a most exemplary way, keeping the gate closed and having no outside dealings.\n\nBut Sanjie was a girl of iron will. Apart from waiting on her mother, all she did was work with her sister. Although Jia Zhen took advantage of Jia Lian’s absence to slip over and fool around with them a couple of times, Erjie would have nothing to do with him and made excuses not to see him. And as Jia Zhen already knew Sanjie’s temper, he dared not provoke her either. So his visits became few and far between.\n\nWhen Jia Lian came home and saw how well the two sisters were doing he was overjoyed and deeply impressed by Erjie’s virtue. After an exchange of greetings he described his meeting with Liu Xianglian and produced the duck-and-drake swords to give to Sanjie. These were ornamented with a dragon and a monster, and set with glittering gems. When she drew them out of their sheath, the two blades which fitted together were inscribed “duck” and “drake.” They were as cold as ice and as bright as a stream in autumn. Delighted, she lost no time in hanging them on the bed in her room, gazing at them day after day in the glad belief that her future was assured.\n\nJia Lian stayed two days before going back to report to his father, then returned home to see the whole household. By now Xifeng had largely recovered and was attending to household business again. He told Jia Zhen about his mission. But Jia Zhen, who had recently found a new fancy and was vexed by the two sisters’ indifference, was quite indifferent himself and left the whole matter to Jia Lian, simply giving him a few dozen taels in case he needed more money. Jia Lian took this to Erjie to help pay for her trousseau.\n\nIn the eighth month Xianglian reached the capital and called first on Aunt Xue, then met Xue Pan who told him how, being unused to exposure and a change of climate, he had fallen ill on reaching home and doctors had been called in. At news of Xianglian’s arrival he asked to see him in his bedroom, and Aunt Xue too, forgetting the past, was very grateful to him for saving her son’s life. Mother and son thanked him profusely. When they spoke of his engagement and told him that all the wedding preparations were ready, waiting only for the selection of an auspicious day, Xianglian expressed deep gratitude.\n\nThe next day he called on Baoyu. Their meeting was joyful to both. Xianglian asked about Jia Lian’s secret second marriage.\n\n“I heard about it from Beiming but didn’t see it for myself,” said Baoyu with a smile. “I didn’t like to poke my nose into other people’s business. But Beiming told me how anxiously my Second Brother Jia Lian kept asking after you. What did he want to say to you?”\n\nXianglian told him all that had happened on the road.\n\n“Congratulations!” cried Baoyu. “She’s a stunning beauty, the perfect match for you.”\n\n“In that case, why should he have to look so far afield? Why pick on me? Besides, we’ve never been close friends; he couldn’t be so concerned on my account. Why should he be in such a hurry to arrange the match on the journey? Isn’t that rather pushing it? That makes me suspicious. I’m sorry I left those swords with them as a pledge. It struck me later that you’re the one to ask for the low-down on this girl.”\n\n“You’re such a smart chap, how can you have doubts after giving the betrothal present? You always said you wanted an absolutely ravishing girl, and now you’ve got one, why be so suspicious?”\n\n“How do you know she’s so ravishing if you don’t know her background?”\n\n“She’s one of the two sisters brought by Madam You’s stepmother. I spent a whole month with them, so of course I know. They’re really a striking pair. And their name is You.”\n\nXianglian stamped his foot. “This is terrible! It’s quite impossible. The only clean things in your East Mansion are those two stone lions.” At this Baoyu flushed. Xianglian, ashamed of his indiscretion, bowed apologetically. “I deserve to die for saying such a thing.”\n\n\"Nonsense! You must tell me what his character is like.\"\n\n\"If you know so much about him, why ask me? Why, I may not be too pure myself.\"\n\n\"I spoke without thinking,\" said Xianglian apologetically. \"Don't take offence.\"\n\n\"Why bring that up? That sounds as if you meant it.\"\n\nXianglian took his leave then and went off to look for Xue Pan. But reflecting that Xue Pan was ill and too hot-tempered, he decided instead to ask for the return of the betrothal gift. Having made up his mind he went straight to see Jia Lian, who was in his new house. Overjoyed by this visit, Jia Lian hurried out to welcome him and ushered him into the inner room to see his mother-in-law. Xianglian simply bowed to her, addressing her as \"aunt\" and himself as \"your nephew.\" Jia Lian was taken aback.\n\nWhen tea was served, Xianglian said, \"My stay in the capital was so short and hurried, how was I to know that my aunt had arranged a match for me in the fourth month? I've no excuse to offer. It would be wrong to comply with your proposal, brother, and go against my aunt's wishes. If the betrothal gift had been money or silk, I wouldn't dream of asking for it back; but this sword was left me by my grandfather, so I must beg you to return it.\"\n\nThis upset Jia Lian.\n\n\"You're talking nonsense, brother,\" he retorted. \"A betrothal is a betrothal. Who ever heard of people backing out of a marriage? That's absolutely impossible.\"\n\n\"In that case, I'm willing to take the blame and accept any punishment; but I really can't do as you ask.\"\n\nAs Jia Lian was arguing, Xianglian stood up.\n\n\"Please come outside to talk,\" he said. \"This is hardly the place.\"\n\nSanjie in her room had heard every word. She had waited so long for him, and now he had backed out. Obviously in the Jia mansion he had been told that she was a shameless wanton who did not deserve to be his wife. If she let him go now to discuss breaking the engagement with Jia Lian, not only would her brother-in-law be at a loss but she herself would be disgraced if they argued it out. So as soon as Jia Lian went out with their visitor, she swiftly took down the sword. Hiding the sharp blade behind her arm, she hurried out.\n\n\"There's no need to talk outside,\" she cried. \"Here is your betrothal gift back!\" With that she burst into tears and, raising her left hand, offered Xianglian the sword and its sheath; then with her right hand she drew the blade and cut her throat.\n\nAlas!\n\nRed were the shattered petals of fallen peach-blossom,\nGreen the lustrous jade spilled with drops of blood.\n\nBefore the horrified onlookers could come to her rescue, she had fallen. The old lady burst out wailing and cursed Xianglian, while Jia Lian seized him and ordered the servants to tie him up and take him to the court.\n\nErjie stopped crying to plead, \"He didn't force her to do this; she took her own life. What good will it do to take him to court? It will only make a scandal. Better let him go.\"\n\nAt a loss, Jia Lian released Xianglian, who did not leave but stood weeping.\n\n\"I never knew she was such a noble character, so worthy of respect!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm the one who wasn't lucky enough to enjoy such a blessing.\" He gave way to a storm of grief.\n\nAfter the coffin was bought and Sanjie laid in it, he lamented bitterly again before taking his leave.\n\nOnce outside, not knowing where to go in his distraction, he recalled what had just happened.\n\n\"To think that such a beauty was so chaste!\" he mused remorsefully. \"What a pity!\"\n\nHe walked on aimlessly until it seemed to him that he heard a faint tinkling and Sanjie appeared, holding the sword in one hand and in the other a scroll.\n\n\"I waited five years for you, never dreaming you were so heartless,\" she sobbed. \"I have died to prove my love. Now, by the Goddess of Disenchantment's order, I am going to the Illusory Land of the Great Void to register the amorous spirits. This is our last meeting, for we shall not meet again.\" Having said this, she vanished.\n\nXianglian, still loath to let her go....\n\nHe was about to go forward and take her hand to question her, when Third Sister turned from him with a dismissive gesture and was gone. Liu Xianglian gave a great cry. As he wept, he came to himself with the shock and, still sobbing, opened his eyes. It had all been a dream, yet not altogether a dream. He looked around him and found that he was in a dilapidated temple. A lame Taoist was sitting nearby, catching lice. Xianglian rose to his feet, bowed and asked:\n\n“Where is this, holy master? And what is your immortal name?”\n\nThe Taoist smiled.\n\n“How can I tell where we are? Or who I am myself? I am only here to rest awhile.”\n\nXianglian felt a sudden chill pierce him to the marrow. Drawing that sword of masculine strength, he cut off his tousled hair of anguish with a single sweep and followed the lame Taoist, no one knows where.\n\nBut reader, if you wish to know the outcome, read the next chapter."
