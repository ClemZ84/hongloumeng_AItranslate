  "original": "第四回中既将薛家母子在荣府中寄居等事略已表明，此回暂可不写了。如今且说林黛玉自在荣府，一来贾母万般怜爱，寝食起居一如宝玉，把那迎春、探春、惜春三个孙女儿倒且靠后了；就是宝玉黛玉二人的亲密友爱，也较别人不同，日则同行同坐，夜则同止同息，真是言和意顺，似漆如胶。不想如今忽然来了一个薛宝钗，年纪虽大不多，然品格端方，容貌美丽，人人都说黛玉不及。那宝钗却又行为豁达，随分从时，不比黛玉孤高自许，目无下尘，故深得下人之心，就是小丫头们亦多和宝钗亲近。因此黛玉心中便有些不忿，宝钗却是浑然不觉。那宝玉也在孩提之间，况他天性所禀，一片愚拙偏僻，视姊妹兄弟皆如一体，并无亲疏远近之别。如今与黛玉同处贾母房中，故略比别的妹妹熟惯些。既熟惯便更觉亲密，既亲密便不免有些不虞之隙、求全之毁。这日不知为何，二人言语有些不和起来，黛玉又在房中独自垂泪。宝玉也自悔言语冒撞，前去俯就，那黛玉方渐渐的回转过来。\n　　因东边宁府花园内梅花盛开，贾珍之妻尤氏乃治酒具，请贾母、邢夫人、王夫人等赏花，是日先带了贾蓉夫妻二人来面请。贾母等于早饭后过来，就在会芳园游玩，先茶后酒。不过是宁荣二府眷属家宴，并无别样新文趣事可记。\n　　一时宝玉倦怠，欲睡中觉。贾母命人：“好生哄着，歇息一回再来。”贾蓉媳妇秦氏便忙笑道：“我们这里有给宝二叔收拾下的屋子，老祖宗放心，只管交给我就是了。”因向宝玉的奶娘丫鬟等道：“嬷嬷、姐姐们，请宝二叔跟我这里来。”贾母素知秦氏是极妥当的人，因他生得袅娜纤巧，行事又温柔和平，乃重孙媳中第一个得意之人。见他去安置宝玉，自然是放心的了。\n　　当下秦氏引一簇人来至上房内间，宝玉抬头看见是一幅画挂在上面，人物固好，其故事乃是“燃藜图”也，心中便有些不快。又有一副对联，写的是：“世事洞明皆学问，人情练达即文章。”及看了这两句，纵然室宇精美，铺陈华丽，亦断断不肯在这里了，忙说：“快出去，快出去！”秦氏听了笑道：“这里还不好，往那里去呢？要不就往我屋里去罢。”宝玉点头微笑。一个嬷嬷说道：“那里有个叔叔往侄儿媳妇房里睡觉的礼呢？”秦氏笑道：“不怕他恼，他能多大了，就忌讳这些个？上月你没有看见我那个兄弟来了，虽然和宝二叔同年，两个人要站在一处，只怕那一个还高些呢。”宝玉道：“我怎么没有见过他？你带他来我瞧瞧。”众人笑道：“隔着二三十里，那里带去？见的日子有呢。”\n　　说着大家来至秦氏卧房。刚至房中，便有一股细细的甜香。宝玉此时便觉眼饧骨软，连说：“好香！”入房向壁上看时，有唐伯虎画的《海棠春睡图》，两边有宋学士秦太虚写的一副对联云：\n　　　　嫩寒锁梦因春冷，芳气袭人是酒香。\n案上设着武则天当日镜室中设的宝镜，一边摆着赵飞燕立着舞的金盘，盘内盛着安禄山掷过伤了太真乳的木瓜。上面设着寿昌公主于含章殿下卧的宝榻，悬的是同昌公主制的连珠帐。宝玉含笑道：“这里好，这里好！”秦氏笑道：“我这屋子，大约神仙也可以往得了。”说着，亲自展开了西施浣过的纱衾，移了红娘抱过的鸳枕。于是众奶妈伏侍宝玉卧好了，款款散去，只留下袭人、晴雯、麝月、秋纹四个丫鬟为伴。秦氏便叫小丫鬟们好生在檐下看着猫儿打架。\n　　那宝玉才合上眼，便恍恍惚惚的睡去，犹似秦氏在前，悠悠荡荡，跟着秦氏到了一处。但见朱栏玉砌，绿树清溪，真是人迹不逢，飞尘罕到。宝玉在梦中欢喜，想道：“这个地方儿有趣，我若能在这里过一生，强如天天被父母师傅管束呢！”正在胡思乱想，听见山后有人作歌曰：\n　　　　春梦随去散，飞花逐水流。\n　　　　寄言众儿女，何必觅闲愁。\n宝玉听了，是个女孩儿的声气。歌音未息，早见那边走出一个美人来，蹁跹袅娜，与凡人大不相同。有赋为证：\n　　　　方离柳坞，乍出花房。但行处鸟惊庭树，将到时影度回廊。仙袂乍飘兮，闻麝兰之馥郁；荷衣欲动兮，听环佩之铿锵。靥笑春桃兮，云髻堆翠，唇绽樱颗兮，榴齿含香。纤腰之楚楚兮，风回雪舞；耀珠翠之的的兮，鸣绿鹅黄。出没花间兮，宜嗔宜喜；徘徊沧上兮，若飞若扬。娥眉欲颦兮，将言而末语；莲步乍移兮，欲止而仍行。羡美人之良质兮，冰清玉润；慕美人之华服兮，闪烁文章。爱美人之容貌兮，香培玉篆；比美人之态度兮，凤翥龙翔。其素若何，春梅绽雪；其洁若何，秋蕙披霜。其静若何，松生空谷；其艳若何，霞映澄搪。其文若何，龙游曲沼；其神若何，月射寒江。远惭西子，近愧王嫱。生于孰地？降自何方？若非宴罢归来，瑶池不二；定应吹箫引去，紫府无双者也。\n　　宝玉见是一个仙姑，喜的忙来作揖，笑问道：“神仙姐姐，不知从那里来，如今要往那里去？我也不知这里是何处，望乞携带携带。”那仙姑道：“吾居离恨天之上灌愁海之中，乃放春山遣香洞太虚幻境警幻仙姑是也。司人间之宇风情月债，掌尘世之女怨男痴。因近来风流冤孽缠绵于此，是以前来访察机会，布散相思。今日与尔相逢，亦非偶然。此离吾境不远，别无他物，仅有自采仙茗一盏，亲酿美酒几瓮，素练魔舞歌姬数人，新填《红楼梦》仙曲十二支。可试随我一游否？”宝玉听了，喜跃非常，便忘了秦氏在何处了，竟随着这仙姑到了一个所在。忽见前面有一座石碑宇横建，上书“太虚幻境”四大字，两边一副对联，乃是：\n　　　　假作其时真亦假；\n无为有处有还无。\n　　转过牌坊便是一座宫门，上面横书着四个大字，道是“孽海情天”。也有一副对联，大书云：\n　　　　厚地高天，堪叹古今情不尽；\n　　　　痴男怨女，可怜风月债难酬。\n宝玉看了，心下自思道：“原来如此。但不知何为‘古今之情’，又何为‘风月之债’？从今倒要领略领略。”宝玉只顾如此一想，不料早把些邪魔招入膏盲了。当下随了仙姑进入二层门内，只见两边配殿皆有匾额对联，一时看不尽许多，惟见几处写着的是“痴情司”、“结怨司”、“朝啼司”、“暮哭司”、“春感司”、“秋悲司”。看了，因向仙姑道：“敢烦仙姑引我到那各司中游玩游玩，不知可使得么？”仙姑道：“此中各司存的是普天下所有的女子过去未来的簿册，你乃凡眼尘躯，未便先知的。”宝玉听了，那里肯舍，又再四的恳求。那誓幻便说：“也罢，就在此司内略随喜随喜罢。”\n　　宝玉喜不自胜，抬头看这司的匾上，乃是“薄命司”三字，两边写着对联道：\n　　　　春恨秋悲皆自惹；\n花容月貌为谁妍。\n　　宝玉看了，便自感叹。进入门中，只见有十数个大橱，皆用封条封着，看那封条上皆有各省字样。宝玉一心只拣自己家乡的封条看，只见那边橱上封条大书“金陵十二钗正册”，宝玉因问：“何为‘金陵十二钗正册’？”警幻道：“即尔省中十二冠首女子之册，故为正册。”宝玉道：“常听人说金陵极大，怎么只十二个女子？如今单我们家里上上下下就有几百个女孩儿。”警幻微笑道：“一省女子固多，不过择其紧要者录之，两边二橱则又次之。馀者庸常之辈便无册可录了。”宝玉再看下首一橱，上写着“金陵十二钗副册”，又一橱上写着“金陵十二钗又副册”。宝玉便伸手先将“又副册”橱门开了，拿出一本册来。揭开看时，只见这首页上画的既非人物亦非山水，不过是水墨染，满纸乌云浊雾而已。后有几行字迹，写道：\n　　　霁月难逢，彩云易散。心比天高，身为下贱。风流灵巧招人怨。寿夭多因诽谤生，多情公子空牵念。\n　　宝玉看了不甚明白。又见后面画着一簇鲜花，一床破席，也有几句言词写道是：\n　　　　枉自温柔和顺，空云似桂如兰。\n　　　　堪羡优伶有福，谁知公子无缘。\n　　宝玉看了，益发解说不出是何意思。遂将这一本册子搁起来，又去开了“副册”橱门。拿起一本册来打开看时，只见首页也是画，却画着一枝桂花，下面有一方池沼，其中水涸泥干，莲枯藕败。后面书云：\n　　　　根并荷花一茎香，平生遭际实堪伤。\n　　　　自从两地生孤木，致使香魂返故乡。\n　　宝玉看了又不解。又去取那“正册”看时，只见头一页上画着是两株枯木，木上悬着一围玉带；地下又有一堆雪，雪中一股金簪。也有四句诗道\n　　　　可叹停机德，堪怜咏絮才。\n　　　　玉带林中挂，金簪雪里埋。\n　　宝玉看了仍不解，待要问时，知他必不肯泄漏天机，待要丢下又不舍。遂往后看，只见画着一张弓，弓上挂着一个香橼。也有一首歌词云：\n　　　　二十年来辨是非，榴花开处照官闱。\n　　　　三春争及初春景？虎兔相逢大梦归。\n　　后面又画着两个人放风笋，一片大海，一只大船，船中有一女子掩面泣涕之状。画后也有四句写着道：\n　　　　才自清明志自高，生于末世运偏消。\n　　　　清明涕泣江边望，千里东风一梦遥。\n　　后面又画着几缕飞云，一湾逝水。其词曰：\n　　　　富贵又何为？襁褓之间父母违。展眼吊斜辉，湘江水逝楚云飞。\n　　后面又画着一块美玉落在泥污之中。其断语云：\n　　　　欲洁何曾洁？云空未必空。\n　　　　可怜金玉质，终陷淖泥中。\n　　后面忽画一恶狼，追扑一美女，有欲啖之意。其下书云：\n　　　　子系中山狼，得志便猖狂。\n　　　　金闺花柳质，一载赴黄粱。\n　　后面便是一所古庙，里面有一美人，在内看经独坐。其判云：\n　　　　勘破三春景不长，缁衣顿改昔年妆。\n　　　　可怜绣户侯门女，独卧青灯古佛旁。\n　　后面便是一片冰山，上有一只雌凤。其判云：\n　　　　凡鸟偏从末世来，都知爱慕此生才。\n　　　　一从二令三人木，哭向金陵事更哀。\n　　后面又是一座荒村野店，有一美人在那里纺绩。其判曰：\n　　　　势败休云贵，家亡莫论亲。\n　　　　偶因济村妇，巧得逼恩人。\n　　诗后又画一盆茂兰，旁有一位凤冠霞帔的美人。也有判云：\n　　　　桃李春风结子完，到头谁似一盆兰。\n　　　　如冰水好空相妒，枉与他人作笑谈。\n　　诗后又画一座高楼，上有一美人悬梁自尽。其判云：\n　　　　情天情海幻情深，情既相逢必主淫。\n　　　　漫言不肖皆荣出，造衅开瑞实在宁。\n　　宝玉还欲看时，那仙姑知他天分高明、性情颖慧，恐泄漏天机，便掩了卷册，笑向宝玉道：“且随我去游玩奇景，何必在此打这闷葫芦？”\n　　宝玉恍恍惚惚，不觉弃了卷册，又随警幻来至后面。但见画栋雕檐，珠帘绣幕，仙花荡郁，异草芬芳，真好所在也。正是：\n　　　　光摇朱户金铺地，雪照琼窗玉作宫。\n　　又听警幻笑道：“你们快出来迎接贵客。”一言末了，只见房中走出几个仙子来，荷袂骗跹，羽衣飘舞，娇若春花，媚如秋月。见了宝玉，都怨谤警幻道：“我们不知系何贵客，忙的接出来。姐姐曾说今日今时必有绛珠妹子的生魂前来游玩，故我等久待，何故反引这浊物来污染清净女儿之境？”宝玉听如此说，便吓的欲退不能，果觉自形污秽不堪。警幻忙携住宝玉的手向众仙姬笑道：“你等不知原委。今日原欲往荣府去接绛珠，适从宁府经过，偶遇宁荣二公之灵，嘱吾云：‘吾家自国朝定鼎以来，功名契世，富贵流传，已历百年。奈运终数尽不可挽回，我等之子孙虽多竟无可以继业者。惟嫡孙宝玉一人，禀性乖张，用情怪儒，虽聪明灵慧，略可望成，无奈吾家运数合终，恐无人规引入正。幸仙姑偶来，望先以情欲声色等事警其痴顽，或能使他跳出迷人圈子，入于正路，便是吾兄弟之幸了。’如此嘱吾，故发慈心，引彼至此。先以他家上中下三等女子的终身册籍令其熟玩，尚未觉悟；故引了再到此处，遍历那饮馔声色之幻，或冀将来一悟，未可知也。”\n　　说毕，携了宝玉入室。但闻一缕幽香，不知所闻何物。宝玉不禁相问，警幻冷笑道：“此香乃尘世所无，尔如何能知！此系诸名山胜境初生异卉之精，合各种宝林珠树之油所制，名为‘群芳髓’。”宝玉听了，自是羡慕。于是大家入座，小鬟捧上茶来，宝玉觉得香清味美，迎非常品，因又问何名。警幻道：“此茶出在放春山遣香洞，又以仙花灵叶上，所带的宿露烹了，名曰‘千红一窟’。”宝玉听了，点头称赏。因看房内瑶琴、宝鼎、古画、新诗，无所不有，更喜窗下亦有唾绒，奁间时渍粉污。壁上也挂着一副对联，书云：\n　　　　幽微灵秀地；\n无可夺何天。\n　　宝玉看毕，因又请问众仙姑姓名：一名痴梦仙姑，一名钟情大士，一名引愁金女，一名度恨菩提，各各道号不一。少刻，有小鬟来调桌安椅，摆设酒馔。正是：\n　　　　琼桨满泛玻璃盏，玉液浓斟琥珀杯。\n宝玉因此酒香冽异常，又不禁相问。警幻道：“此酒乃以百花之蕤，万木之汁，加以麟髓凤乳酿成，因名为‘万艳同杯’。”宝玉称赏不迭。\n　　饮酒间，又有十二个舞女上来，请问演何调曲。警幻道：“就将新制《红楼梦》十二支演上来。”舞女们答应了，便轻敲檀板，款按银筝，听他歌道是：\n　　开辟鸿蒙，\n方歌了一句，警幻道：“此曲不比尘世中所填传奇之曲，必有生旦净末之则，又有南北九宫之调。此或咏叹一人，或感怀一事，偶成一曲，即可谱入管弦；若非个中人，不知其中之妙。料尔亦未必深明此调，若不先阅其稿，后听其曲，反成嚼蜡矣。”说毕，回头命小鬟取了《红楼梦》原稿来，递与宝玉。宝玉接过来．一面目视其文，耳聆其歌曰：\n　　　　〔红搂梦引子〕开辟鸿蒙，谁为情种？都只为风月情浓。奈何天，伤怀日，寂寥时，试遣愚衷。因此上演出这悲金悼玉的“红楼梦”。\n　　　　〔终身误〕都道是金玉良缘，俺只念木石前盟。空对着山中高士晶莹雪，终不忘世外仙姝寂寞林。叹人间美中不足今方信。纵然是齐眉举案，到底意难平。\n　　　　〔枉凝眉〕一个是阆苑仙葩，一个是美玉无瑕。若说没奇缘，今生偏又遇着他；若说有奇缘，如何心事终虚话？一个枉自嗟呀，一个空劳牵挂。一个是水中月，一个是镜中花。想眼中能有多少泪珠儿，怎禁得秋流到冬，春流到夏！\n　　却说宝玉听了此曲，散漫无稽，未见得好处；但其声韵凄婉，竟能销魂醉魄。因此也不问其原委，也不究其来历，就暂以此释闷而已。因又看下面道：\n　　　　〔恨无常〕喜荣华正好，恨无常又到，眼睁睁把万事全抛，荡悠悠芳魂销耗。望家乡路远山高。故向娘梦里边寻告：儿命己入黄泉，天伦呵，须要退步抽身早！\n　　　　〔分骨肉〕一帆风雨路三千，把骨肉家园，齐来抛闪。恐哭损残年，告爹娘休把儿悬念。自古穷通皆有定，离合岂无缘？从今分两地，各自保平安。奴去也，莫牵连。\n　　　　〔乐中悲〕襁褓中，父母叹双亡。纵居那绮罗丛谁知娇养？幸生来英豪阔大宽宏量，从未将儿女私情，略萦心上。好一似霁月光风耀玉堂。厮配得才貌仙郎，博得个地久天长，准折得幼年时坎坷形状。终久是云散高唐，永涸湘江。这是尘宴中悄长数应当，何必枉悲伤？\n　　　　〔世难容〕气质美如兰，才华馥比仙。天生成孤癖人皆罕。你道是啖肉食腥膻，视绮罗俗厌。却不知好高人愈妒，过洁世同嫌。可叹这青灯古殿人将老，孤负了红粉朱楼春色阑，到头来依旧是风尘肮脏违心愿。分一似无瑕白玉遭泥陷，又何须王孙公子叹无缘？\n　　　　〔喜冤家〕中山狼，无情兽，全不念当日根由。一味的娇奢淫荡贪欢媾。觑者那侯门艳质同蒲柳，作践的公府千金似下流。叹芳魂艳魂，一栽荡悠悠。\n　　　　〔虚花悟〕将那三春勘破，桃红柳绿待如何？把这韶华打灭，觅那清淡天和。说什么天上夭桃盛，云中杏蕊多，到头来谁见把秋捱过？则看那白扬村里人鸣咽，青枫林下鬼吟哦，更兼着连天衰草遮坟墓。这的是昨贫今富人劳碌，春荣秋谢花折磨。似这般生关死动推能躲？闻说道西方宝树唤婆娑，上结着长生果。\n　　　　〔聪明累〕机关算尽大聪明，反算了卿卿性命。生前心己碎，死后性空灵。家富人宁，终有个家亡人散各奔腾。枉费了意悬悬半世心，好一似荡悠悠三更梦。忽喇喇似大厦倾，昏惨惨似灯将尽。呀！一场欢喜忽悲辛，叹人世终难定！\n　　　　（留馀庆〕留馀庆，留馀庆，忽遇恩人；幸娘亲，亲娘亲，积得阴功。劝人生济困扶穷，休似俺那爱银钱忘骨肉的狠舅奸兄。正是乘除加减，上有苍穹。\n　　　　〔晚韶华〕镜里恩情，更那堪梦里功名！那美韶华去之何迅，再休提绣帐鸯衾。只这戴珠冠披凤袄也抵不了无常性命。虽说是人生莫受老来贫，也须要阴骘积儿孙。气昂昂头戴簪缨，光灿灿胸悬金印，威赫赫爵禄高登，昏惨惨黄泉路近！问古来将相可还有？也只是虚名儿后人钦敬。\n　　　　〔好事终〕画梁春尽落香生。擅风情，秉月貌，便是败家的根本。箕裘颓堕皆从敬，家声消亡首罪宁。宿孳总因情！\n　　　　〔飞鸟各投林〕为官的家业雕零，富贵的金银散尽。有恩的死里逃生，无情的分明报应。欠命的命己还，欠泪的泪已尽：冤冤相报自非轻，分离聚合皆前定。欲知命短问前生，老来富贵也真侥幸。看破的循入空门，痴迷的枉送了性命。好一似食尽鸟投林，落了片白茫茫大地真干净！\n　　歌毕，还又歌副歌。誓幻见宝玉甚无趣味，因叹：“痴儿竟尚未悟！”那宝玉忙止歌姬不必再唱，自觉朦胧恍惚，告醉求卧。\n警幻便命撤去残席，送宝玉至一香闺绣阁中。其间铺陈之盛，乃素所未见之物。更可骇者，早有一位仙姬在内，其鲜艳妩媚大似宝钗，袅娜风流又如黛玉。正不知是何意，忽见警幻说道：“尘世中多少富贵之家，那些绿窗风月，绣阁烟霞，皆被那些淫污纨裤与流荡女子玷辱了。更可恨者，自古来多少轻薄浪子，皆以‘好色不淫’为解，又以‘情而不淫’作案，此皆饰非掩丑之语耳。好色即淫，知情更淫。是以巫山之会，云雨之欢，皆由既悦其色，复恋其情所致。吾所爱汝者，乃天下古今第一淫人也！”宝玉听了，唬的慌忙答道：“仙姑差了！我因懒于读书，家父母尚每垂训饬，岂敢再冒‘淫’字？况且年纪尚幼，不知‘淫’何事。”警幻道：“非也。淫虽一理，意则有别。如世之好淫者，不过悦容貌，喜歌舞，调笑无厌，云雨无时，恨不能天下之美女供我片时之趣兴。此皆皮肤游淫之敦物耳。如尔则天分中生成一段痴情，吾辈推之为‘意淫’。惟‘意淫‘二字，可心会而不可口传，可神通而不能语达。汝今独得此二字，在闺阁中虽可为良友，却于世道中未免迂阔怪诡，百一嘲谤，万目睚眦。今既遇尔祖宁荣二公剖腹深嘱，吾不忍子独为我闺阁增光而见弃于世道。故引子前来，醉以美酒，沁以仙茗，警以妙曲。再将吾妹一人，乳名兼美表字可卿者许配与汝，今夕良时即可成姻。不过令汝领略此仙闺幻境之风光尚然如此，何况尘世之情景呢。从今后万万解释，改悟前情，留意于孔孟之间，委身于经济之道。”说毕，便秘授以云雨之事，推宝玉入房中，将门掩上自去。那宝玉恍恍惚惚，依着警幻所嘱，未免作起儿女的事来，也难以尽述。至次日，便柔情缱绻，软语温存，与可卿难解难分。因二人携手出去游玩之时，忽然至一个所在，但见荆榛遍地，狼虎同行，迎面一道黑溪阻路，并无桥梁可通。正在犹豫之间，忽见警幻从后追来，说道：“快休前进，作速回头要紧！”宝玉忙止步问道：“此系何处？”警幻道：“此乃迷津，深有万丈，遥亘千里。中无舟揖可通，只有一个木筏，乃木居士掌柁，灰侍者撑篙，不受金银之谢，但遇有缘者渡之。尔今偶游至此，设如坠落其中，便深负我从前谆谆警戒之语了。”话犹末了，只听迷津内响如雷声，有许多夜叉海鬼将宝玉拖将下去。吓得宝玉汗下如雨，一面失声喊叫：“可卿救我！”吓得袭人辈众丫鬟忙上来搂住，叫：“宝玉不怕，我们在这里呢！”\n    却说秦氏正在房外嘱咐小丫头们好生看着猫儿狗儿打架，忽闻宝玉在梦中唤他的小名儿，因纳闷道：“我的小名儿这里从无人知道，他如何得知，在梦中叫出来？”\n    未知何因，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Now that Chapter IV has given a brief account of the Xue family’s stay in the Rong Mansion, we can return to Daiyu, who as the object of the Lady Dowager’s affection shared all Baoyu’s meals and amusements. The three granddaughters Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun were treated as poor relations by comparison; and the love between Baoyu and Daiyu was unlike that of other children. They were inseparable. Where one went, the other would follow. And so close was their understanding that they were constantly falling out and making it up again.\n\nThen suddenly along came Xue Baochai, who though not much older was so well-formed and so dignified, so charming and so accomplished, that most people considered Daiyu her inferior. Moreover, in contrast to Daiyu’s standoffish pride, Baochai had a generous, accommodating nature which made her very popular. In this way she unwittingly incurred Daiyu’s resentment.\n\nBaoyu, for his part, was still only a child. So childish, in fact, that he made no distinction between the girls in the degree of his affection. Being with Daiyu all day in his grandmother’s rooms, he was naturally more intimate with her than with the rest; and greater intimacy led to occasional tiffs.\n\nOne day for no known reason they had one of these quarrels and Daiyu was crying again alone in her room. Baoyu too was sorry and went to apologize, until she was mollified.\n\nIn the east courtyard of the Ning Mansion the plum-trees in the garden were in full bloom. Jia Zhen’s wife, Madam You, had some wine prepared and invited the Lady Dowager, Lady Xing and Lady Wang to a flower-viewing party. She brought Jia Rong and his wife along to extend the invitation in person. The Lady Dowager and the others went over after breakfast and were entertained in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, first with tea and then with wine. But as this was simply a family party with no special features worth recording, we need say no more about it.\n\nPresently Baoyu felt tired and wanted to take a nap. The Lady Dowager ordered some of the servants to see him safely to his room to rest. Qin Keqing, Jia Rong’s wife, smiled and said:\n\n“We have a room ready here for Uncle Bao. Leave it to me, Old Ancestress, I’ll see that he’s all right.”\n\nShe turned to his nurses and maids and added, “Come, aunties and sisters, Uncle Bao is going to have a nap.”\n\nKnowing Keqing to be a reliable young woman, and the favourite among her great-granddaughters-in-law for her grace and gentle ways, the Lady Dowager felt no misgivings and let her take him away.\n\nQin Keqing led the party to an inner room, where Baoyu saw a painting by an old master hanging on the wall. The figures in it fascinated him. They were scholars. The painting was The School Upheld and the inscription read:\n\nA grasp of mundane affairs is genuine knowledge,\nUnderstanding of worldly wisdom is true learning.\n\nBut although the room was beautifully furnished, Baoyu wanted to get away at once.\n\n“I won’t stay here,” he cried. “I won’t stay here.”\n\n“If this is no good, where will you go?” asked Keqing with a smile. “Well, come to my room.”\n\nBaoyu nodded and smiled.\n\nOne of the nurses demurred, “How can an uncle sleep in his nephew’s wife room?”\n\nKeqing laughed.\n\n“He won’t mind. Why should you? He’s only a child. Didn’t you see my brother here the other day? Although he’s the same age as Uncle Bao, if they stood side by side I’m sure he’d be the taller.”\n\n“Why haven’t I met him?” asked Baoyu. “Do bring him here to see me.”\n\n“He lives twenty or thirty li away,” chuckled the others. “You’ll have to wait for another chance.”\n\nAs they talked they reached Keqing’s room. Just inside the door a very subtle\n\nA sweet perfume assailed his nostrils. He felt a thrill run through his limbs and could not refrain from exclaiming, “What a lovely scent!” As he entered the room, he saw on the wall a painting by Tang Yin entitled “Spring Slumber” depicting a beautiful woman asleep under a crab-apple tree, whose buds had not yet opened. On the two scrolls flanking it were two lines of verse written by Qin Guan in his delicate running hand:\n\nOn the coolness of spring the gentle dream reposes,\nA fragrant breath the maiden’s robe discloses.\n\nOn the dressing-table was a rare mirror from Wu Zetian’s “Hall of Mirrors.” In the gold tray by it, on which Zhao Feiyan once danced, was the quince thrown by An Lushan at Lady Yang which had wounded her breast. At one end of the room stood the couch on which Princess Shouyang had slept in the Hanzhang Palace, and over it hung the curtains strung with pearls by Princess Tongchang. Baoyu was delighted.\n\n“This is the place for me,” he cried.\n\n“I fancy this room of mine is fit for an immortal,” said Keqing smiling.\n\nShe unfolded the quilt that had been aired by Xishi and arranged the bridal pillow Hongniang had offered for Yingying. Then the nurses and maids helped Baoyu to bed and quietly withdrew, leaving only Xiren, Qingwen, Sheyue and Qiuwen to wait on him. Keqing told the younger maids to keep an eye on the cats and dogs fighting in the corridor.\n\nAs soon as Baoyu closed his eyes he fell fast asleep and dreamed that Keqing was before him. In a daze he followed her a long way to some crimson balustrades and white marble steps among green trees and clear streams, in a place seldom trodden by foot of man and undefiled by dust. He was thinking how pleasant it was there when he heard someone calling. A girl was singing:\n\n“Spring’s dream will scatter like a cloud,\nSpring’s flowers are washed away by streams.\nBeware, all mortal maidens fair,\nFor him who loves to dally there!”\n\nIt was a girl’s voice. Before the sound had died away a beautiful woman appeared before him, as graceful as a willow-shoot and as radiant as an autumn moon. One could see at a glance that she was no ordinary mortal. For she was like:\n\nA fresh-blown flower in the snow,\nOr a graceful willow reflected on ice.\nHer heart was finer than the lotus seed,\nHer purity deeper than the plum’s pale blossom.\nShe might have been feasted in a fairy hall\nOr come from the moon, that goddess cold.\nHow charmingly she smiled, with dimpled cheeks;\nHow light her step, as on the wind she sailed.\nHer brows were knit yet not in anger,\nLike summer lotus buds her lips were red.\nHer waist was so slender that one hand could span it,\nHer glossy hair looked as if lightly powdered.\nHer elegance was that of a pampered favourite at court,\nHer splendour that of the peacock princess in flight.\nHer purity can be compared only to the pear blossom in snow,\nHer chastity to the autumn chrysanthemum coated with frost.\nShe should have lived in the Palace of Immortals,\nBe it not that she had come to the earth divine.\nShe changed and grew, now advancing, now retreating,\nAbout to speak, yet hesitating to begin.\nHer fairy petals, not fully open, were half-revealed;\nHer fragrant heart, still hidden, was not yet disclosed.\nHer lovely shadow flitted by the wind-swept snow,\nHer pearl and emerald ornaments tinkled like bells.\nHalf of her dimpled cheeks was visible,\nHer lotus feet moved with a fairy’s tread.\nShe had no mortal peer,\nNo equal in the world.\nHer face was that of an angel from the moon,\nHer form that of a goddess from a fairy isle.\n\nBaoyu knew that she must be a goddess and, stepping forward with a bow, asked with a smile:\n“May I know, fairy goddess, where you have come from and whither you are going? I do not know this place. May I beg you to be my guide?”\n\n“I am the Goddess of Disenchantment from the Grotto of Emanated Fragrance on the Mountain of Expanding Spring in the Sea of Sadness,” she told him. “I preside over the romances and unrequited loves of all mortals, and the grief and longing of women in the mundane world. I have come here today because I have some karma to discharge. I met you now by chance, and this is no coincidence either. This place is not far from my abode. I have nothing much to offer you, but I can give you a cup of fairy tea if you will come with me, and some rare wine and fairy songs. I have also some fairy maidens who are good dancers. Would you care to come?”\n\nthe twelve fairy songs of the Red Chamber. Will you come with me and see them?”\n\nBaoyu was too delighted to think of Qin Shi and followed the fairy.\n\nSuddenly they came to a stone archway with the inscription in large characters: Illusory Land of Great Void. A couplet on the two columns read:\n\nWhen false is taken for true, true becomes false;\nIf non-being turns into being, being becomes non-being.\n\nBeyond this archway was a palace gate with the horizontal inscription: Sea of Grief and Heaven of Love. The couplet on the two columns here was:\n\nFirm as earth and lofty as heaven, passion from time immemorial knows no end;\nPity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to it to require debts of breeze and moonlight.\n\n“So that’s it,” thought Baoyu. “I wonder what is meant by ‘passion from time immemorial’ and ‘debts of breeze and moonlight.’ From now on I must find out.”\n\nHis mind was running on this when unawares he infatuated himself. He followed the fairy through the second gate and saw halls on both sides with tablets above them and couplets on the two sides. He could not read all of them but noticed one tablet which read: Board of Infatuated Love. Others were: Board of Jealousy, Board of Morning Tears, Board of Night Grief, Board of Spring Longing and Board of Autumn Sorrow.\n\n“May I trouble you, fairy, to take me inside to have a look?” he asked.\n\n“In these boards are kept the records of the past and future of all women in the world,” she told him. “With your mortal eyes and carnal body you are not permitted to know any-thing in advance.”\n\nBut Baoyu pleaded so hard that she said, “Very well, you may have a quick look in this board.”\n\nOverjoyed, he raised his head and saw the tablet: Board of the Ill-Fated. The couplet on the two columns was:\n\nSorrow and grief were of their own seeking;\nFair looks and fame for whom did they avail?\n\nHe sighed as he read this and went in. The board contained a dozen or more large cabinets classified by provinces. He was not interested in the others but wanted to look up the records for his own province. So he searched until he found the cabinet marked Jinling and in it “The Twelve Beauties of Jinling in Main Register.”\n\n“Why are there only twelve girls in this register for such a big place as Jinling?” he asked. “Why, in my own household there are several hundred girls, to say nothing of other families.”\n\n“The chief register for each province contains the names of the most important girls,” the fairy told him with a smile. “The secondary and tertiary registers are for the others. As for the common run, we don’t keep any records of them.”\n\nBaoyu looked then and saw two more cabinets marked “Supplementary Register for the Twelve Beauties of Jinling” and “Secondary Supplementary Register for the Twelve Beauties of Jinling.” He opened the door of the second supplementary register and took out a book. On opening it he saw a painting, not of a landscape or figure but of an inky cloud. He could make nothing of this. Then he saw some verses:\n\nSeldom the moon shines in a cloudless sky,\nAnd days of brightness all too soon pass by.\nA noble and aspiring mind\nIn a base born body confined,\nYour charm and wit did only hatred gain,\nAnd in the end you were by slanders slain,\nYour lord’s tender thought for you were all in vain.\n\nHe did not understand this either. Next he saw a painting of a bouquet of fresh flowers and a torn mat, with the verses:\n\nGentle you were and kind,\nTo bring good luck to all you had the will;\nBut an actor was your lot, your lord was cold,\nAnd all your warm devotion was for naught.\n\nThis was still more obscure to Baoyu. He put this register away and opened the\n\nHe opened the door of the “Supplementary Register” and took out an album. On the first page was a painting of a spray of osmanthus above a dry pool with withered lotus roots and leaves. Beside this was the verse:\n\nSweet is she as the lotus in flower,\n\nYet none so sorely oppressed;\n\nAfter the growth of a lonely tree in two soils\n\nHer sweet soul will be dispatched to its final rest.\n\nThis was no clearer to him than the first. He put this album back and took out the main one again. On the first page were two枯 trees with a jade belt hanging in their foliage, and a pile of snow at the foot of one tree from which emerged a gold hairpin. There were four lines of verse:\n\nAlas for her wifely virtue,\n\nHer wit to sing of willow-down, poor maid!\n\nBuried in snow the broken golden hairpin,\n\nAnd hanging in the wood the belt of jade.\n\nBaoyu could make nothing of this either. He wanted to ask the goddess, but decided that she would not betray the secrets of fate and he would just have to bear the suspense. So he read on. The next picture showed a bow with a citron hanging from it. And the verse was:\n\nWhen twenty years her life of “shoulds” and “oughts”\n\nThe pomegranate will open against the blue;\n\nThough three springs never equal the first spring flash,\n\nWhen hare and tiger meet, from the great dream she’ll rush.\n\nAfter this came a picture of two people flying a kite, a great sea, and a large boat in which sat a girl crying as if her heart would break. There were four lines of verse:\n\nBlessed with a shrewd mind and noble ambitions,\n\nBorn in a decadent age and an ill-fated hour;\n\nHer tears in spring by the riverside congealed,\n\nRiding the wind one day a thousand miles would speed.\n\nNext came a few wisps of cloud and a stretch of running water, with the verse:\n\nWhat price your rank and wealth?\n\nIt is too soon your parents’ hearts to break!\n\nGazing at the setting sun in the river,\n\nThe Xiang flows and the Chu clouds sail away for ever.\n\nAfter this was painted a piece of beautiful jade lying in the mud, with the comment:\n\nPure she would be, but never pure she was;\n\nAloof she would be, but never could prevail.\n\nPity this jade so fine, so fair —\n\nTo end up mired in the mire.\n\nThen a savage wolf was shown chasing a beautiful girl and about to devour her. Under this was written:\n\nFor husband, heartless as a savage wolf;\n\nHis object gained, he ruthlessly berates her;\n\nFair bloom, sweet willow in a golden bower,\n\nToo soon a rude awakening awaits her.\n\nThis was followed by the picture of an ancient temple with a beautiful woman sitting inside reading a sutra alone. The comment was:\n\nShe sees through the transience of spring,\n\nDark Buddhist robes replace her garments fine;\n\nPity this child of a wealthy noble house\n\nWho now sleeps alone by the dimly lit old shrine.\n\nNext came a picture of a glacier on which a female phoenix was perched. The verdict was:\n\nThis bird appears when evil omens rife;\n\nAll praise her talents and her high descent;\n\nBut from one “ping” she must take “ling” then “tsao,”\n\nAnd mourn her fate by Chinling far away.\n\nAfter this was painted a tumble-down hut in a poor village with a beautiful girl spinning inside. The verdict was:\n\nWhen fortune frowns, nobility means nothing;\n\nWhen a house is ruined, kinsmen turn unkind.\n\nBecause of a trifling, kind act to a village dame\n\nA surprising reward she in time will find.\n\nAfter the verse came a painting of a fine orchid in a pot beside a beautiful girl in a phoenix head-dress and red cape. The verdict was:\n\nPeach and plum in spring winds finish their course,\n\nBut who can bloom like the orchid at last?\n\nPure as ice and water she arouses envy,\n\nVain the groundless gossip against her cast.\n\nThen came a high building on which a beautiful girl was hanging herself, with this comment:\n\nLove boundless as sea and sky is but illusion;\n\nWhen lovers meet, lust must be king.\n\nSay not that all that is amiss comes from the Rong Mansion;\n\nTruly, disaster originates from the Ning.\n\nBaoyu wanted to go on looking, but the fairy, knowing how intelligent and quick-witted he was, was afraid the secrets of heaven might be泄露 and so closed the book.\n\n“Come with me and see the sights,” she said with a smile. “Why puzzle over these silly riddles?”\n\nBaoyu, still in a daze, put the albums down and followed the goddess.\n\nHe saw a building with carved beams and painted pillars, pearl blinds embroidered curtains, fresh flowers and rare plants. It was indeed a splendid place. To be precise:\n\nGold paved the ground where brilliant red doors shook,\n\nSnow-white light streaming in through windows of jade.\n\nJust then Disenchantment laughed and said, “Come out quickly and welcome our honoured guest.”\n\nAs the words were uttered several fairy maidens came out. Their full sleeves fluttered in the wind and their gorgeous dresses swayed, lovely as spring blossom and entrancing as the autumn moon. At sight of Pao-yu they complained to Disenchantment, “So this is your honoured guest! Why did you have to bring this filthy creature into our pure maiden’s realm? We didn’t know who it was and rushed out to meet him. You told us today would be the day for the living soul of our Crimson Pearl to come on a visit. That’s why we’ve been waiting so long. Instead, you’ve brought this disgusting creature to defile us.”\n\nPao-yu was so overwhelmed with shame he wished he could withdraw, but he could not tear himself away. Indeed, he felt how unworthy he was.\n\nDisenchantment took him by the hand and said to the maidens with a smile, “You don’t understand. I meant to go to the Jung Mansion to fetch the Crimson Pearl, but on the way I happened to pass the Ning Mansion and met the spirits of the Duke of Ningkuo and the Duke of Jungkuo. They said to me, ‘Since our dynasty was founded, our family has enjoyed wealth and rank for a hundred years; but now our luck has run out and there is no way to revive it. We have many descendants, but not one can continue our line. The only one of any promise is our great-grandson Pao-yu; but his character is so perverse that no one can reason with him. Although he is intelligent and quick-witted, we fear that the good fortune of our house may be exhausted so that no one can guide him to the right way. Fortunately you are passing by, goddess. We beg you to take him in hand. Use love and desire, sounds and sights to warn him against his folly. Perhaps he will emerge from this maze and take the right path. Then our two houses will be most grateful.’ So I have brought him here. First I made him study the registers of the girls in his own household, high and low alike; but he failed to grasp the message. That is why I have brought him to this place for an experience of fairy wine, fairy music and fairy songs in the hope that he may yet come to his senses.”\n\nSo saying she led him inside. A subtle perfume assailed him, he knew not from what source. Pao-yu could not resist asking what it was.\n\n“You wouldn’t know,” Disenchantment told him with a smile. “This scent is not to be found in the world of mortals. It is made from the essence of rare herbs which grow on famous mountains of immortality and from the aromatic oils distilled from precious plants growing in magic grottoes. It is called ‘Marrow of Many Fragrances.’”\n\nPao-yu expressed his admiration. They seated themselves then and a young maid served tea, which seemed to Pao-yu clear and fragrant beyond compare. He asked its name.\n\n“This tea grows in the Grotto of Emanating Fragrance on the Mountain of Expanding Spring,” Disenchantment told him. “It is brewed overnight with the dew collected from fairy flowers and spiritual leaves, and is called ‘Thousand Red Flowers in One Cavern.’”\n\nPao-yu nodded in praise. Looking around, he saw jade lutes inlaid with pearls, bronze tripods painted with gold, paintings by old masters and new poems. There were rouge-stains too under the window and powder-marks on the dressing-table. But what pleased him most was the pair of scrolls on the wall:\n\nEarth’s essence, quintessence,\n\nHard to find in the world;\n\nHeaven’s mystery, wonder,\n\nOnly seen in this place.\n\nHe asked the names of the fairy maidens. One was Dream of Many Years, one was Great Mistress of Love, one had been named Bringer of Sorrow, and another Messenger of Grief — their appellations were all different.\n\nSoon a young maid came in to set the table and chairs for a feast.\n\n“We have nothing to offer you,” said Disenchantment, “but we would like to share with you a cup of our weak wine. I hope you won’t refuse.”\n\nAs she spoke, maids came in to lay the table with all sorts of rare delicacies. The jade cups were filled with aromatic wine.\n\n“This wine is brewed from the petals of a hundred flowers and the sap of ten thousand trees, blended with the marrow of unicorns and fermented with phoenix milk,” Disenchantment told him. “Hence its name ‘Ten Thousand Beauties in One Cup.’”\n\nPao-yu could not find words to praise it enough.\n\nDuring the feast twelve dancing-girls came in to ask what songs they should perform.\n\n“The twelve new songs of the Dream of Red Mansions,” Disenchantment told them.\n\nThe girls assented and to the accompaniment of sandalwood clappers and silver lyres they started to sing:\n\nWhen the world was first made,\n\n“Stop!” cried Disenchantment. “These new songs are not like the old operas with their plots taken from history. They tell about the loves and hates in the Great Illusory Realm of the Red Dust, and each song is a moving lament. You wouldn’t understand them without the libretto. Wait till you’ve read that.”\n\nShe ordered the libretto to be brought and handed it to Pao-yu, who took it. He found it hard to understand the meaning, but the haunting music and the melancholy charm of the words made an impression on him. Without trying to grasp the meaning, therefore, he simply read it through.\n\nThe melodies are set to the nine northern and southern modes. They may eulogize a person or describe some incident; and once a song is composed it can be tuned for wind and string instruments. Unless you are an initiate you can’t appreciate the charm of these songs. I don’t suppose you’ll understand them either. So unless you read the libretto first and then listen, it will be like chewing wax.” With that she turned and told a maid to fetch the libretto of A Dream of Red Mansions and hand it to Baoyu.\n\nHe took it and read as he listened:\n\nPrologue to A Dream of Red Mansions\n\nSince first the world was made,\n\nWho has been love’s protagonist?\n\nAll feelings are ordained,\n\nFate has a hand in all that doth exist.\n\nSo on a drear, dark day\n\nIn melancholy mood\n\nI sought to disengage\n\nMy foolish heart from care;\n\nHence this “Dream of Red Mansions” tale\n\nLamenting gold and jade.\n\nLife’s Folly\n\nAll men spiritual life know to be good,\n\nBut fame to disregard they never could;\n\nWhere e’er they go their former acts still haunt them,\n\nAnd with their old desires they’re still besotted.\n\nAfter long strife in confusion they’re lost:\n\nFor while they dread the ending of their span,\n\nThey have not learned to profit while they can.\n\nAlas, nothing can their infatuation cure,\n\nAnd their time is wasted evermore.\n\nWasted Love\n\nWhat is the loveliest thing on earth?\n\nOne: a useless, fine, rare bird in a cage;\n\nTwo: a jade token among the ashes;\n\nThree: a white, bald bough in snow.\n\nThen the moon is full which soon must wane;\n\nThe water is clear but has no fish;\n\nFutility of ambition, of affection,\n\nOf literary eminence and of economy!\n\nBefore it is too late happiness should be enjoyed,\n\nFor life is short and death ends all.\n\nAll are predestined, do not complain,\n\nOld age and youth will each have their turn.\n\nSeparation of Lovers\n\nHard it is for lovers to meet,\n\nHarder still to part.\n\nThe east wind is too weak to blow away our sorrow:\n\nSpring silkworms weave until they die,\n\nEach night the candle sheds its tears till dry.\n\nMorning mirror only makes us pine,\n\nWhile evening rain enhances our despair.\n\nIf you should come some day to Penglai’s fairy isle,\n\nPlease tell the faithful maid that I am well.\n\nOh, it is difficult for us to meet\n\nAnd hard to part;\n\nThe flowers fade and fall, but who has pity?\n\nThe silkworm’s silk is all spun ere it dies,\n\nThe candle’s tears are dried when it burns out.\n\nI dread to look in my glass at morning,\n\nGrieved to find my cloudlike hair turned hoary.\n\nI hum a poem by the light of the moon,\n\nBut there is no one to appreciate it.\n\nThe brocade quilt is cold, who will share it?\n\nImmortal as I am, I long to mount to heaven.\n\nHow can I bear to lock the sweet flowers in the inner courtyard,\n\nLeaving the cloud on the hill and the moon in the sky?\n\nBut I advise the flowers not to pine,\n\nFor when I am gone there will be someone to care for you.\n\nYou will be petted and loved,\n\nBut don’t forget the one who is far away.\n\nI have a verse to offer you:\n\nDon’t think that I am fickle and untrue,\n\nI have no choice but to go away.\n\nThough I am gone, my heart will stay with you,\n\nAnd we shall meet again some day.\n\nFarewell, my dear, I must be gone,\n\nBut don’t be sad, for we shall meet again.\n\nFarewell, my dear, I must be gone,\n\nBut don’t be sad, for we shall meet again.\n\nBaoyu found this song diffuse and rambling, without much merit; but its melancholy cadence touched his heart. However, not troubling to find out whence it came or what it meant, he simply listened to while away the time. Then he read on:\n\nAll Good Things Must End\n\nIn full bloom the flowers must die,\n\nAll must be scattered, whirled away.\n\nThe soul of the fair, lonely maid\n\nHas vanished in the dark, leaving no trace.\n\nFarewell, homeland, so far away!\n\nWhat use to warn my parents in a dream?\n\nMy life has slipped away,\n\nMy family should withdraw before it is too late.\n\nParting from One’s Family\n\nThree thousand li I sailed with the wind,\n\nLeaving my home and kinsfolk far behind.\n\nI feared that my parents in their grief would age,\n\nAnd begged them to take comfort for my sake.\n\nSince poverty and wealth are ordained by fate,\n\nPartings and reunions are decreed by Heaven.\n\nNow though we dwell in different lands,\n\nLet each but live in peace — that is my one desire.\n\nDear brother and sister, mother dear,\n\nI can no longer stay!\n\nParting from Home\n\nThe young lady left her home in a distant land,\n\nBidding farewell to her parents and going far away.\n\nShe told them on the journey not to worry,\n\nFor marriage is decreed by fate.\n\nWho knows whether she would find a good husband?\n\nHe might be a spendthrift, a wastrel, a profligate,\n\nAnd then she would be stranded far from home,\n\nWith no one to turn to, no one to care for her.\n\nBut she was lucky, she found a good man,\n\nA handsome, talented, kind husband.\n\nHe loved her and she loved him,\n\nThey were happy together, and she had a son.\n\nBut good fortune never lasts,\n\nHer husband died, and she was left alone.\n\nNow she must rely on her son,\n\nAnd hope that he would do well in life.\n\nShe brought him up with care,\n\nAnd he studied hard and passed the examinations.\n\nHe became an official and brought glory to the family,\n\nAnd she was honoured as a lady.\n\nBut she never forgot her humble origins,\n\nAnd she was always kind to the poor and needy.\n\nShe lived to a ripe old age,\n\nAnd died respected by all.\n\nThis is the story of a good woman,\n\nWho overcame adversity and found happiness.\n\nThe Song of the Hair\n\nMy black hair, once so thick and long,\n\nNow is thin and streaked with grey.\n\nI remember how I used to comb it,\n\nAnd how it shone in the sun.\n\nBut now it is dull and lifeless,\n\nAnd I am old and faded.\n\nI look in the mirror and sigh,\n\nFor youth has gone, never to return.\n\nBut I have no regrets,\n\nFor I have lived a full life.\n\nI have known love and joy,\n\nAnd I have borne children.\n\nNow I am content to grow old gracefully,\n\nAnd to let my hair turn white.\n\nFor white hair is a sign of wisdom,\n\nAnd of a life well lived.\n\nSo I shall not dye my hair,\n\nBut let it be as it is.\n\nAnd when I die, I shall be buried with my white hair,\n\nAs a symbol of my long and happy life.\n\nThe Song of the Fan\n\nI am a fan, round and white,\n\nI was made in the palace of the Han.\n\nI was carried by a beautiful lady,\n\nWho used me to hide her face when she smiled.\n\nBut now I am old and torn,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am thrown aside and forgotten,\n\nAnd I lie in the dust.\n\nBut I remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the lady cherished me.\n\nShe would not let me out of her sight,\n\nAnd she would often stroke me with her delicate hand.\n\nBut now she is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I lie here in the dust,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a kind person will find me,\n\nAnd take me home and mend me.\n\nThen I shall be useful again,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Lute\n\nI am a lute, made of paulownia wood,\n\nMy strings are of silk, my bridge of jade.\n\nI was played by a famous musician,\n\nWho could make me weep or laugh.\n\nBut now I am old and out of tune,\n\nAnd no one plays me any more.\n\nI am left in a corner, covered with dust,\n\nAnd I am lonely and sad.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the musician loved me.\n\nHe would play me for hours on end,\n\nAnd the music would fill the room.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am silent,\n\nAnd I have no one to play me.\n\nSo I sit here in the corner,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a musician will come,\n\nAnd tune my strings and play me again.\n\nThen I shall make beautiful music once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Sword\n\nI am a sword, made of fine steel,\n\nMy blade is sharp, my hilt of gold.\n\nI was carried by a brave warrior,\n\nWho used me to defend his country.\n\nBut now I am old and rusty,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am hung on the wall, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am dull and lifeless.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the warrior cherished me.\n\nHe would polish me every day,\n\nAnd he would never let me out of his sight.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I hang here on the wall,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a warrior will come,\n\nAnd take me down and polish me.\n\nThen I shall be sharp and bright again,\n\nAnd I shall be ready for battle.\n\nThe Song of the Horse\n\nI am a horse, strong and swift,\n\nI was ridden by a great general.\n\nI carried him into battle,\n\nAnd I helped him to win victories.\n\nBut now I am old and lame,\n\nAnd no one rides me any more.\n\nI am left in the stable, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am thin and weak.\n\nI remember the days when I was young,\n\nAnd how the general loved me.\n\nHe would groom me every day,\n\nAnd he would feed me the best fodder.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I stand here in the stable,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a general will come,\n\nAnd take me out and ride me again.\n\nThen I shall be strong and swift once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Boat\n\nI am a boat, made of fine wood,\n\nI was sailed by a skilled sailor.\n\nI carried him across the seas,\n\nAnd I helped him to discover new lands.\n\nBut now I am old and leaky,\n\nAnd no one sails me any more.\n\nI am left on the shore, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am rotting away.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the sailor cherished me.\n\nHe would caulk my seams every day,\n\nAnd he would paint me every year.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I lie here on the shore,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a sailor will come,\n\nAnd repair me and sail me again.\n\nThen I shall be seaworthy once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Book\n\nI am a book, full of wisdom,\n\nI was read by a learned scholar.\n\nHe studied me day and night,\n\nAnd he gained knowledge from me.\n\nBut now I am old and tattered,\n\nAnd no one reads me any more.\n\nI am left on the shelf, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am covered with dust.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the scholar cherished me.\n\nHe would handle me with care,\n\nAnd he would never dog-ear my pages.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I sit here on the shelf,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a scholar will come,\n\nAnd take me down and read me again.\n\nThen I shall be useful once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Painting\n\nI am a painting, full of beauty,\n\nI was admired by a connoisseur.\n\nHe would gaze at me for hours,\n\nAnd he would praise my colours and composition.\n\nBut now I am old and faded,\n\nAnd no one admires me any more.\n\nI am hung on the wall, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am dark and dim.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the connoisseur cherished me.\n\nHe would dust me every day,\n\nAnd he would protect me from the sun.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I hang here on the wall,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a connoisseur will come,\n\nAnd take me down and admire me again.\n\nThen I shall be beautiful once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Flower\n\nI am a flower, full of fragrance,\n\nI was picked by a beautiful maiden.\n\nShe wore me in her hair,\n\nAnd I made her more beautiful.\n\nBut now I am withered and dead,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am thrown on the ground, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am trampled underfoot.\n\nI remember the days when I was fresh,\n\nAnd how the maiden cherished me.\n\nShe would water me every day,\n\nAnd she would protect me from the wind.\n\nBut now she is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I lie here on the ground,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a maiden will come,\n\nAnd pick me and wear me in her hair again.\n\nThen I shall be fragrant once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Bird\n\nI am a bird, full of song,\n\nI was kept by a kind master.\n\nHe would feed me every day,\n\nAnd he would listen to my singing.\n\nBut now I am old and silent,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am left in the cage, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am sad and lonely.\n\nI remember the days when I was young,\n\nAnd how the master cherished me.\n\nHe would clean my cage every day,\n\nAnd he would give me fresh water.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I sit here in the cage,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a master will come,\n\nAnd take me out and listen to my singing again.\n\nThen I shall sing joyfully once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Fish\n\nI am a fish, full of life,\n\nI was kept in a clear pond.\n\nI would swim happily all day,\n\nAnd I would leap out of the water.\n\nBut now I am old and sluggish,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am left in the pond, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am listless and sad.\n\nI remember the days when I was young,\n\nAnd how the pond was clean and clear.\n\nBut now the pond is dirty and stagnant,\n\nAnd I can hardly breathe.\n\nSo I swim here in the pond,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day the pond will be cleaned,\n\nAnd I shall be happy again.\n\nThe Song of the Tree\n\nI am a tree, tall and strong,\n\nI was planted by a wise man.\n\nI provided shade in summer,\n\nAnd shelter in winter.\n\nBut now I am old and hollow,\n\nAnd no one wants me any more.\n\nI am left in the forest, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am decaying away.\n\nI remember the days when I was young,\n\nAnd how the wise man cherished me.\n\nHe would water me every day,\n\nAnd he would protect me from the axe.\n\nBut now he is gone, and I am alone,\n\nAnd I have no one to care for me.\n\nSo I stand here in the forest,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day a wise man will come,\n\nAnd appreciate me for my age and wisdom.\n\nThen I shall be respected once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Stone\n\nI am a stone, hard and enduring,\n\nI was placed in a beautiful garden.\n\nI was admired by all who saw me,\n\nAnd I was part of the landscape.\n\nBut now I am old and moss-covered,\n\nAnd no one admires me any more.\n\nI am left in the garden, forgotten,\n\nAnd I am cracked and worn.\n\nI remember the days when I was new,\n\nAnd how the garden was beautiful.\n\nBut now the garden is overgrown and neglected,\n\nAnd I am surrounded by weeds.\n\nSo I lie here in the garden,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day the garden will be restored,\n\nAnd I shall be admired once more.\n\nThen I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the River\n\nI am a river, flowing endlessly,\n\nI have seen many changes over the years.\n\nI have seen kingdoms rise and fall,\n\nAnd I have seen generations come and go.\n\nBut I keep flowing, day and night,\n\nAnd I never stop.\n\nI remember the days when I was clean and clear,\n\nAnd how the fish swam in my waters.\n\nBut now I am polluted and dirty,\n\nAnd the fish are gone.\n\nSo I flow here, sad and slow,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day I shall be clean again,\n\nAnd the fish will return.\n\nThen I shall flow joyfully once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Mountain\n\nI am a mountain, tall and majestic,\n\nI have stood here for thousands of years.\n\nI have seen many changes,\n\nBut I remain the same.\n\nI remember the days when I was covered with forests,\n\nAnd how the animals lived on my slopes.\n\nBut now I am bare and barren,\n\nAnd the animals are gone.\n\nSo I stand here, lonely and sad,\n\nAnd wait for the end.\n\nBut perhaps one day the forests will grow again,\n\nAnd the animals will return.\n\nThen I shall be majestic once more,\n\nAnd I shall be happy.\n\nThe Song of the Cloud\n\nI am a cloud,\n\nThe rich and toiling, in spring bloom, in autumn fall,\nAre spent like flowers that bloom and fall;\nAnd who can escape the gates of birth and death?\nThey tell of the precious tree in the west\nThat bears the fruit of immortality.\n\nToo Clever by Half\nToo shrewd by half, with such finesse you wrought\nThat your own life in your own toils was caught.\nLonging one moment, the next in despair,\nIn life a heartbroken, in death a vagrant spirit — \nFor all your household’s wealth and your prosperity\nYou end as a scattered household, each one gone his way.\nIn vain you may have hoarded your half-life’s care;\nIt is no more than a midnight dream that fades,\nA great house toppling in a flash,\nA lamp that gutters in the wind.\nAlas I in a trice\nIs joy swallowed in grief.\nHow true that all human affairs are ruled by chance!\n\nLucky Survivor\nLucky the child\nWith a mother kind\nWhose secret deed\nBrought help in time of need.\nLet all men succour the distressed,\nNor mimic that heartless uncle and cousin\nWhose love of silver made them forget their own flesh and blood.\nFor fate\nHas a scale\nAnd heaven will prevail.\n\nGlory in the Evening\nLove in the mirror spent,\nFame in a dream contained —\nHow soon that glorious flower fades I\nNor coverlet’s warmth nor love’s delight remains.\nThis coronet and phoenix robe cannot avert\nThe sudden death that must be undergone.\nThough all men wish to escape poverty in old age,\nThey must do good deeds for their children’s sake.\nProudly the head wears cap and coronet,\nBrightly the breast displays the gold insignia;\nNobly the subject receives high rank and stipend —\nOnly to draw near the dim Yellow Springs I\nAre there no generals or ministers from times past\nWhose fame is only an empty name admired by later men?\n\nThe Good Things Have an End\nFragrant dust on painted beams as springtime ends.\nSeductive, beautiful, the root of the house’s fall.\nJirong’s neglect of his forefather’s trade\nAnd Ning’s depravity were the first cause of its ruin,\nAnd all their retribution sprang from love.\n\nEach Bird Goes to Its Own Roost\nOfficial ranks bring ruined homes;\nWealth and nobility, scattered gold.\nThe kind escape from death;\nThe heartless meet with due reward.\nThose who took a life have paid with their own lives;\nThe tears one owed have all been required in kind.\nNot light the retribution for sins against others;\nPartings and encounters are predestined.\nThose who would know their fate in this life\nNeed only look at the deeds of an earlier one.\nOld age in luxury and honour is true luck.\nThose who see through the world escape from the world;\nInfatuated fools forfeit their lives for nothing.\nWhen the food is gone the birds return to the wood;\nAll that’s left is emptiness and a great void.\n\nAt the end of this song the performers were about to start the next, but Disenchantment, finding Baoyu inattentive, sighed.\n\n‘You silly boy! So you still haven’t come to your senses.’\n\nBaoyu quickly stopped the singers, explaining that he was feeling drowsy and would like to lie down. Disenchantment made them clear away the remains of the feast and led Baoyu into an exquisitely furnished bedchamber the like of which he had never seen before. A sudden shock of surprise brought him wide awake again. For there in the room was a fairy whose rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of Ba-chai, while her delicate grace was that of Daiyu. He was puzzling over this vision when Disenchantment began to speak to him.\n\n‘In the rich and noble households of your mortal world,’ she said, ‘too many of those moonlit scenes in spring, those moments of sweetness and happiness behind the crimson gauze of the bedchamber, are desecrated by acts of licentiousness. And the lewd fancies and dissolute behaviour of all the lascivious lovers of your world are a source of even greater distress. But whereas the carnal pleasures of the ignorant are a mere pandering to the lusts of the flesh, the love of the sentimental voluptuary is of a different and more refined order. It is what we immortals call “lust of the mind”. “Lust of the mind” cannot be explained in words, nor can it be realized in the actual experience of physical love; but if you are to understand the love of the sentimental voluptuary, you must first experience “lust of the mind” for yourself. Because of your natural predisposition to this kind of love, Disenchantment has brought you here today. I have first of all received you as my guest and entertained you with fine tea and wine. I have also regaled you with the music of our twelve fairy-maidens and let you hear the twelve songs of the Dream of Golden Days. But now I am about to make you a special gift. I should like to give you my little sister, whose childish name is Jian-mei and whose style is Ke-qing, to be your bride. This evening, just at the hour when it is getting dark and all is still, you shall consummate your union with her. My motive in arranging this is to help you grasp the fact that, since even in this immortals’ paradise of blissful dalliance the primary purpose of love is the harmonious fusion of minds, how much more must this be so in the polluted world of mortals from which you come. From now on, I hope, you will be able to see through the illusions of the mortal world and change your former nature, devoting your mind seriously to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and your person wholeheartedly to the betterment of society and the governance of the state.’\n\nHaving obtained these two qualities, you may make a good companion in the women’s quarters, but in the world outside you will be thought eccentric and simple-minded, mocked and reviled by all, held in contempt and hated by everyone. Since I have met your ancestors the Dukes of Ningguo and Rongguo and received their solemn injunction, I cannot bear to see you cast out by the world for the sake of the glory you have brought to the women’s quarters. So I have brought you here to feast on choice wine and fragrant tea and listen to fairy music. I have promised you in marriage my sister, a girl with the infant name Ke-qing and the style of Mei-ren. This very night you may consummate the union. It is simply to let you know that even in this fairy abode of illusion such things are permitted, not to speak of the world of men. From now on you must understand the vanity of all things and amend your former ways, fixing your mind on the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and devoting yourself to the principles of moral rectitude and social responsibility.’\n\nAs she concluded, she gave him secret instructions in the art of love and pushed him into the room, closing the door after him and going away on her own.\n\nBao-yu in a daze did exactly as the fairy had instructed him. The details of what he did with Ke-qing we omit as being unsuited to a respectable narrative.\n\nNext day he and Ke-qing were more than ever locked in blissful tenderness, unable to tear themselves apart. As they wandered hand in hand through the fairy precincts, they suddenly found themselves in a place where only briars and brambles grew and wolves and tigers prowled around in pairs. Ahead of them the road ended at the edge of a dark ravine. There was no bridge to cross by. While they were hesitating, Disenchantment suddenly appeared behind them.\n\n‘Halt! No further!’ she cried. ‘Turn back at once!’\n\nBao-yu stopped and asked her, ‘What is this place?’\n\n‘It is the Ford of Error,’ said Disenchantment. ‘It is ten thousand fathoms deep and a thousand li in expanse. No boat can ever cross it. There is only a single raft, piloted by a lay-brother called Mu-gu and poled by a novice called Hui-ken. They ferry across those who are fated to cross, but accept no payment, for their only object is the salvation of mankind. You happened to stray here by accident. If you were to fall in, it would be a great waste of the earnest advice I have been at such pains to give you.’\n\nEven as she spoke, there was a thunderous crashing from the Ford as of a thousand, myriad demons. A host of water monsters and river goblins appeared and made as if to seize Bao-yu and drag him down into the water. He was so frightened that the sweat poured from his body and he cried out in a panic:\n\n‘Cousin Ke-qing! Save me!’\n\nAroma and the other maids were greatly alarmed to hear him calling out in his sleep like this. They hurried over to him and held him:\n\n‘It’s all right, Bao-yu, we’re here! Don’t be afraid!’\n\nNow Qin-shi was outside giving the maids instructions about looking after the cat and dog and making sure they didn’t fight, when she heard Bao-yu call out her infant name in his sleep.\n\n‘I wonder,’ she thought, puzzled, ‘how he came to know my infant name? No one here knows it. How very strange that he should have called it out in his sleep!’\n\nBut to know the reason for this you will have to read the following chapter."
