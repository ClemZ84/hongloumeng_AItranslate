  "original": "话说金桂听了，将脖项一扭，嘴唇一撇，鼻孔里哧哧两声，冷笑道：“菱角花开，谁见香来？若是菱角香了，正经那些香花放在那里？可是不通之极！”香菱道：“不独菱花香，就连荷叶、莲蓬，都是有一般清香的。但他原不是花香可比，若静日静夜或清早半夜细领略了去，那一股清香比是花都好闻呢。就连菱角、鸡头、苇叶、芦根得了风露，那一股清香也是令人心神爽快的。”金桂道：“依你说，这兰花、桂花倒香的不好了？”香菱说到热闹头上，忘了忌讳，便接口道：“兰花、桂花的香，又非别的香可比。”一句未完，金桂的丫鬟名唤宝蟾的，忙指着香菱的脸说道：“你可要死，你怎么叫起姑娘的名字来？”香菱猛省了，反不好意思，忙陪笑说：“一时顺了嘴，奶奶别计较。”金桂笑道：“这有什么，你也太小心了。但只是我想这个‘香’字到底不妥，意思要换一个字，不知你服不服？”香菱笑道：“奶奶说那里话，此刻连我一身一体是奶奶的。何得换一个名字反问我服不服，叫我如何当得起。奶奶说那一个字好，就用那一个。”金桂冷笑道：“你虽说得是，只怕姑娘多心。”香菱笑道：“奶奶原来不知，当日买了我时，原是老太太使唤的，故此姑娘起了这个名字。后来伏侍了爷，就与姑娘无涉了。如今又有了奶奶，越发不与姑娘相干。且姑娘又是极明白的人，如何恼得这些呢？”金桂道：“既这样说，‘香’字竟不如‘秋’字妥当。菱角菱花皆盛于秋，岂不比香字有来历些？”香菱笑道：“就依奶奶这样罢了。”自此后遂改了“秋”字。宝钗亦不在意。\n　　只因薛蟠是天性得陇望蜀的，如今娶了金桂，又见金桂的丫头宝蟾有三分姿色举止轻浮可爱，便时常要茶要水的故意撩逗他。宝蟾虽亦解事，只是怕金桂，不敢造次，且看金桂的眼色。金桂亦觉察其意，想着：“正要摆布香菱，无处寻隙。如今他既看上宝蟾，我且舍出宝蟾与他，他一定就和香菱疏远了。我再乘他疏远之时，摆布了香菱，那时宝蟾原是我的人，也就好处了。”打定了主意，俟机而发。这日薛蟠晚间微醺，又命宝蟾倒茶来吃。薛蟠接碗时故意捏他的手，宝蟾又乔装躲闪，连忙缩手。两下失误，豁啷一声茶碗落地，泼了一身一地的茶。薛蟠不好意思，佯说宝蟾不好生拿着，宝蟾说：“姑爷不好生接。”金桂冷笑道：“两个人的腔调儿都够使的了。别打量谁是傻子！”薛蟠低头微笑不语，宝蟾红了脸出去。一时安歇之时，金桂便故意的撵薛蟠：“别处去睡，省的得了馋痨似的。”薛蟠只是笑。金桂道：“要做什么和我说，别偷偷摸摸的不中用。”薛蟠听了，仗着酒盖脸，就势跪在被上，拉着金桂笑道：“好姐姐，你若把宝蟾赏了我，你要怎样就怎样。你要活人脑子，也弄来给你。”金桂笑道：“这话好不通！你爱谁，说明了，就收在房里，省得别人看着不雅，我可要什么呢。”薛蟠得了这话，喜的称谢不尽。是夜曲尽丈夫之道，竭力奉承金桂。次日他不出门，只在家中厮闹，越发放大了胆了。\n　　至午后，金桂故意出去，让个空儿与他二人，薛蟠便拉拉扯扯的起来。宝蟾心里也知八九了，也就半推半就。正要入港，谁知金桂是有心等候的，料着在难分之际，便叫小丫头子舍儿过来。原来这小丫头也是金桂在家从小使唤的，因他自小父母双亡，无人看管，便大家叫他做小舍儿，专做些粗活。金桂如今有意，独唤他来吩咐道：“你去告诉秋菱，到我屋里，将我的绢子取来，不必说我说的。”小舍儿听了，一径去寻着秋菱，说：“菱姑娘，奶奶的绢子忘记在屋里了，你去取了来，送上去，岂不好？”秋菱正因金桂近日每每的挫折他，不知何意，百般竭力挽回，听了这话，忙往房里来取。不防正遇见他二人推就之际，一头撞进去了，自己倒羞的耳面通红，转身回避不及。薛蟠自为是过了明路的。除了金桂，无人可怕，所以连门也不掩。这会子秋菱撞来，故虽不十分在意，无奈宝蟾素日最是说嘴要强，今既遇见秋菱，便恨无地可入，忙推开薛蟠一径跑了，口内还怨恨不绝，说他强奸力逼。薛蟠好容易哄得上手，却被秋菱打散，不免一腔的兴头变做了一腔的恶怒，都在秋菱身上。不容分说，赶出来啐了两口，骂道：“死娼妇！你这会子做什么来撞尸游魂。”秋菱料事不好，三步两步，早已跑了。薛蟠再来找宝蟾，已无踪迹了。于是只恨的骂秋菱。至晚饭后，已吃得醺醺然，洗澡时，不防水略热了些，烫了脚，便说秋菱有意害他。他赤条精光，赶着秋菱踢打了两下。秋菱虽未受过这气苦，既到了此时，也说不得了，只好自悲自怨，各自走开。\n　　彼时金桂已暗和宝蟾说明，今夜令薛蟠在秋菱房中去成亲，命秋菱过来陪自己安睡。先是秋菱不肯，金桂说他嫌腌了，再必是图安逸，怕夜里伏侍劳动。又骂说：“你没见世面的主子，见一个爱一个，把我的丫头霸占了去，又不叫你来，到底是什么主意？想必是逼死我就罢了！”薛蟠听了这话，又怕闹黄了宝蟾之事，忙又赶来骂秋菱：“不识抬举，再不去就要打了！”秋菱无奈，只得抱了铺盖来。金桂命他在地下铺着睡，秋菱只得依命。刚睡下，便叫倒茶，一时又要捶腿，如是者一夜七八次，总不使其安逸稳卧片时。那薛蟠得了宝蟾，如获珍宝，一概都置之不顾。恨得金桂暗暗的发恨道：“且叫你乐几天，等我慢慢的摆弄了他，那时可别怨我！”一面隐忍，一面设计摆弄秋菱。\n　　半月光景，忽又装起病来，只说心痛难忍，四肢不能转动，疗治不效。众人都说是秋菱气的。闹了两天，忽又从金桂枕头内抖出个纸人来，上面写着金桂的年庚八字，有五根针钉在心窝并肋肢骨缝等处。于是，众人当作新闻，先报与薛姨妈。薛姨妈先忙手忙脚的，薛蟠自然更乱起来，立刻要拷打众人。金桂道：“何必冤枉众人，大约是宝蟾的镇魔法儿。”薛蟠道：“他这些时并没多空儿在你房里，何苦赖好人？”金桂冷笑道：“除了他还有谁？莫不是我自己害自己不成？虽有别人，如何敢进我的房呢？”薛蟠道：“秋菱如今是天天跟着你，他自然知道，先拷问他，就知道了。”金桂冷笑道：“拷问谁？谁肯认？依我说，竟装个不知道，大家丢开手罢了。横竖治死我也没什么要紧，乐得再娶好的。若据良心上说，左不是你三个多嫌我。”一面说着，一面痛哭起来。薛蟠更被这些话激怒，顺手抓起一根门闩来，一径抢步，找着秋菱，不容分说，便劈头劈脸浑身打起来，一口只咬定是秋菱所施。秋菱叫屈。薛姨妈跑来禁喝道：“不问明白就打起人来了，这丫头伏侍这几年，那一时不小心？他岂肯如今做这没良心的事！你且问个清浑皂白，再动粗卤。”金桂听见他婆婆如此说，怕薛蟠心软意活了，便泼声浪气大哭起来，说：“这半个多月，把我的宝蟾霸占了去，不容进我的房，惟有秋菱跟着我睡。我要拷问宝蟾，你又护在头里。你这会子又赌气打他去。治死我，再拣富贵的标致的娶来就是了，何苦做出这些把戏来？”薛蟠听了这些话，越发着了急。\n　　薛姨妈听见金桂句句挟制着儿子，百般恶赖的样子，十分可恨。无奈儿子偏不硬气，已是被他挟制软惯了。如今又勾搭上丫头，被他说霸占了去，自己还要占温柔让夫之礼。这魇魔法究竟不知谁做的？正是俗语说的好，“清官难断家务事”，此时正是公婆难断床帏的事了。因无法，只得赌气喝薛蟠，说：“不争气的孽障，狗也比你体面些！谁知你三不知的把陪房丫头也摸索上了，叫老婆说霸占了丫头，什么脸出去见人！也不知谁使的法子，也不问清就打人。我知道你是个得新弃旧的东西，白辜负了当日的心。他既不好，你也不该打。我即刻叫人牙子来卖了他，你就心净了。”气着，又命：“秋菱，收拾了东西，跟我来。”一面叫人去快叫个人牙子来：“多少卖几两银子，拔去肉中刺、眼中钉，大家过太平日子！”薛蟠见母亲动了气，早已低了头。金桂听了这话，便隔着窗子往外哭道：“你老人家只管卖人，不必说着一个拉着一个的。我们很是那吃醋拈酸容不得下人的不成？怎么‘拔去肉中刺，眼中钉’？是谁的钉？谁的刺？但凡多嫌着他，也不肯把我的丫鬟也收在房里了。”薛姨妈听说，气得身战气咽，道：“这是谁家的规矩？婆婆在这里说话，媳妇隔着窗子拌嘴！亏你是旧人家的女儿，满嘴里大呼小喊，说的是什么！”薛蟠急得跺脚，说：“罢哟，罢哟！看人家听见笑话。”金桂意谓一不做二不休，越发喊起来了，说：“我不怕人笑话！你的小老婆治害我，我倒怕人笑话了？再不然，留下他，卖了我。谁还不知道薛家有钱，行动拿钱垫人，又有好亲戚，挟制着别人！你不趁早施为，还等什么！嫌我不好，谁叫你们瞎了眼，三求四告的，跑了我们家做什么去了！”一面哭喊，一面自己拍打。薛蟠急得说又不好，劝又不好，打又不好，央告又不好，只是出入嗳声叹气，抱怨说运气不好。\n　　当下薛姨妈被宝钗劝进去了，只命人来卖香菱。宝钗笑道：“咱们家只知买人，并不知卖人之说，妈妈可是气糊涂了。倘或叫人听见，岂不笑话？哥哥嫂子嫌他不好，留着我使唤，我正也没人呢。”薛姨妈道：“留下他还是惹气，不如打发了他干净。”宝钗笑道：“他跟着我也是一样，横竖不叫他到前头去。从此，断绝了他那里，也和卖了的一样。”香菱早已跑到薛姨妈跟前，痛哭哀求，不愿出去，情愿跟姑娘。薛姨妈只得罢了。自此，后来香菱果跟随宝钗去了，把前面路径竟自断绝。虽然如此，终不免对月伤悲，挑灯自叹。虽然在薛蟠房中几年，皆因血分中有病，是以并无胎孕。今复加以气怒伤肝，内外折挫不堪，竟酿成干血之症，日渐羸瘦，饮食懒进，请医服药不效。\n　　那时金桂又吵闹了数次，薛蟠有时仗着酒胆，挺撞过两次。持棍欲打，那金桂便递身叫打。这里持刀欲杀时，便伸着脖项。薛蟠也实不能下手，只得乱了一阵罢了。如今已成习惯自然，反使金桂越长威风。又渐次辱嗔宝蟾。宝蟾比不得香菱，正是个烈火干柴，既和薛蟠情投意合，便把金桂放在脑后。近见金桂又作践他，他便不肯低服半点。先是一冲一撞的拌嘴，后来金桂气急，甚至于骂，再至于打。他虽不敢还手，便也撒泼打滚，寻死觅活，昼则刀剪，夜则绳索，无所不闹。薛蟠一身难以两顾，惟徘徊观望，十分闹得无法，便出门躲着。金桂不发作性气，有时喜欢，便纠聚人来斗牌掷骰行乐。又生平最喜啃骨头，每日务要杀鸡鸭，将肉赏人吃，只单是油炸的焦骨头下酒。吃得不耐烦，便肆行海骂，说：“有别的忘八粉头乐的，我为什么不乐。”薛家母女总不去理他，惟暗里落泪。薛蟠亦无别法，惟悔恨不该娶这“搅家精”，都是一时没了主意。于是宁、荣二府之人，上上下下，无有不知，无有不叹者。\n　　此时宝玉已过了百日，出门行走。亦曾过来见过金桂，举止形容也不怪厉，一般是鲜花嫩柳，与众姊妹不差上下，焉得这等情性，可为奇事。因此，心中纳闷。这日，与王夫人请安去，又正遇见迎春奶娘来家请安，说起孙绍祖甚属不端，“姑娘惟有背地里淌眼泪，只要接了家来，散荡两日。”王夫人因说：“我正要这两日接他去，只是七事人事的都不遂心，所以就忘了。前日宝玉去了，回来也曾说过的。明日是个好日子，就接他去。”正说时，贾母打发人来找宝玉，说：“明儿一早往天齐庙还愿去。”宝玉如今巴不得各处去逛逛，听见如此，喜的一夜不曾合眼。\n次日一早，梳洗穿戴已毕，随了两三个老嬷嬷，坐车出西城门外天齐庙烧香还愿。这庙里已于昨日预备停妥的。宝玉天性怯懦，不敢近狰狞神鬼之像，是以忙忙的焚过纸马钱粮，便退至道院歇息。一时吃饭毕，众嬷嬷和李贵等围随宝玉到各处玩耍了一回，宝玉困倦，复回至净室安歇。众嬷嬷生恐他睡着了，便请了当家的老王道士来陪他说话儿。这老道士专在江湖上卖药，弄些海上方治病射利，庙外现挂着招牌，丸散膏药，色色俱备。亦长在宁、荣二府走动惯熟，都给他起了个混号，唤他做“王一贴”，言他膏药灵验，一贴病除。当下王一贴进来。宝玉正歪在炕上，看见王一贴进来，便笑道：“来的好。我听见说你极会说笑话儿的，说一个给我们大家听听。”王一贴笑道：“正是呢，哥儿别睡，仔细肚子里面筋作怪。”说着，满屋里的都笑了，宝玉也笑着起身整衣。王一贴命徒弟们：“快沏好茶来。”焙茗道：“我们爷不吃你的茶，坐在这屋里还嫌膏药气息呢。”王一贴笑道：“不当家花拉的！膏药从不拿进屋里来的。知道二爷今日必来，三五日头里就拿香熏了。”宝玉道：“可是呢，天天只听见说你的膏药好，到底治什么病？”王一贴道：“若问我的膏药，说来话长，其中底细，一言难尽：共药一百二十味，君臣相际，温凉兼用。内则调元补气，养荣卫，开胃口，宁神定魄，去寒去暑，化食化痰；外则和血脉，舒筋络，去死生新，去风散毒。其效如神，贴过便知。”宝玉道：“我不信一张膏药就治这些病？我且问你，倒有一种病，也贴得好么？”王一贴道：“百病千灾，无不立效。若不效，二爷只管揪胡子，打我这老脸，折我这庙何如？只说出病源来。”宝玉道：“你猜。若猜得着，便贴得好了。”王一贴听了，寻思一会，笑道：“这倒难猜，只怕膏药有些不美了。”宝玉命他坐在身边。王一贴心动，便笑着悄悄的说道：“我可猜着了。想是二爷如今有了房中的事情，要滋助的药可是不是？”话犹未完，焙茗先喝道：“该死，打嘴！”宝玉犹未解，忙问：“他说什么？”焙茗道：“信他胡说！”唬得王一贴不等再问，只说：“二爷明说了罢。”宝玉道：“我问你，可有贴女人的妒病的方子没有？”王一贴听了，拍手笑道：“这可罢了，不但说没有方子，就是听也没有听见过。”宝玉笑道：“这样还算不得什么！”王一贴又忙道：“这贴妒的膏药倒没经过。有一种汤药，或者可医，只是慢些儿，不能立刻见效的。”宝玉道：“什么汤？怎样吃法？”\n    王一贴道：“这叫做‘疗妒汤’：用极好的秋梨一个，二钱冰搪，一钱陈皮，水三碗，梨熟为度。每日清晨吃这一个梨，吃来吃去就好了。”宝玉道：“这也不值什么。只怕未必见效。”王一贴道：“一剂不效，吃十剂，今日不效，明日再吃；今年不效，明年再吃。横竖这三味药都是润肺开胃不伤人的，甜丝丝的，又止咳嗽，又好吃。吃过一百岁，人横竖是要死的，死了还妒什么？那时就见效了。”说着，宝玉、焙茗都大笑不止，骂“油嘴的牛头”。王一贴道：“不过是闲着解午盹罢了，有什么关系？说笑了你们就值钱。告诉你们说，连膏药也是假的。我有真药，我还吃了做神仙呢。有真的跑到这里来混？”正说着，吉时已到，请宝玉出去奠酒，焚化钱粮，散福。功课完毕，宝玉方进城回家。\n　　那时迎春已来家好半日，孙家婆娘媳妇等人已待晚饭，打发回家去了。迎春方哭哭啼啼，在王夫人房中诉委屈，说：“孙绍祖一味好色，好赌，酗酒，家中所有的媳妇丫头，将及淫遍。略劝过两三次，便骂我是‘醋汁子老婆拧出来的’。又说老爷曾收着五千银子，不该使了他的。如今他来要了两三次不得，便指着我的脸说道：‘你别和我充夫人娘子！你老子使了我五千银子，把你准折卖给我的。好不好，打你一顿。撵到下房里睡去。当日有你爷爷在时，希冀上我们的富贵，赶着相与的。论理我和你父亲是一辈，如今压着我的头，晚了一辈，不该做了这门亲，倒没的叫人看着赶势利似的。’”一行说，一行哭的呜呜咽咽，连王夫人并众妹妹无不落泪。王夫人只得用言解劝，说：“已是遇见不晓事的人，可怎么样呢。想当日你叔叔也曾劝过大老爷，不叫做这门亲的，大老爷执意不听，一心情愿，到底做不好了。我的儿，这也是你的命。”迎春哭道：“我不信我的命就这么苦，从小儿没有娘，幸而过婶娘这边来，过了几年心净日子。如今偏又是这么个结果。”王夫人一面劝，一面问他随意要在那里安歇。迎春道：“乍乍的离了姊妹们，只是眠思梦想，二则还惦记着我的屋子，还得在园里住个三五天，死也甘心了。不知下次来还得住不得住了呢。”王夫人忙劝道：“快休乱说。年轻的夫妻们，斗牙斗齿，也是泛泛人的常事，何必说这些丧话？”仍命人忙忙的收拾紫菱洲房屋，命妹妹们陪伴着解释。又吩咐宝玉：“不许在老太太跟前走漏一些风声。倘或老太太知道了这些事，都是你说的。”宝玉唯唯的听命。迎春是夕仍在旧馆安歇。众姐妹丫鬟等更加亲热异常。一连住了三日，才往邢夫人那边去。先辞过贾母及王夫人，然后与众姐妹分别，各皆悲伤不舍。还是王夫人薛姨妈等安慰劝释，方止住了，过那边去。又在邢夫人处住了两日，就有孙家的人来接去。迎春虽不愿去，无奈孙绍祖之恶，勉强忍情作辞去了。邢夫人本不在意，也不问其夫妻和睦、家务烦难，只面情塞责而已。\n要知后事，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jingui, at this, twisted her neck, pursed her lips and snorted.\n\n“Do caltrop flowers have any scent?” she sneered. “If they have, what becomes of all the real fragrant flowers? That’s utter nonsense!”\n\n“It’s not only the caltrop flower,” Xangling assured her. “Even the lotus leaf and seed-pod have a delicate fragrance. Of course it’s different from the scent of flowers. But if you savour it carefully on a quiet day or night, in the early morning or at midnight, that delicate fragrance is sweeter than any flower’s. Even the leaves and roots of caltrops, gorgon fruit, reeds and rushes, steeped in dew and wind, have a fresh scent which is most refreshing.”\n\n“Do you mean to say then that orchids and cassia aren’t fragrant?”\n\nCarried away by this discussion, Xangling forgot herself and retorted, “The fragrance of orchids and cassia can’t compare with that of other flowers....”\n\nShe had not finished when Jingui’s maid Baochan pointed a finger at her.\n\n“You must want to die!” she cried. “How dare you call the young mistress by her name?”\n\nXangling, flushing in dismay, promptly begged Jingui’s pardon. “It was a slip of the tongue, madam. Please don’t take offence.”\n\nJingui laughed. “Why should I? You’re over-sensitive. But it seems to me this name ‘Xiangling’ is most unsuitable. I’d like to change it. I wonder if you’ll agree to that?”\n\n“How can you say such a thing, madam?” Xangling smiled. “I belong to you now, body and soul. Why ask if I’m willing to have my name changed? How could I presume to object? Whatever name you choose will do.”\n\n“That’s all very well, but I’m afraid the young lady may be angry.”\n\n“You don’t understand, madam. When I was bought the old lady meant to keep me for her own use, so the young lady gave me this name. But later, when I started serving the master, that had nothing to do with her. And now that you’re here, madam, of course it’s still less her concern. Besides, she’s very understanding. Why should she be annoyed?”\n\n“In that case,” said Jingui, “instead of ‘Xiang’ I think ‘Qiu’ would be more appropriate. Both caltrops and caltrop flowers are at their best in autumn, so isn’t that more to the point?”\n\n“Very well, madam, let it be Qiu.”\n\nAnd Baochai raised no objection to the change.\n\nNow Xue Pan was a man whose lust was never satisfied. Having married Jingui, he was attracted by her maid Baochan’s rather seductive ways and her free and easy manner. He often flirted with her on the pretext of asking her to fetch him tea or water. Though Baochan was amenable she was afraid of her mistress and dared not take liberties, having to wait for a sign from her. Jingui for her part was well aware of this.\n\n“I’ve been meaning to squash Xiangling but couldn’t find a chance,” she thought. “If he’s taken a fancy to Baochan, I’ll let him have her and then he’s bound to cold-shoulder Xiangling. I can take it out on her when he’s turned against her. As Baochan’s my girl, that should be all right too.”\n\nHaving decided on this plan she waited for a chance to put it into execution.\n\nOne evening when Xue Pan was slightly tipsy he called for Baochan to bring him tea. As he took the cup he purposely pinched her hand. She made a show of eluding him and quickly withdrew it. In the scuffle, the cup fell to the ground and tea splashed all over the floor and his clothes. Ashamed of himself, he blamed her for not handing it to him properly.\n\n“You didn’t take it properly, sir,” she retorted.\n\nJingui smiled sarcastically. “You’re a fine pair, I must say! Don’t think you can fool me.”\n\nXue Pan lowered his head with a sheepish smile while Baochan fled blushing.\n\nWhen it was time to retire, Jingui purposely chased him away.\n\n“Sleep somewhere else,” she said. “I don’t want you lusting after me like a starved ghost.”\n\nHe simply grinned.\n\n“If you want anything, come and tell me,” she scolded. “What’s the use of sneaking around like that?”\n\nFlushed with wine, he knelt on the bedding and caught hold of Jin-gui.\n\n“Dear sister,” he coaxed, “if you’ll give me Bao-chan, I’ll do whatever you want. If you want a living man’s brains I’ll get them for you.”\n\n“What nonsense!” She giggled. “If you’ve taken a fancy to her, out with it and take her as your concubine. It doesn’t look nice the other way. But what do I want with her?”\n\nXue Pan was overjoyed by this.\n\n“Thanks a million!” he cried.\n\nThat night he played the husband to perfection, doing his best to please her. The next day he stayed at home fooling about, growing even bolder.\n\nAfter lunch Jin-gui went out on purpose to leave the two of them alone, and Xue Pan started dallying with Bao-chan, who by now had a pretty good idea of the situation and put up only a half-hearted struggle. They were on the point of getting down to business when Jin-gui, who had been waiting for this, sent in a young maid called Shere — so named because she had lost both parents as a child and had no one to look after her. Jin-gui had brought her from her home to do rough work. Now she called the child in and instructed her:\n\n“Go and tell Caltrop to fetch my handkerchief from my room. Don’t say I sent you.”\n\nShere went to find Caltrop and said, “Miss Caltrop, the mistress has left her handkerchief in her room. Will you fetch it and take it to her? That would be a good deed, wouldn’t it?”\n\nCaltrop had been wondering how to please Jin-gui, who had been finding fault with her recently for no reason at all. Eager to oblige, she hurried to her room — and burst in on the two of them in each other’s arms. Blushing crimson to the ears, she turned to flee but could not hide her embarrassment.\n\nXue Pan, assuming that his wife had given her consent and he had nothing to fear from anyone but her, had not even closed the door. He was not too put out by Caltrop’s intrusion, but Bao-chan was a girl who liked to show off and talk big. The sight of Caltrop made her wish the earth would swallow her up. She pushed Xue Pan away and ran off, loudly protesting that he had tried to rape her.\n\nXue Pan, who had had great difficulty in talking her round, was furious with Caltrop for interrupting them. He rushed out and spat in her face.\n\n“You bitch!” he swore. “Why must you come haunting this room like a ghost?”\n\nCaltrop, sensing trouble, took to her heels. When Xue Pan went back to look for Bao-chan she had disappeared. He could only curse Caltrop. After supper that evening, by which time he was tipsy again, when he took a bath the water happened to be rather hot and scalded his feet. He swore that Caltrop had done this on purpose to injure him. Naked as he was, he kicked her a couple of times. Though unaccustomed to such treatment, there was nothing she could do about it but weep in silence and keep out of his way.\n\nJin-gui had told Bao-chan secretly that she meant to send Xue Pan to sleep in Caltrop’s room that night, and ordered Caltrop to come and sleep with her. When Caltrop refused, Jin-gui accused her of finding her dirty or of being lazy and not wanting to have to wait on her at night. She scolded:\n\n“You’re like all ignorant young mistresses, falling for every man you set eyes on. Why should you hog my maid and not come to me? What are you up to? Do you want to drive me to my death?”\n\nXue Pan, afraid this might ruin his chances with Bao-chan, promptly swore at Caltrop.\n\n“You don’t know what’s good for you!” he fumed. “If you don’t go, I’ll beat you.”\n\nSo Caltrop had to take her bedding to Jin-gui’s room, where she was told to spread it on the floor — an order which she obeyed. No sooner had she lain down than Jin-gui called for tea. A little later she wanted her legs massaged. Seven or eight times in the night she made these demands, never letting Caltrop sleep in peace for a single moment. As for Xue Pan, he felt as if he had found a rare treasure.\n\nBut Jin-gui, who had been secretly gnashing her teeth with rage, decided to bide her time.\n\n“I’ll let you enjoy yourself for a few days,” she thought. “Wait till I’ve\nsettled her hash — then don’t blame me for being ruthless.”\n\nShe restrained her anger while plotting how to torment Caltrop.\n\nAbout a fortnight later, she suddenly feigned illness, complaining of such\nexcruciating pains in her heart that she could not move her limbs. No\ntreatment did her any good. Everybody said that Caltrop had driven her to\nthis. Then, two days later, a paper effigy was shaken out of her pillow with\nJin-gui’s date and hour of birth written on it, and five pins stuck into the\nheart and the joints of the limbs. This was reported as a sensational piece\nof news to Aunt Xue, who was most alarmed and Xue Pan even more so. He\nwanted to have all the servants tortured to confess, but Jin-gui said:\n\n“Why make out that they’re to blame? Most likely it was Moon Cakes who\nworked this magic on me.”\n\n“She hasn’t had much chance to come to your room recently,” he objected.\n“Why wrong an innocent person?”\n\n“If not her, who else?” she sneered. “Do you imagine I’d do such a thing to\nmyself? Even if there is anyone else, who would dare come into my room?”\n\n“Caltrop’s with you every day. She must know. If we torture her we’ll find\nout.”\n\n“Torture her? Who’s going to own up? My advice is to pretend not to know\nand just drop it. After all, it doesn’t matter if I’m killed; you can\nhappily marry a better wife. But to be fair, I suppose it’s because the\nthree of you find me in the way.”\n\nShe started sobbing.\n\nXue Pan in a rage grabbed a door-bar and rushed to find Caltrop. Without a\nword he started beating her all over, swearing that she must have worked this\nmagic. Caltrop pleaded her innocence.\n\nAunt Xue ran over to stop him.\n\n“How can you beat her without first getting to the bottom of this?” she\nscolded. “This girl has waited on you for years, and has always been careful.\nHow could she do such a wicked thing now? You must get this straight before\nlosing your temper.”\n\nWhen Jin-gui heard her mother-in-law taking this line, she was afraid Xue Pan\nmight give in. She started sobbing and wailing.\n\n“For more than a fortnight now he’s kept Moon Cakes from me, not letting her\ncome to my room, so that I’ve only had Caltrop to sleep with me. When I\nwanted to question Moon Cakes, he protected her. And now in a fit of anger\nhe’s beating Caltrop. He wants to kill me so that he can marry someone rich\nand beautiful. Why bother to put on such a show?”\n\nThis made Xue Pan fly into a greater rage.\n\nAunt Xue, exasperated by the way Jin-gui incited her son against others and\nacted so disgracefully, was disgusted. But her wretched son was so spineless\nand so under his wife’s thumb that he had taken up with her maid, and now she\nwas accusing him of keeping Moon Cakes from her — she who posed as a gentle,\ndutiful wife! Who could have worked this magic? As the proverb says, “Not\neven good officials can settle family troubles.” How much less could a mother\ndecide a quarrel between her son and his wife! In desperation she shouted at\nXue Pan:\n\n“You degenerate! Even a dog is more dignified. Who’d have thought you’d carry\non with your wife’s maid, letting her accuse you of keeping the girl from\nher? How can you hold up your head in public? You don’t know who worked this\nmagic, yet you start beating people. I know you — you’re the type that loves\nthe new and loathes the old. You’ve no constancy. Even if she’s no good, you\nshouldn’t beat her. I’m sending at once for a slave-dealer to sell her. That\nwill set your mind at rest.”\n\nIn her anger she told Caltrop, “Pack your things and come with me.” And she\nordered a servant, “Go quickly and fetch a dealer. We’ll sell her for\nwhatever we can get, to rid us of this thorn in the flesh, this eyesore, so\nthat we can all have some peace.”\n\nXue Pan hung his head at this. And when Jin-gui heard that Caltrop was to be\nsold she forthwith dried her tears and made herself up, reflecting that once\nthe girl had been sold there would be no one to interfere with her. So she\nurged Xue Pan to lose no time in getting another concubine.\n\nShe shouted tearfully through the window, “Just sell her and have done with it. There’s no need to drag me in. Do you take me for a jealous shrew who can’t tolerate anyone? What do you mean by ‘pulling out the thorn in your flesh and the nail in your eye’? Whose nail? Whose thorn? If he’d found her so impossible, would he have taken my maid as his concubine too?”\n\nAunt Hsueh was quivering with rage. “Such goings-on!” she gasped. “A daughter-in-law shouting through the window to bandy words with her mother-in-law! And you a girl from a good family too — what a way to carry on!”\n\nHsueh Pan stamped his foot in desperation. “That’s enough!” he cried. “Do you want to make a laughing-stock of us?”\n\nChin-kuei was determined to go the whole hog. “I don’t care if people laugh at us!” she shrieked. “Your concubine ill-treats me, yet you’re afraid of being laughed at? If you won’t sell her, then sell me! Everybody knows the Hsuehs are rolling in money and can bribe anyone. They have powerful relatives too, and can put pressure on people. If you’re going to do it, do it quickly. What are you waiting for? If I’m not good enough for you, why were you so blind as to come time and again to beg for my hand?”\n\nShe wept, shouted and thumped herself. Hsueh Pan in desperation could neither reason with her nor silence her by threats or entreaties. He simply stamped in and out, sighing and cursing his bad luck.\n\nBy now Aunt Hsueh had been persuaded to go inside by Pao-chai, and she simply sent to have Hsiang-ling sold.\n\n“Our family only buys servants, we’ve never sold any,” said Pao-chai with a smile. “You must be beside yourself with anger, mother. If word of this got out, wouldn’t people laugh at us? If my brother and sister-in-law find Hsiang-ling unsatisfactory, let her work for me. I’ve no one to help me anyway.”\n\n“If we keep her she’ll only make more trouble. Better get rid of her once and for all.”\n\n“It will be the same if she stays with me. I won’t let her go to the front court, so she’ll be completely cut off from my brother — the same as being sold.”\n\nHsiang-ling had run over to fall on her knees before Aunt Hsueh. Weeping, she begged not to be sent away but allowed to serve the young lady. So Aunt Hsueh had to let the matter drop.\n\nAfter that Hsiang-ling went to wait on Pao-chai and never went back to the front court. But though she had escaped being sold she could not help grieving often in private over her hard lot. During the years she had spent in Hsueh Pan’s household, because of some blood disorder she had never conceived; and now, what with anger and frustration which injured her liver, and the rough treatment she had received, this developed into consumption. She grew thinner every day and had no appetite. All the doctors could do was to prescribe tonics which proved of no avail.\n\nChin-kueh raised several more storms. Sometimes, emboldened by wine, Hsueh Pan would stand up to her and even threaten her with a stick; but when she pressed against him to let him beat her, or stretched out her neck for him to cut it with a knife, he could not bring himself to do it and after all the bluster the storm would subside. They were both getting used to this, and Chin-kuei became more domineering than ever. She also started venting her spite on Pao-chan.\n\nNow Pao-chan was a very different proposition from Hsiang-ling. A firebrand herself, she was on the best of terms with Hsueh Pan and had no time for Chin-kuei. When the latter started bullying her she refused to take it lying down. At first she would answer back, and later, when Chin-kuei lost her temper and swore at her or beat her, not daring to hit back she would roll on the ground crying that she wanted to die, and make scenes by brandishing a knife or scissors by day or demanding a rope at night. Hsueh Pan, unable to cope with both of them, could only look on in dismay. When things got too hot for him he would go out.\n\nIf Chin-kuei was not in a temper she would amuse herself by gathering people together to play cards or dice. And she had a passion for gnawing bones. She insisted on having chickens or ducks killed every day, then would give the meat to others to eat while she herself savoured only the fried bones with her wine. When she had nothing better to do she would start cursing wildly.\n\n“Don’t think I don’t know what goes on,” she would fume. “I’m not a fool. There are other turtle-eggs and strumpets for him to amuse himself with....”\n\n\"Why shouldn’t I be happy?\" Aunt Xue and her daughter ignored her, simply weeping in secret. And Xue Pan could think of no way out either, repenting only of having married this \"trouble-maker\" in a moment of folly. The whole Rong and Ning households, high and low, knew of this and deplored it.\n\nBy now, Baoyu had completed the hundred days of mourning and could go out. He had called to see Jingui, and as she struck him as neither fierce nor strange but as pretty and charming as his other girl cousins, he was amazed that she should have such a shocking disposition. It puzzled him.\n\nOne day, when he went to pay his respects to Lady Wang, Yingchun’s nurse came to ask after her mistress. She reported that Sun Shaozu was behaving disgracefully.\n\n\"The young lady can only weep in secret,\" she said. \"She hopes you will fetch her home for a couple of days’ relaxation.\"\n\n\"I’ve been meaning to send for her these last few days,\" replied Lady Wang. \"But so many things have cropped up, it slipped my mind. The other day, after Baoyu’s visit there, he told me about it. Tomorrow is a lucky day, so we’ll send to fetch her.\"\n\nJust then the Lady Dowager sent to summon Baoyu, saying, \"Tomorrow morning early he must go to offer thanks at the Tianqi Temple.\" As Baoyu was eager to go out and about, this made him so happy that he did not sleep a wink all night.\n\nThe next morning, having washed and dressed, he went with some old nurses by carriage to offer incense and give thanks at the Tianqi Temple outside the West Gate. Preparations there had been made the previous day. Being of a timid disposition and afraid of the ferocious idols, Baoyu lost no time in burning his paper offerings and money, then withdrew to a cloister to rest. After a meal, the nurses and Li Gui took him to stroll through the grounds. When he felt tired he went back to the quiet room to rest, and the nurses, afraid he might fall asleep, sent for the chief priest of the temple, Wang, to keep him company.\n\nThis old priest, who peddled drugs all over the place and made money by selling so-called wonder-working prescriptions, had a signboard outside the temple listing all the pills, powders and plasters he had for sale. Being a familiar figure in the Rong and Ning Mansions they had given him the nickname \"King of Plasters,\" meaning that one of his plasters would cure any complaint.\n\nWhen he came in, Baoyu was reclining on the couch. At sight of the priest he chuckled.\n\n\"You’ve come just at the right time,\" he said. \"I hear you’re a great hand at telling jokes. Tell us one.\"\n\n\"Quite right too,\" replied Wang. \"Don’t go to sleep, sir, or you may get cramp in your tummy.\"\n\nThis raised a laugh from everyone present, and Baoyu laughed too as he stood up and straightened his clothes.\n\nWang told his novices, \"Make good tea quickly.\"\n\nMingyan retorted, \"We don’t want your tea. Sitting in this room, we can’t stand the stink of your plasters.\"\n\n\"Don’t talk nonsense,\" said Wang. \"I never bring any plasters in here. Knowing that the young gentleman was coming today, I had the place fumigated with incense three or four days ago.\"\n\n\"That’s right,\" put in Baoyu. \"I’m always hearing how good your plasters are. What illnesses do they really cure?\"\n\n\"If you want to know about my plasters, there’s a long story about them. It’s hard to explain in a few words. The ingredients include all sorts of tonics and restoratives to build up resistance, stimulate the appetite, quiet the nerves, regulate the blood and the circulation, counteract heat and cold, help digestion and reduce phlegm. Used externally, they stimulate the muscles, promote the growth of flesh and skin, and dispel cold and poison. The effect is miraculous — you have only to try one to see.\"\n\n\"I don’t believe one plaster can cure so many different diseases,\" objected Baoyu. \"I’ll ask you another question: is there one that can cure a particular illness?\"\n\n\"It cures every ailment. If it doesn’t, you can pull out my beard and slap my old face, and smash up this temple of mine. Just tell me what’s wrong.\"\n\n\"Guess. If you guess right, that’ll prove your skill.\"\n\n\"If it’s a good plaster you want, I’ve got it.” After a moment’s thought Wang Yitie smiled. “I can’t guess, I’m afraid. Maybe a plaster’s not the thing.”\n\nBaoyu made him sit down beside him. Wang Yitie had an inspiration.\n\n“I’ve got it!” he whispered with a smile. “I suppose now that you have chamber duties, you want some tonic. Is that it?”\n\nBefore he could finish, Beiming swore, “Damn you! Hold your tongue!”\n\nBaoyu, not having understood, asked, “What did he say?”\n\n“Don’t listen to his nonsense!”\n\nThis so alarmed Wang Yitie that he cut in, “Tell me what you want, young master.”\n\n“I want to know if you have a prescription to cure women of jealousy.”\n\nWang clapped his hands and chuckled.\n\n“That lets me out! Not only have I no such prescription, I’ve never even heard of one.”\n\n“In that case you’re not much good,” retorted Baoyu.\n\n“I may not have a plaster to cure jealousy, but I do know of a decoction which may do the trick. Only it’s slow to take effect; it doesn’t work right away.”\n\n“What decoction? How is it prepared?”\n\n“You take one good autumn pear, two ounces of crystal sugar, one ounce of dried tangerine peel, and boil them in four bowls of water till the pear is pulpy. Every morning eat one such pear as a tonic, and in time you’ll be cured.”\n\n“That’s nothing. I doubt if it’s any use.”\n\n“If one dose doesn’t cure you, take ten. If it doesn’t work today, try again tomorrow. If it doesn’t work this year, try next. These three ingredients are harmless, good for the lungs, and they improve the digestion. They’re sweet to the taste too, and stop coughing. You can go on taking them till you’re a hundred — we’ve all got to die some day, and once you’re dead what is there to be jealous about? Then you’ll see how effective it is!”\n\nAt that Baoyu and Beiming burst out laughing and cursed him as a glib old quack.\n\n“I was just joking to pass the time,” said Wang. “What does it matter? It’s worth it to have given you a laugh. I may as well tell you, even my plasters are fakes. If I had the real stuff, I’d have taken it long ago to become an immortal. Why should I hawk it around here?”\n\nJust then it was announced that the auspicious hour had come for Baoyu to go out and offer libations, burn paper money and distribute offerings. Not till these ceremonies had been performed did he return to the city and go home.\n\nYingchun had come back some time earlier. The Sun family’s servants, having waited to have supper, had been sent home. Now Yingchun, in tears, was telling Lady Wang how she had been wronged.\n\n“Sun Shaozu is a rake, a gambler and a drunkard,” she sobbed. “He’s debauched practically all the maids and serving-women in the house. When I ventured a couple of remonstrations, he swore I’d been pickled in vinegar and called me a jealous bitch. He also said that my father had taken five thousand taels of his silver which he ought not to have done, and now that he’s asked for it several times in vain, he pointed his finger at my face and swore, ‘Don’t you put on airs here as my wife! Your father took five thousand taels from me, and that’s the price he sold you for. If you don’t behave, I’ll give you a thrashing and send you to sleep in the servants’ quarters!\n\n“‘In your grandfather’s time you were only too eager to cultivate us because we were noble and rich. Actually, I’m your father’s generation. Now he’s put one over on me by making me his son-in-law, which lowers me by one generation. This marriage should never have taken place. It makes people think I’m toadying to your family.’”\n\nAs she sobbed out this account, Lady Wang and the girls could not help weeping too.\n\n“There’s nothing to be done, you’ve fallen into the hands of a brute,” said Lady Wang. “Your uncle did advise your father against this match, but he was set on it and went his own way. So now it’s turned out badly. My child, this is your fate.”\n\n“I don’t believe it’s my fate,” wept Yingchun.\n\n“Her life is so hard!” she sighed. “Losing her mother as a child, she was lucky to come here and have a few years of peace. And now this has to happen to her!”\n\nLady Wang urged her not to worry and asked where she would like to stay.\n\n“Leaving my cousins so suddenly, I shall miss them terribly,” said Yingchun. “And I long to see my old rooms too. I’d be content to die if I could spend just a few more days in the Garden. Who knows if I shall ever be able to stay here again?”\n\n“Don’t talk like that!” begged Lady Wang. “All young couples have their tiffs. It’s nothing to worry about. Why harp on dying?” She ordered the rooms at Purple Caltrop Isle to be made ready and maids to keep Yingchun company and cheer her up, warning Pao-yu, “Mind you don’t breathe a word of this to the old lady. If she hears of it we’ll know it came from you.”\n\nPao-yu had to agree to this.\n\nThat night Yingchun slept in her old apartments, and all her cousins and the maids were more cordial to her than ever. After three days there she went back to Lady Hsing’s quarters. First she took her leave of the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, then of her cousins. They were all very loath to part with her, and it took Lady Wang and Aunt Hsueh to comfort them and stop their lamentations. Yingchun went to Lady Hsing’s place for a couple of days, after which the Sun family sent to fetch her. Although unwilling to go she had to submit to Sun Shao-tsu’s tyranny and control herself. Lady Hsing, not concerned in any case, did not trouble to ask whether the young couple were on good terms or if she had any domestic problems, but simply observed the formalities.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
