  "original": "话说贾母王夫人去后，姐妹们复进园来吃饭。那刘老老带着板儿，先来见凤姐儿说：“明日一早定要家去了。虽然住了两三天，日子却不多，把古往今来没见过的、没吃过的、没听见的都经验过了。难得老太太和姑奶奶并那些小姐们，连各房里的姑娘们，都这样怜贫惜老照看我。我这一回去没别的报答，惟有请些高香，天天给你们念佛，保佑你们长命百岁的，就算我的心了。”凤姐儿笑道：“你别喜欢，都是为你，老太太也叫风吹病了，躺着嚷不舒服；我们大姐儿也着了凉了，在那里发热呢。”刘老老听了，忙叹道：“老太太有年纪了，不惯十分劳乏的。”凤姐儿道：“从来不象昨儿高兴。往常也进园子逛去，不过到一两处坐坐就来了。昨儿因为你在这里，要叫都逛逛，一个园子倒走了多半个。大姐儿因为我找你去，太太递了一块糕给他，谁知风地里吃了，就发起热来。”刘老老道：“姐姐儿只怕不大进园子。比不得我们的孩子，一会走，那个坟圈子里不跑去？一则风拍了也是有的，二则只怕他身上干净，眼睛又净，或是遇见什么神了。依我说，给他瞧瞧祟书本子，仔细撞客着。”一语提醒了凤姐儿，便叫平儿拿出《玉匣记》来，叫彩明来念。彩明翻了一会子，念道：“八月二十五日病者，东南方得之，有溢死家亲女鬼作祟，又遇花神。用五色纸钱四十张，向东南方四十步送之大吉。”凤姐儿笑道：“果然不错，园子里头可不是花神！只怕老太太也是遇见了。”一面命人请两分纸钱来，着两个人来，一个与贾母送祟，一个与大姐儿送祟，果见大姐儿安稳睡了。\n　　凤姐儿笑道：“到底是你们有年纪的经历的多。我们大姐儿时常肯病，也不知是什么原故。”刘老老道：“这也有的。富贵人家养的孩子都娇嫩，自然禁不得一些儿委屈。再他小人儿家，过于尊贵了也禁不起。以后姑奶奶倒少疼他些就好了。”凤姐儿道：“也是有的。我想起来，他还没个名字，你就给他起个名字，借借你的寿；二则你们是庄家人，不怕你恼，到底贫苦些，你们贫苦人起个名字只怕压的住。”刘老老听说，便想了一想，笑道：“不知他是几时养的？”凤姐儿道：“正是养的日子不好呢：可巧是七月初七日。”刘老老忙笑道：“这个正好，就叫做巧姐儿好。这个叫做‘以毒攻毒，以火攻火’的法子。姑奶奶定依我这名字，必然长命百岁。日后大了，各人成家立业，或一时有不遂心的事，必然遇难成祥，逢凶化吉，都从这‘巧’字儿来。”凤姐儿听了，自是欢喜，忙谢道：“只保佑他应了你的话就好了。”说着，叫平儿来吩咐道：“明儿咱们的事，恐怕不得闲儿，你这会子闲着，把送老老的东西打点了，他明儿一早就走的便宜了。”刘老老道：“不敢多破费了。已经遭扰了几天，又拿着走，越发心里不安了。”凤姐儿笑道：“也没有什么，不过随常的东西。好也罢，歹也罢，带了去，你们街坊邻舍看着也热闹些，也是上城一趟。”说着，只见平儿走来说：“老老过这边瞧瞧。”刘老老忙跟了平儿到那边屋里，只见堆着半炕东西。平儿一一的拿给他瞧着，又说道：“这是昨日你要的青纱一匹，奶奶另外送你一个实地月白纱做里子。这是两个茧绸，做袄儿裙子都好。这包袱里是两匹绸子，年下做件衣裳穿。这是一盒子各样内造小饽饽儿，也有你吃过的，也有没吃过的，拿去摆碟子请人，比买的强些。这两条口袋是你昨日装果子的，如今这一个里头装了两斗御田粳米，熬粥是难得的；这一条里头是园子里的果子和各样干果子。这一包是八两银子。这都是我们奶奶的。这两包每包五十两，共是一百两，是太太给的，叫你拿去，或者做个小本买卖，或者置几亩地，以后再别求亲靠友的。”说着又悄悄笑道：“这两件袄儿和两条裙子，还有四块包头，一包绒线，可是我送老老的。那衣裳虽是旧的，我也没大很穿，你要弃嫌，我就不敢说了。”\n　　平儿说一样，刘老老念一句佛，已经念了几千佛了；又见平儿也送他这些东西，又如此谦逊，忙笑道：“姑娘说那里话？这样好东西，我还弃嫌！我就有银子，没处买这样的去呢。只是我怪臊的，收了不好，不收又辜负了姑娘的心。”平儿笑道：“别说外话，咱们都是自己，我才这么着。你放心收了罢，我还和你要东西呢。到年下，你只把你们晒的那个灰条菜和豇豆、扁豆、茄子干子、葫芦条儿，各样干菜带些来——我们这里上上下下都爱吃这个——就算了，别的一概不要，别罔费了心。”刘老老千恩万谢的答应了。平儿道：“你只管睡你的去，我替你收拾妥当了，就放在这里，明儿一早打发小厮们雇辆车装上，不用你费一点心儿。”刘老老越发感激不尽，过来又千恩万谢的辞了凤姐儿，过贾母这边睡了一夜。次早梳洗了就要告辞。\n　　因贾母欠安，众人都过来请安，出去传请大夫。一时婆子回：“大夫来了。”老嬷嬷请贾母进幔子去坐，贾母道：“我也老了，那里养不出那阿物儿来，还怕他不成，不用放幔子，就这样瞧罢。”众婆子听了，便拿过一张小桌子来，放下一个小枕头，便命人请。一时只见贾珍、贾琏、贾蓉三个人，将王太医领来。王太医不敢走甬路，只走旁阶，跟着贾珍到了台阶上。早有两个婆子在两边打起帘子，两个婆子在前导引进去，又见宝玉迎接出来。见贾母穿着青绉绸一斗珠儿的羊皮褂子，端坐在榻上。两边四个未留头的小丫鬟，都拿着蝇刷漱盂等物，又有五六个老嬷嬷雁翅摆在两旁。碧纱厨后，隐隐约约有许多穿红着绿、戴宝插金的人，王太医也不敢抬头，忙上来请了安。贾母见他穿着六品服色，便知是御医了，含笑问：“供奉好？”因问贾珍：“这位供奉贵姓？”贾珍等忙回：“姓王。”贾母笑道：“当日太医院正堂有个王君效，好脉息。”王太医忙躬身低头含笑，因说：“那是晚生家叔祖。”贾母听了笑道：“原来这样，也算是世交了。”一面说，一面慢慢的伸手放在小枕头上。嬷嬷端着一张小杌子放在小桌前面，略偏些。王太医便盘着一条腿儿坐下，歪着头诊了半日，又诊了那只手，忙欠身低头退出。贾母笑说：“劳动了。珍哥让出去，好生看茶。”贾珍、贾琏等忙答应了几个“是”，复领王太医到外书房中。王太医说：“太夫人并无别症，偶感了些风寒，其实不用吃药，不过略清淡些，常暖着点儿就好了。如今写个方子在这里，若老人家爱吃，便按方煎一剂吃；若懒怠吃，也就罢了。”说着，吃茶，写了方子。刚要告辞，只见奶子抱了大姐出来，笑说：“王老爷也瞧瞧我们。”王太医听说，忙起身就奶子怀中，左手托着大姐儿的手，右手诊了一诊，又摸了一摸头，又叫伸出舌头来瞧，笑道：“我要说了，妞儿该骂我了，只要清清净净的饿两顿就好了。不必吃煎药，我送点丸药来，临睡用姜汤研开吃下去就好了。”说毕，告辞而去。贾珍等拿了药方来回明贾母原故，将药方放在案上出去，不在话下。\n　　这里王夫人和李纨、凤姐儿、宝钗姐妹等，见大夫出去，方从厨后出来。王夫人略坐一坐，也回房去了。刘老老见无事，方上来和贾母告辞。贾母说：“闲了再来。”又命鸳鸯来：“好生打发刘老老出去。我身上不好，不能送你。”刘老老道了谢，又作辞，方同鸳鸯出来。到了下房，鸳鸯指炕上一个包袱说道：“这是老太太的几件衣裳，都是往年间生日节下众人孝敬的。老太太从不穿人家做的，收着也可惜，却是一次也没穿过的，昨日叫我拿出两套来送你带了去，或送人，或自己家里穿罢。这盒子里头是你要的面果子。这包儿里头是你前儿说的药，梅花点舌丹也有，紫金锭也有，活络丹也有，催生保命丹也有，每一样是一张方子包着，总包在里头了。这是两个荷包，带着玩罢。”说着，又抽开系子，掏出两个“笔锭如意”的锞子来给他瞧，又笑道：“荷包你拿去，这个留下给我罢。”刘老老已喜出望外，早又念了几千佛，听鸳鸯如此说，便忙说道：“姑娘只管留下罢。”鸳鸯见他信以为真，笑着仍给他装上，说道：“哄你玩呢，我有好些呢。留着年下给小孩子们罢。”说着，只见一个小丫头拿着个成窑钟子来，递给刘老老，说：“这是宝二爷给你的。”刘老老道：“这是那里说起？我那一世修来的，今儿这样。”说着便接过来。鸳鸯道：“前儿我叫你洗澡，换的衣裳是我的，你不弃嫌，我还有几件也送你罢。”刘老老又忙道谢。鸳鸯果然又拿出几件来，给他包好。刘老老又要到园中辞谢宝玉和众妹妹王夫人等去，鸳鸯道：“不用去了。他们这会子也不见人，回来我替你说罢。闲了再来。”又命了一个老婆子，吩咐他：“二门上叫两个小厮来，帮着老老拿了东西送去。”婆子答应了，又和刘老老到了凤姐儿那边，一并拿了东西，在角门上命小厮们搬出去，直送刘老老上车去了，不在话下。\n　　且说宝钗等吃过早饭，又往贾母处问安，回园至分路之处，宝钗便叫黛玉道：“颦儿跟我来，有一句话问你。”黛玉便笑着跟了来。至蘅芜院中，进了房，宝钗便坐下，笑道：“你还不给我跪下！我要审你呢。”黛玉不解何故，因笑道：“你瞧宝丫头疯了！审我什么？”宝钗冷笑道：“好个千金小姐，好个不出屋门的女孩儿！满嘴里说的是什么？你只实说罢。”黛玉不解，只管发笑，心里也不免疑惑，口里只说：“我何曾说什么？你不过要捏我的错儿罢咧。你倒说出来我听听。”宝钗笑道：“你还装憨儿呢！昨儿行酒令儿，你说的是什么？我竟不知是那里来的。”黛玉一想，方想起昨儿失于检点，那《牡丹亭》、《西厢记》说了两句，不觉红了脸，便上来搂着宝钗笑道：“好姐姐，原是我不知道，随口说的。你教给我，再不说了。”宝钗笑道：“我也不知道，听你说的怪好的，所以请教你。”黛玉道：“好姐姐！你别说给别人，我再不说了！”宝钗见他羞的满脸飞红，满口央告，便不肯再往下问。\n因拉他坐下吃茶，款款的告诉他道：“你当我是谁？我也是个淘气的，从小儿七八岁上，也够个人缠的。我们家也算是个读书人家，祖父手里也极爱藏书。先时人口多，姐妹弟兄也在一处，都怕看正经书。弟兄们也有爱诗的，也有爱词的，诸如这些《西厢》、《琵琶》以及《元人百种》，无所不有。他们背着我们偷看，我们也背着他们偷看。后来大人知道了，打的打，骂的骂，烧的烧，丢开了。所以咱们女孩儿家不认字的倒好。男人们读书不明理，尚且不如不读书的好，何况你我？连做诗写字等事，这也不是你我分内之事，究竟也不是男人分内之事。男人们读书明理，辅国治民，这才是好。只是如今并听不见有这样的人，读了书，倒更坏了。这并不是书误了他，可惜他把书糟塌了，所以竟不如耕种买卖，倒没有什么大害处。至于你我，只该做些针线纺绩的事才是。偏又认得几个字。既认得了字，不过拣那正经书看也罢了，最怕见些杂书，移了性情，就不可救了。”一席话，说的黛玉垂头吃茶，心下暗服，只有答应“是”的一字。\n　　忽见素云进来说：“我们奶奶请二位姑娘商议要紧的事呢。二姑娘、三姑娘、四姑娘、史姑娘、宝二爷，都等着呢。”宝钗说：“又是什么事？”黛玉道：“咱们到了那里就知道了。”说着，便和宝钗往稻香村来，果见众人都在那里。李纨见了他两个，笑道：“社还没起，就有脱滑儿的了，四丫头要告一年的假呢。”黛玉笑道：“都是老太太昨儿一句话，又叫他画什么园子图儿，惹的他乐得告假了。”探春笑道：“也别怪老太太，都是刘老老一句话。”黛玉忙笑接道：“可是呢，都是他一句话。他是那一门子的老老？直叫他是个‘母蝗虫’就是了。”说着，大家都笑起来。宝钗笑道：“世上的话，到了二嫂子嘴里也就尽了，幸而二嫂子不认得字，不大通，不过一概是市俗取笑儿。更有颦儿这促狭嘴，他用《春秋》的法子，把市俗粗话撮其要，删其繁，再加润色，比方出来，一句是一句。这‘母蝗虫’三字，把昨儿那些形景都画出来了。亏他想的倒也快！”众人听了，都笑道：“你这一注解，也就不在他两个以下了。”\n　　李纨道：“我请你们大家商议，给他多少日子的假？我给了他一个月的假，他嫌少，你们怎么说？”黛玉道：“论理，一年也不多，这园子盖就盖了一年，如今要画，自然得二年的工夫呢。又要研墨，又要蘸笔，又要铺纸，又要着颜色，又要……”刚说到这里，黛玉也自己掌不住，笑道：“又要照着样儿慢慢的画，可不得二年的工夫？”众人听了，都拍手笑个不住。宝钗笑道：“有趣，最妙落后一句是‘慢慢的画’。他可不画去，怎么就有了呢，所以昨儿那些笑活儿虽然可笑，回想是没趣的。你们细想，颦儿这几句话，虽没什么，回想却有滋味。我倒笑的动不得了。”惜春道：“都是宝姐姐赞的他越发逞强，这会子又拿我取笑儿。”黛玉忙拉他笑道：“我且问你，还是单画这园子呢，还是连我们众人都画在上头呢？”惜春道：“原是只画这园子。昨儿老太太又说：‘单画园子，成了房样子了。’叫连人都画上，就象行乐图儿才好。我又不会这工细楼台，又不会画人物，又不好驳回，正为这个为难呢。”黛玉道：“人物还容易，你草虫儿上不能？”李纨道：“你又说不通的话了。这上头那里又用草虫儿呢？或者瓴毛倒要点缀一两样。”黛玉笑道：“别的草虫儿罢了，昨儿的‘母蝗虫’不画上，岂不缺了典呢？“众人听了，都笑起来。黛玉一面笑的两只手捧着胸口，一面说道：“你快画罢，我连题跋都有了。起了名字，就叫做《携蝗大嚼图》。”众人听了，越发哄然大笑的前仰后合。只听咕咚一声响，不知什么倒了，急忙看时，原来是湘云伏在椅子背儿上，那椅子原不曾放稳，被他全身伏着背子大笑，他又不防，两下里错了笋，向东一歪，连人带椅子都歪倒了。幸有板壁挡住，不曾落地。众人，一见，越发笑个不住。宝玉忙赴上去扶住了，起来，方渐渐止了笑。\n　　宝玉和黛玉使个眼色儿，黛玉会意，便走至里间，将镜袱揭起。照了照，只见两鬓略松了些，忙开了李纨的妆奁，拿出抿子来，对镜抿了两抿，仍旧收拾好了，方出来指着李纨道：“这是叫你带着我们做针钱、教道理呢，你反招了我们来大玩大笑的！”李纨笑道：“你们听他这刁话，他领着头儿闹，引着人笑了，倒赖我的不是！真真恨的我……只保佑你明儿得一个利害婆婆，再得几个千刁万恶的大姑子、小姑子，试试你那会子还这么刁不刁了！”\n　　黛玉早红了脸，拉着宝钗说：“咱们放他一年的假罢。”宝钗道：“我有一句公道话，你们听听。藕丫头虽会画，不过是几笔写意。如今画这园子，非离了肚子里头有些丘壑的，如何成画？这园子却是象画儿一般，山石树木，楼阁房屋，远近疏密，也不多，也不少，恰恰的是这样。你若照样儿往纸上一画，是必不能讨好的。这要看纸的地步远近，该多该少，分主分宾，该添的要添，该藏该减的要藏要减，该露的要露，这一起了稿子，再端详斟酌，方成一幅图样。第二件，这些楼台房舍，是必要界划的。一点儿不留神，栏杆也歪了，柱子也塌了，门窗也倒竖过来，阶砌也离了缝，甚至桌子挤到墙里头去，花盆放在帘子上来，岂不倒成了一张笑话儿了。第三，要安插人物，也要有疏密，高低，衣摺裙带，指手足步，最是要紧，一笔不细，不是肿了手，就是瘸了脚，染脸撕发倒是小事。依我看来，竟难的很。如今一年的假也太多，一月的假也太少，竟给他半年的假；再派了宝兄弟帮着他。并不是为宝兄弟知道教着他画，那就更误了事。为的是有不知道的，或难安插的，宝兄弟拿出去问问那会画的先生们，就容易了。”宝玉听了，先喜的说：“这话极是，詹子亮的工细楼台就极好，程日兴的美人是绝技，如今就问他们去。”\n　　宝钗道：“我说你是‘无事忙’，说了一声，你就问他去，也等着商议定了再去。如今且说拿什么画？”宝玉道：“家里有雪浪纸，又大，又托墨。”宝钗冷笑道：“我说你不中用，那雪浪纸写字、画写意画儿，或是会山水的画南宗山水，托墨，禁得皴染。拿了画这个，又不托色，又难烘，画也不好，纸也可惜。我教给你一个法子，原先盖这园子就有一张细致图样，虽是画工描的，那地步方向是不错的。你和太太要出来，也比着那纸的大小，和凤姐姐要一块重绢，交给外边相公们，叫他照着这图样删补着立了稿子，添了人物，就是了。就是配这些青绿颜色，并泥金泥银，也得他们配去。你们也得另拢上风炉子，预备化胶、出胶、洗笔。还得一个粉油大案，铺上毡子。你们那些碟子也不全，笔也不全，都从新再弄一分儿才好。”惜春道：“我何曾有这些画器？不过随手的笔画画罢了。就是颜色，只有赭石、广花、藤黄、胭脂这四样。再有不过是两支着色的笔就完了。”宝钗道：“你何不早说？这些东西我却还有，只是你用不着，给你也白放着。如今我且替你收着，等你用着这个的时候我送你些。也只可留着画扇子，若画这大幅的，也就可惜了。今儿替你开个单子，照着单子和老太太要去。你们也未必知道的全，我说着，宝兄弟写。”\n　　宝玉早已预备下笔砚了，原怕记不清白，要写了记着，听宝钗如此说，喜的提起笔来静听。宝钗说道：“头号排笔四支，二号排笔四支，三号排笔四支，大染四支，中染四支，小染四支，大南蟹爪十支，小蟹爪十支，须眉十支，大着色二十支，小着色二十支，开面十支，柳条二十支，箭头朱四两，南赭四两，石黄四两，石青四两，石绿四两，管黄四两，广花八两，铅粉十四匣，胭脂十二帖，大赤二百帖，青金二百帖，广匀胶四两，净矾四两。矾绢的胶矾在外，别管他们，只把绢交出去，叫他们矾去。这些颜色，咱们淘澄飞跌着，又玩了，又使了，包你一辈子都够使了。再要顶细绢箩四个，粗箩二个，担笔四支，大小乳钵四个，大粗碗二十个，五寸碟子十个，三寸粗白碟子二十个，风炉两个，沙锅大小四个，新磁缸二口，新水桶二只，一尺长白布口袋四个，浮炭二十斤，柳木炭一二斤，三屉木箱一个，实地纱一丈，生姜二两，酱半斤。”黛玉忙笑道：“铁锅一口，铁铲一个。”宝钗道：“这做什么？”黛玉道：“你要生姜和酱这些作料，我替你要铁锅来，好炒颜色吃啊。”众人都笑起来。宝钗笑道：“颦儿你知道什么，那粗磁碟子保不住不上火烤，不拿姜汁子和酱预先在抹底子上烤过，一经了火，是要炸的。”众人听说，都道：“这就是了。”\n　　黛玉又看了一回单子，笑着拉探春悄悄的道：“你瞧瞧，画个画儿，又要起这些水缸箱子来。想必糊涂了，把他的嫁妆单子也写上了。”探春听了，笑个不住，说道：“宝姐姐，你还不拧他的嘴？你问问他编派你的话。”宝钗笑道：“不用问，‘狗嘴里还有象牙不成’！”一面说，一面走上来，把黛玉按在炕上，便要拧他的脸。黛玉笑着，忙央告道：“好姐姐，饶了我罢！颦儿年纪小，只知说，不知道轻重，做姐姐的教导我。姐姐不饶我，我还求谁去呢。”众人不知话内有因，都笑道：“说的好可怜见儿的，连我们也软了，饶了他罢。”宝钗原是和他玩，忽听他又拉扯上前番说他胡看杂书的话，便不好再和他闹了，放起他来。黛玉笑道：“到底是姐姐，要是我，再不饶人的。”宝钗笑指他道：“怪不得老太太疼你，众人爱你，今儿我也怪疼你的了。过来，我替你把头发笼笼罢。”黛玉果然转过身来，宝钗用手笼上去。宝玉在旁看着，只觉更好，不觉后悔：“不该令他抿上鬓去，也该留着，此时叫他替他抿上去。”正自胡想，只见宝钗说道：“写完了，明儿回老太太去。若家里有的就罢，若没有的，就拿些钱去买了来，我帮着你们配。”宝玉忙收了单子。\n大家又说了一回闲话儿。至晚饭后，又往贾母处来请安。贾母原没有大病，不过是劳乏了，兼着了些凉，温存了一日，又吃了一两剂药，发散了发散，至晚也就好了。\n不知次日又有何话，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang had left, the girls went back to the Garden for a meal. Granny Liu took Baner first to see Xifeng.\n\n“I must go home first thing tomorrow,” she said. “I’ve only been here a couple of days but I’ve seen and eaten things I never even heard of in all my born days. I’m most grateful to the old lady and you, madam, and the young ladies too, as well as all the other ladies in the different apartments, for being so kind to a poor old woman like me. I’ve no way to show my thanks, but I shall burn incense and pray for you every day, asking Buddha to grant you all long life. That’s the best I can do.”\n\n“Don’t be too pleased with yourself,” said Xifeng. “It was all on your account that the old lady caught a chill in the wind and is lying down now, feeling poorly; and our little girl has caught cold too and is running a fever.”\n\nGranny Liu clicked her tongue in sympathy. “The old lady’s advanced in years and can’t stand much fatigue.”\n\n“She’s never enjoyed herself so much as she did yesterday,” said Xifeng. “When she usually goes to the Garden she just sits in one or two places for a little and then comes back. But because you were here yesterday she wanted to show you everything, and she walked over half the Garden. I had to go off to find you, and while my back was turned the child was given a piece of cake by Her Ladyship. She must have eaten it in the wind, and now she’s feverish.”\n\n“My little granddaughter doesn’t go into the Garden much, I fancy. She’s not like our children who play in any graveyard and run all over the place. She may have been chilled by the wind, or else, being a clean-looking child with clear eyes, she may have seen some spirit. Why not look up the book of charms to see if she has run into some evil influence?”\n\nThis reminded Xifeng to tell Pinger to fetch the Yuxiaji and have Caiming read it out. After turning a few pages he announced:\n\n“On the twenty-fifth of the eighth month, sickness may be caused in the southeast by the spirit of a young woman who met a violent death. The cure is to use forty sheets of five-colour paper money and walk forty paces southeast to offer them, then all will be well.”\n\n“That fits,” cried Xifeng. “There are flower spirits in the Garden. Perhaps the old lady met one too.” She ordered two lots of paper money to be prepared, and two serving-women were sent to make the offering — one for the Lady Dowager, one for the child. And sure enough, after that the little girl fell quietly asleep.\n\n“You elderly people have more experience,” said Xifeng. “I often wonder why our child is so sickly.”\n\n“That’s quite common,” replied Granny Liu. “Children from rich families are too delicate to stand any rough treatment. And if you spoil them they can’t take that either. If you care for her less, madam, she may do better.”\n\n“That makes sense,” agreed Xifeng. “Come to think of it, she hasn’t got a name yet. Will you choose one for her? That may help, as you’ve lived so long. And you country folk aren’t so soft — no offence meant — but you’re poorer, and a name given by poor folk may make her easier to rear.”\n\nAfter thinking this over Granny Liu asked, “When was she born?”\n\n“That’s the trouble — her birthday’s unlucky. It was on the seventh of the seventh moon.”\n\n“Then call her Qiaojie. This is what’s known as ‘fighting poison with poison and fire with fire.’ If you agree to this name, madam, I guarantee she’ll live to a great age. Later on, when she grows up and has her own family, if anything goes against her wish everything will turn out well and any bad luck will be averted — all on account of this name ‘Qiao’ (fortuitous).”\n\nXifeng, naturally pleased, thanked her saying, “I only hope it turns out as you predict.” She told Pinger, “We may not be able to see to our business tomorrow.\n\nXian’er, since you’re free now, get Granny’s presents ready so that she can be off first thing tomorrow,” she said.\n\n“You shouldn’t go to such expense,” protested Granny Liu. “I’ve put you to enough trouble already, staying several days; and now I’m to take presents away too. I really don’t know how to thank you.”\n\n“Nothing much,” said Xifeng. “Just ordinary things. But good or bad, they’ll show the neighbours and make a bit of a splash — prove that you’ve been to town.”\n\nAs she was speaking, Pinger came in.\n\n“Will you step this way, granny, and have a look?” she asked.\n\nGranny Liu followed her to the other room, where half the kang was piled with things. Pinger pointed them out one by one.\n\n“This is the bolt of black gauze you asked for yesterday. Her Ladyship is giving you as well another length of moon-white chiffon for a lining. These two lengths of pongee are for jackets and skirts. In this bundle are two lengths of silk for you to make some clothes with at New Year. This box contains all sorts of cakes made in the Palace — some you’ve tasted, some not. They’re better than any you can buy to offer your guests. These two sacks you brought for fruit: one is filled with two pecks of special rice from the Imperial farms, which makes extra good congee; the other with fruit from the garden and different kinds of dried fruits. This packet contains eight taels of silver. All this is from Her Ladyship. These two packets of fifty taels each, making a hundred, are from the mistress. She wants you to start a small business or buy some land, so that in future you won’t have to beg help from relatives or friends.”\n\nShe added in a lower voice with a smile, “These two jackets and two skirts, the four head-scarves and the bundle of wool are my present to you, granny. The clothes haven’t been worn much, but if you think them too shabby to accept, of course I shan’t be offended.”\n\nAs Pinger enumerated each item the old woman invoked the name of Buddha several thousand times. And now that Pinger gave her presents too, so modestly, she protested with a smile:\n\n“How can you talk like that, miss? Why, such fine things aren’t to be bought for money. I’d be ashamed to accept them, but it would look so churlish to refuse that I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“Don’t talk that way. We’re all one family — that’s why I’ve made so bold. Just take them, and don’t worry. I shall be asking you for something later on. At New Year, do send us some of your dried vegetables — those ash-weed strings, cowpeas, French beans, dried eggplants and calabash strips. We’d all like to taste them. Don’t bother with anything else, though; that would be too much.”\n\nGranny Liu effusively promised to do this.\n\n“You just go to bed now,” said Pinger. “I’ll pack everything up for you and leave it ready here. First thing tomorrow I’ll get some boys to call a cab and load it up for you. You won’t have to worry about a thing.”\n\nMore grateful than ever, the old woman thanked Xifeng again and again before going to spend the night in the Lady Dowager’s apartments. The next day she washed and dressed and would have taken her leave first thing, but as the old lady was unwell the whole family came to ask after her health and sent to ask the doctor to call.\n\nPresently a servant announced, “The doctor is here,” and an old nurse asked the Lady Dowager to go behind the curtains.\n\n“I’m old enough to have one foot in the grave,” she retorted. “What should I be afraid of, that I must hide from a doctor? Let him come in. There’s no need for any curtains.”\n\nThe servants then set a small table on the kang, put a small pillow on it, and sent to invite the doctor in. They saw Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Jia Rong usher in a doctor, who walked not along the central paved path but by the steps at the side, keeping his head lowered as he followed Jia Zhen to the hall. Two maids raised the portiere and two old nurses let him into the Lady Dowager’s room.\n\nAs she entered, Baoyu came out to greet her. She saw the Lady Dowager wearing a grey silk gown with a lamb’s-wool lining, sitting upright on her couch. On either side stood four little maids with their hair not yet dressed, holding fly-whisks and rinsing-bowls; and five or six old nurses were ranged on both sides. Behind the green gauze screen she could vaguely discern a number of figures gaily dressed and bejewelled, but Dr. Wang did not venture to look up. He stepped forward promptly to pay his respects.\n\nSeeing from his sixth-rank costume that he was a court physician, the Lady Dowager asked with a smile, “Are you an honorary court physician, sir?” She turned to Jia Zhen to ask, “What is this gentleman’s honourable name?”\n\n“Dr. Wang,” was the answer.\n\n“Some time ago there was a Dr. Wang Junxiao in the Imperial Medical Service,” said the old lady. “He was a very good pulse-reader.”\n\nDr. Wang bowed and smiled.\n\n“He was my uncle,” he said.\n\n“So we are old family friends,” she rejoined, slowly stretching out her arm on to the small pillow.\n\nA nurse placed a small stool by the small table, slightly to one side, and the doctor sat down with one leg crossed over the other. Leaning forward he felt her pulse for some time, then did the same with the other arm.\n\nHaving finished he rose and bowed, then withdrew.\n\n“Thank you for your trouble,” said the Lady Dowager. “Zhen, see him out and give him some tea.”\n\nJia Zhen and Jia Lian assented and escorted Dr. Wang to the outer study.\n\n“The old lady has nothing wrong with her apart from a slight chill,” he told them. “There is really no need to take any medicine. A light diet and keeping warm will set her right. However, I will write out a prescription, and if she fancies the medicine you can decoct a dose for her. If not, just forget it.”\n\nHe drank some tea then and wrote out the prescription. As he was taking his leave, the nurse appeared with the little girl.\n\n“Do take a look at her, sir,” she said.\n\nAt once the doctor stepped forward and, while the nurse held the child, took her left hand to feel her pulse. He felt her head too and told her to put out her tongue.\n\n“I shall get scolded by this young lady for what I have to say,” he remarked with a smile. “All she needs is a couple of days on plain vegetarian fare. No need to decoct any medicine. I shall send some pills; if you take them at bedtime with ginger decoction, that will set you right.”\n\nWith that he took his leave. Jia Zhen and the others saw him out, then reported back to the Lady Dowager and put the prescription away — but no more of this.\n\nAfter the doctor’s departure, Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xifeng, Baochai and the other girls came out from behind the screen. Lady Wang sat there for a while, then went back to her own apartments. And when Granny Liu saw that nothing was happening, she came forward to take her leave of the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Do come again when you have time,” said the old lady. “Yuanyang, see that Granny Liu has a good meal before she goes. I’m not feeling up to escorting her out.”\n\nGranny Liu thanked her effusively and said goodbye, then went off with Yuanyang to her room. Pointing to a bundle on the kang, Yuanyang told her:\n\n“These are some clothes the old lady’s been given on her birthdays and at festivals, presents from different people. She never wears anything made outside, so it’s a pity to keep these stored away. They’ve never been worn, though. Yesterday she told me to pick out two suits for you to take back. You can give them away or keep them for yourself. This box contains the cakes you asked for. And this packet has the medicines you mentioned the other day: Plum Blossom Tongue-Coating Pills, Purple Gold Pills, Activator of the Veins Pills, as well as Life-Savers for Women in Labour. Each kind is wrapped up with its prescription, and they’re all in this big package. Here are two purses for you to play with.”\n\nWith that she untied her purse and took out two ingots shaped like “pen and sceptre” — symbols of literary talent and good fortune — to show the old woman.\n\n“Take the purses,” she said jokingly, “but leave these for me.”\n\nGranny Liu, beside herself with joy, had already invoked the name of Buddha thousands of times. Now she cheerfully agreed.\n\n“Do keep them,” she begged.\n\nYuanyang laughingly stuffed the things back into the bundle, explaining, “I was only teasing. I’ve plenty more. Keep these for the children at New Year.”\n\nJust then a young maid brought in a Cheng Hua porcelain cup and gave it to Granny Liu, saying, “This is from Master Bao.”\n\n“How ever did I deserve such kindness?” exclaimed the old woman. “I must have done good deeds in a former life.” She took the cup.\n\nYuanyang told her, “The clothes I changed you into the other day after your bath were mine. If you don’t think them beneath you, I’ve several more I’d like to give you.”\n\nGranny Liu thanked her profusely.\n\nYuanyang produced some more clothes and wrapped them up for her. When the old woman wanted to go to the Garden to thank Baoyu, the young ladies and Lady Wang, Yuanyang dissuaded her.\n\n“There’s no need,” she said. “They’re not receiving visitors just now. I’ll give them your message. Do come again when you’ve time.” She ordered an old servant-woman, “Tell the pages at the inner gate to send two boys to help Granny Liu with her things.”\n\nThe woman assented and accompanied Granny Liu to Xifeng’s quarters to collect the other parcels. Then she had the boys at the side gate carry all the things out and put them in Granny Liu’s cart. But no more of this.\n\nAfter breakfast Baochai and the others went to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager. Then, as they strolled back to the Garden, Baochai called to Daiyu, “Come with me, Frowner. I’ve something to ask you.”\n\nDaiyu followed with a smile to Alpinia Park. Once in her room, Baochai sat down and said:\n\n“Come, kneel down! I’m going to cross-question you.”\n\nDaiyu, not knowing what she meant, giggled.\n\n“What’s come over you, Baochai? What do you want to cross-question me about?”\n\n“Don’t play the innocent,” retorted Baochai coldly. “A fine young lady you are! The things you came out with yesterday! Out with the truth now.”\n\nStill at a loss but sensing something amiss, Daiyu simply giggled.\n\n“What did I say?” she asked. “You’re just trying to put me in the wrong. Tell me what you mean.”\n\n“And you still pretend ignorance. What were those lines you quoted during the drinking game yesterday? I’d like to know where they come from.”\n\nDaiyu then remembered her slips of the day before. She had cited two lines from The Peony Pavilion and The Western Chamber. Blushing, she threw her arms around Baochai.\n\n“Dear cousin, I didn’t realize and said that without thinking. Do please tell me, and I promise not to repeat it.”\n\n“I don’t know either,” teased Baochai. “Your lines sounded so charming, I came to ask you to tell me the meaning.”\n\n“Dear cousin, don’t tell anyone! I promise not to do it again.”\n\nSeeing her so embarrassed, all flushed and imploring, Baochai had not the heart to pursue the matter. She made Daiyu sit down and have some tea, then quietly explained:\n\n“Don’t take me for a prig. I was just as mischievous as you as a child. At seven or eight I was enough to try anyone to the limit. Our family, after all, was a scholarly one. My grandfather’s chief delight was collecting books. He had a big family then, with all the boys and girls together, and none of us children liked serious reading. The boys might play at writing poems or songs, and we had all the operas and romances like The Western Chamber, The Lute, and A Hundred Yuan Plays. They used to read them behind our backs, and we did the same behind theirs. Later, when the grownups found out, there were beatings, cursing, burnings and forced sales — any number of penalties to stop us. So we girls are better off illiterate. If men who study fail to understand the truth, it would be better for them not to study either; and that goes even more for us. As for writing poetry and other elegant pastimes, that’s not required of us — nor of men either. Men who have studied should display their loyalty and goodness and do their best to serve the state and rule the people.\n\nThat’s true. But we don’t see people like that nowadays. Studying seems to make some people worse. That’s not the fault of the books though. They’re misusing them and turning them to bad account; so they’d do better to farm or trade instead of studying, as that would do less harm. As for us, we should just do needlework and spin. What a pity we’ve learned to read! If we must, we should read solid books, not frivolous works which could corrupt us. Once your nature is warped, there’s no remedy for it.”\n\nDaiyu, drinking tea, lowered her head in silent approval of this advice, simply assenting.\n\nJust then Suyun came in to announce, “Our mistress wants you two young ladies to go and discuss something important. The other young ladies and Master Bao are all there waiting.”\n\n“What is it this time?” asked Baochai.\n\n“We’ll know when we get there,” said Daiyu.\n\nSo they went to Paddy-Sweet Cottage and found everyone assembled.\n\n“The club’s not yet started, but here are two deserters already,” said Li Wan at sight of them. “And now Xichun wants a whole year’s leave.”\n\n“It’s the old lady’s fault,” Daiyu chuckled. “She told her to paint a picture of the Garden, and Xichun’s so pleased she’s asking for leave.”\n\n“Don’t blame the old lady,” put in Tanchun. “It was Granny Liu’s idea.”\n\n“Of course!” cried Daiyu. “It was her doing. What relation is she of ours, anyway? Why not just call her ‘the old locust’?”\n\nThis set everyone laughing.\n\n“Our Xifeng has the glibbest tongue under Heaven,” said Baochai. “But luckily she’s uneducated and not too well informed, so all her jokes are rather vulgar. Our Daiyu’s tongue is even sharper. She uses the method of the Spring and Autumn Annals to condense the vulgar talk of the market-place, leaving out the superfluous and retaining the essence, then polishes it to produce allusions which hit the nail on the head. ‘The old locust’ just sums up the whole business yesterday. How quick-witted she is!”\n\nThe rest laughed and cried, “Yes, your commentary’s as good as their jokes.”\n\n“I asked you here to decide how long we should let her have,” said Li Wan. “I said a month, but she thinks that’s too little. What do you say?”\n\n“In my opinion, a year’s not too long,” replied Daiyu. “It took a year to build this Garden. Now she has to paint it. That means grinding ink, dipping the brush, laying out the paper and mixing the colours....”\n\nShe broke off then herself to laugh.\n\n“She’ll have to do it slowly, carefully, so of course it’ll take two years.”\n\nAt this the others clapped their hands, laughing.\n\n“That’s good!” cried Baochai. “The best part is that ‘slowly, carefully.’ If she doesn’t take her time how can she do it? So although yesterday’s jokes were funny, thinking them over now they seem pointless. But though there’s nothing to Daiyu’s remarks, when you think them over they’re very witty. I’m still laughing.”\n\n“It’s because you praised her, cousin, that she’s showing off again and making fun of me,” said Xichun.\n\nDaiyu caught her by the hand.\n\n“Tell me, are you just going to paint the Garden, or will you put us all in it too?” she asked.\n\n“At first I just meant to do the Garden,” answered Xichun. “But the old lady said yesterday that wouldn’t be any good — it would look like an architect’s drawing. She wants me to put all you people in as well, like a picture of a pleasure party. I’m no good at detailed architecture or at painting figures either, and I can’t very well refuse. This is such a problem to me.”\n\n“Figures aren’t hard,” retorted Daiyu. “What about insects on the grass?”\n\n“If you can’t do that....”\n\n\"You do talk nonsense. What would be the use of grasshoppers or locusts here? A few feathers might not be amiss, though.\"\n\n\"Other insects may be all right,\" chuckled Tai-yu, \"but if you leave out yesterday's 'mother locust' the whole thing will fall flat.\"\n\nThe others laughed again at that.\n\nTai-yu, her hands pressed to her breast, went on, \"Hurry up and paint it. I've even thought of an inscription: 'A Picture of Gorging on a Locust.'\"\n\nThis set the whole party laughing so wildly that Hsiang-yun, who was leaning back against her chair, toppled over. As the chair was not properly placed, it slipped and she fell to the ground. Luckily the partition behind stopped it from going right over, so that she did not land on the floor. The others, of course, were convulsed with laughter. Pao-yu hastily rushed forward to help her up, and gradually their mirth subsided.\n\nPao-yu then winked at Tai-yu, who took the hint and went into the inner room. Lifting the mirror-cover, she saw that her hair was slightly dishevelled. She opened Li Wan's dressing-case, took out a small brush and smoothed her hair before the mirror, then put everything away again. Coming out, she pointed at Li Wan.\n\n\"You were supposed to be teaching us sewing and deportment, yet here you're making us laugh and fool about like this!\" she cried.\n\nLi Wan smiled.\n\n\"Listen to her, so sharp-tongued! She leads the others in fooling about and making people laugh, then she puts the blame on me. It's really too bad.... I just hope you have a fierce mother-in-law and several malicious sisters-in-law, that'll take the cheek out of you!\"\n\nTai-yu had flushed and was tugging at Pao-chai.\n\n\"Let's give her a year's leave,\" she proposed.\n\n\"I'll be fair,\" said Pao-chai. \"Listen to me. Although Ou-kuan can paint, she's only good at impressionistic sketches. To paint this garden, you need to conceive the whole design in your mind first. The Garden's like a painting, with mountains, trees, pavilions and houses — not too many, not too few, just in the right proportions. If you simply copy it as it is, it won't look attractive. You must consider the dimensions of the paper and the relative distance of objects, deciding what's to be prominent and what secondary, what to show and what to omit, what to add and what to cut. After careful deliberation you can make a rough draft first, then work out the details to produce a good composition. Secondly, you'll have to draw the buildings with a ruler, taking great care over the railings, pillars, windows and lattices, the steps and the seams, or they'll look crooked and out of place; and if tables are squeezed into walls or flower-pots hung from curtains, it will be a joke. Thirdly, in inserting figures you must space them well, making some big, some small, some squatting, some sitting, some talking, some gesturing. Their costumes and girdles, fingers and feet are most important. One careless stroke and the hands may look swollen or the feet crippled. That would be even worse than smudging their faces or tousling their hair. To my thinking, this is most difficult. A year is too long, a month too short. Let's give her half a year's leave and ask Cousin Pao to help her. Not to teach her how to paint, that would only make matters worse. But if he finds anything she doesn't understand or can't manage, he can ask those painters outside for her and so make things easier.\"\n\nPao-yu was delighted with this suggestion.\n\n\"Quite right,\" he cried. \" Chin Jun-ming is good at painting pavilions and Cheng Jih-hsing at beauties. I'll go and ask them.\"\n\n\"You're 'busy over nothing' again!\" scolded Pao-chai. \"Hear me out first.\n\n\"Wait till we've decided what you need and then you can go. Now, what paper are you going to use?\"\n\n\"We have Hsueh-lang paper at home,\" said Pao-yu. \"It's big and absorbs ink well.\"\n\n\"I knew you were useless,\" scoffed Pao-chai. \"That Hsueh-lang paper is for writing on, or for painting impressionistic landscapes in the Southern style; its absorbency makes it good for washes. But it doesn't take colour well and is difficult to manage. If you use it, your picture won't be good and the paper will be wasted. Now let me tell you what to do. After the design for this Garden was approved, a detailed drawing was made by the artisans. Though it's only a workman's drawing, the layout and perspective are correct. You should ask the mistress for it, then get a piece of close-woven, heavy silk from Hsi-feng the size of the drawing, and get some outside painters to make a clean copy on the silk, with the necessary additions and omissions. They can put in the figures too. And they must mix the blue and green colours as well as the gold and silver for you. You'll need a portable stove to melt the size and clarify it, and to rinse your brushes. Also a large oiled board and a felt. Your saucers and brushes aren't adequate either; you'll have to get a new lot.\"\n\n\"I've no proper equipment for painting,\" put in Hsi-chun. \"I just use my ordinary writing-brushes. As for colours, all I have is ochre, indigo, gamboge and rouge. And two brushes for applying colour — that's all.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you say so before?\" asked Pao-chai. \"I've got all these things, only you've no use for them, so it would be a pity to give them to you. I'll keep them for you now and let you have what you need later. Of course, they're only fit for painting fans; it would be a shame to use them for a big picture like this. I'll make out a list today, and you can ask the old lady for the things. I doubt if you know all that's needed, so I'll dictate and Pao-yu can write it down.\"\n\nPao-yu, who had already got out his writing-brush and inkstone for fear of forgetting something, was only too glad to do this. He took up his brush and listened attentively.\n\nPao-chai began: \"Four large brushes for applying colour, four of the second size, four of the third size. Four large 'dyeing' brushes, four medium, four small. Ten large 'crab's claw' brushes, ten small, ten for drawing lines. Twenty large colouring brushes, twenty small. Ten brushes for drawing features. Twenty willow-leaf brushes. Four ounces of vermilion, four of southern red ochre, four of orpiment, four of azurite, four of malachite, four of gamboge in tubes. Eight ounces of indigo. Fourteen boxes of lead powder. Twelve packets of rouge. Two hundred sheets of red gold foil. Two hundred sheets of pure gold foil. Four ounces of glue, and four of pure alum.\n\n\"As for the size and alum for treating the silk, don't worry about them. Just give the silk to the men to treat. We can sift and wash the colours ourselves — it's fun and we'll be using them too. I guarantee you'll have enough to last you a lifetime. Then you'll need four fine sieves for the colours, two coarse ones. Four dusting brushes. Four large mortars and pestles, and twenty big coarse bowls. Ten five-inch saucers, twenty three-inch white porcelain saucers. Two portable stoves. Four earthenware pots, big and small. Two new porcelain vats. Two new buckets. Four long white cloth sacks. Twenty catties of soft charcoal. Ten catties of charcoal made of willow wood. One chest with three drawers. One chang of real silk gauze. Two ounces of ginger. Half a catty of soy sauce.\"\n\nTai-yu put in laughingly, \"And an iron frying-pan and an iron spatula.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Pao-chai.\n\n\"You need ginger and soy as ingredients, so I thought you'd need a frying-pan to fry your colours in,\" quipped Tai-yu.\n\nThe others laughed.\n\n\"Don't be so silly, Pin-erh,\" said Pao-chai. \"You don't understand. These coarse porcelain saucers have to be heated over the fire. Unless they're rubbed on the bottom beforehand with ginger and soy, they may crack.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" cried the rest.\n\nPao-yu looked at the list again and, taking Tan-chun aside, whispered with a smile:\n\n“Just look! To paint a picture she needs all these vats and boxes. She must have got confused and put down her dowry list too.”\n\nThis made Tan-chun double up with mirth.\n\n“Cousin Pao-chai,” she cried, “why don’t you pinch her lips? Ask her what she means by making up such things about you.”\n\n“No need to ask,” retorted Pao-chai. “What can you expect from a dog but a bark?” She moved forward as she spoke to press Tai-yu down on the kang and pinch her cheeks.\n\nTai-yu laughingly pleaded for mercy. “Dear cousin, do let me off! I’m young and foolish and don’t know any better, but you should teach me. If you won’t forgive me, who can I turn to?”\n\nThe others, not knowing what lay behind this, commented with a smile, “How pathetic she is! Even we feel sorry for her. Do let her off.”\n\nPao-chai had only been teasing. But now Tai-yu’s remark reminded her of that earlier reference to reading improper books, and she decided not to carry the joke any further but let her up.\n\n“That’s cousinly of you,” said Tai-yu. “If it were me, I wouldn’t be so forgiving.”\n\nPao-chai pointed at her smilingly. “No wonder the old lady dotes on you and everyone loves you. I declare, I’m growing quite fond of you myself. Come here and let me do your hair for you.”\n\nTai-yu turned her head accordingly and Pao-chai smoothed back her hair for her. Pao-yu, watching, thought it even more becoming and regretted having smoothed her hair back earlier.\n\n“I shouldn’t have done that,” he thought. “I should have left it for her to do now.”\n\nWhile he was indulging in these wild fancies, Pao-chai announced, “That’s the list finished. We’ll show it to the old lady tomorrow. If we’ve the things at home, well and good. If not, we can buy them. I’ll help you to prepare them.”\n\nPao-yu hastily put the list away.\n\nThey chatted for a while longer, and after dinner went to pay their evening respects to the Lady Dowager. Her slight indisposition had been due simply to fatigue and a chill. After a day’s rest and a couple of doses of medicine to induce perspiration, by evening she had recovered.\n\nIf you want to know what followed, read the next chapter."
