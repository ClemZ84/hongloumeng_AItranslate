  "original": "话说赖大带了贾芹出来，一宿无话，静候贾政回来。单是那些女尼女道重进园来，都喜欢的了不得，欲要到各处逛逛，明日预备迸宫。不料赖大使吩咐了看园的婆子并小厮看守，惟给了些饭食，却是一步不准走开。那些女孩子摸不着头脑，只得坐着，等到天亮。园里各处的丫头虽都知道拉进女尼们来，预备宫里使唤，却也不能深知原委。\n　　到了明日早起，贾政正要下班，因堂上发下两省城工估销册子，立刻要查核，一时不能回家，便叫人回来告诉贾琏，说：“赖大回来，你务必查问明白。该如何办就如何办了，不必等我。”贾琏奉命，先替芹儿喜欢，又想道：“若是办得一点影儿都没有，又恐贾政生疑，不如回明二太太，讨个主意办去，便是不合老爷的心，我也不至甚担干系。”主意定了，进内去见王夫人，陈说：“昨日老爷见了揭帖生气，把芹儿和女尼女道等都叫进府来查办。今日老爷没空问这件不成体统的事，叫我来回太太，该怎么便怎么样。我所以来请示太太，这件事如何办理？”\n　　王夫人听了诧异道：“这是怎么说！若是芹儿这么样起来，这还成咱们家的人了么？但只这个贴帖儿的也可恶，这些话可是混嚼说得的么？你到底问了芹儿有这件事没有呢？”贾琏道：“刚才也问过了。太太想，别说他干了没有，就是干了，一个人干了混账事也肯应承么？但只我想芹儿也不敢行此事：知道那些女孩子都是娘娘一时要的，倘或闹出事来，怎么样呢？依侄儿的主见，要问也不难，若问出来，太太怎么个办法呢？”王夫人道：“如今那些女孩子在那里？”贾琏道：“都在园里锁着呢。”王夫人道：“姑娘们知道不知道？”贾琏道：“大约姑娘们也都知道是预备宫里头的话，外头并没提起别的来。”王夫人道：“很是。这些东西一刻也是留不得的。头里我原要打发他门去来着，都是你们说留着好，如今不是弄出事来了么？你竟叫赖大带了去细细儿的问他的本家儿有人没有，将文书查出，花上几十两银子，雇只船，派个妥当人，送到本地，一概连文书发还了，也落得无事。若是为着一两个不好，个个都押着他们还俗，那又太造孽了。若在这里发给官媒，虽然我们不要身价，他们弄去卖钱，那里顾人的死活呢？芹儿呢，你便狠狠的说他一顿，除了祭祖喜庆，无事叫他不用到这里来。看仔细碰在老爷气头儿上，那可就吃不了兜着走了。也说给账房儿里，把这一项钱粮档子销了。还打发个人到水月庵，说老爷的谕，除了上坟烧纸，要有本家爷们到他那里去，不许接待。若再有一点不好风声，连老姑子一块儿撵出去。”\n　　贾琏一一答应了。出去将王夫人的话告诉赖大，说：“太太的主意，叫你这么办。办完了，告诉我去回太太。你快办去罢。回来老爷来，你也按着太太的话回去。”赖大听说，便道：“我们太太真正是个佛心。这班东西还着人送回去，既是太太好心，不得不挑个好人。芹哥儿竟交给二爷开发了罢。那贴帖儿的，奴才想法儿查出来，重重的收拾他才好。”贾琏点头说：“是了。”即刻将贾芹发落。赖大也赶着把女尼等领出，按着主意办去了。晚上贾政回来，贾琏赖大回明贾政，贾政本是省事的人，听了也便撂开手了。独有那些无赖之徒，听得贾府发出二十四个女孩子来，那个不想？究竟那些人能够回家不能，未知着落，亦难虚拟。\n　　且说紫鹃因黛玉渐好，园中无事，听见女尼等预备宫内使唤，不知何事便到贾母那边打听打听。恰遇着鸳鸯下来闲着，坐下说闲话儿，提起女尼的事，鸳鸯诧异道：“我并没有听见。回来问问二奶奶就知道了。”正说着，只见傅试家两个女人过来请贾母的安，鸳鸯要陪了上去。那两个女人因贾母正睡晌觉，就与鸳鸯说了一声儿，回去了。紫鹃问：“这是谁家差来的？”鸳鸯道：“好讨人嫌！家里有了一个女孩儿，长的好些儿，就献宝的似的，常在老太太跟前夸他们姑娘怎么长的好，心地儿怎么好，‘礼貌上又好，说话儿又简绝，做活计儿手又巧，会写会算，尊长上头最孝敬的，就是待下人也是极和平的。’来了就编这么一大套，常说给老太太听。我听着很烦。这几个老婆子真讨人嫌，我们老太太偏爱听那些个话。老太太也罢了，还有宝玉，素常见了老婆子便很厌烦的，偏见了他们家的老婆子不厌烦，你说奇不奇？前儿还来说：他们姑娘现有多少人家儿来求亲，他们老爷总不肯应，心里只要和咱们这样人家作亲才肯。夸奖一回，奉承一回，把老太太的心都说活了。”\n　　紫鹃听了一呆，便假意道：“若老太太喜欢，为什么不就给宝玉定了呢？”鸳鸯正要说出原故，听见上头说：“老太太醒了。”鸳鸯赶着上去，紫鹃只得起身出来。回到园里，一面走，一头想道，“天下莫非只有一个宝玉？你也想他，我也想他。我们家的那一位，越发痴心起来了！看他的那个神情儿，是一定在宝玉身上的了，三番两次的病，可不是为着这个是什么？这家里‘金’的‘银’的还闹不清，再添上一个什么傅姑娘，更了不得了。我看宝玉的心也在我们那一位的身上啊，听着鸳鸯的话，竟是见一个爱一个的。这不是我们姑娘白操了心吗？”紫鹃本是想着黛玉，往下一想，连自己也不得主意了，不免神都痴了。想要叫黛玉不用瞎操心呢，又恐怕他烦恼；要是看着他这样，又可怜见儿的。左思右想，一时烦躁起来，自己啐自己道：“你替人耽什么忧？就是林姑娘真配了宝玉，他的那性情儿也是难伏侍的。宝玉性情虽好，又是贪多嚼不烂的。我倒劝人不必瞎操心，我自己才是瞎操心呢，从今以后，我尽我的心伏侍姑娘，其馀的事全不管。”这么一想，心里倒觉清静。回到潇湘馆来，见黛玉独自一人坐在炕上，理从前做过的诗文词稿。抬头见紫鹃进来，便问：“你到那里去了？”紫鹃道：“今儿瞧了瞧姐妹们去。”黛玉道：“可是找袭人姐姐去么？”紫鹃道：“我找他做什么？”黛玉一想：“这话怎么顺嘴说出来了呢？”反觉不好意思，便啐道：“你找不找与我什么相干！倒茶去罢。”\n　　紫鹃也心里暗笑，出来倒茶。只听园里一叠声乱嚷，不知何故。一面倒茶，一面叫人去打听。回来说道：“怡红院里的海棠本来萎了几棵，也没人去浇灌他。昨日宝玉走去瞧，见枝头上好象有了朵儿似的。人都不信，没有理他。忽然今日开的很好的海棠花，众人诧异，都争着去看，连老太太、太太都哄动了，来瞧花儿呢。所以大奶奶叫人收拾园里的树叶子，这些人在那里传唤。”黛玉也听见了，知道老太太来，便更了衣，叫雪雁去打听：“若是老太太来了，即来告诉我。”雪雁去不多时，便跑来说：“老太太、太太好些人都来了，请姑娘就去罢。”黛玉略自照了一照镜子，掠了一掠鬓发，便扶着紫鹃到怡红院来，已见老太太坐在宝玉常卧的榻上。黛玉便说道：“请老太太安。”退后便见了邢王二夫人，回来与李纨、探春、惜春、邢岫烟彼此问了好。只有凤姐因病未来；史湘云因他叔叔调任回京，接了家去；薛宝琴跟他姐姐家去住了；李家姐妹因见园内多事，李婶娘带了在外居住；所以黛玉今日见的只有数人。\n　　大家说笑了一回，讲究这花开得古怪。贾母道：“这花儿应在三月里开的，如今虽是十一月，因节气迟，还算十月，应着小阳春的天气，因为和暖，开花也是有的。”王夫人道：“老太太见的多，说得是，也不为奇。”邢夫人道：“我听见这花已经萎了一年，怎么这回不应时候儿开了？必有个原故。”李纨笑道：“老太太和太太说的都是。据我的糊涂想头，必是宝玉有喜事来了，此花先来报信。”探春虽不言语，心里想道：“必非好兆。大凡顺者昌，逆者亡；草木知运，不时而发，必是妖孽。”但只不好说出来。独有黛玉听说是喜事心里触动，便高兴说道：“当初田家有荆树一棵，弟兄三个因分了家，那荆树便枯了。后来感动了他弟兄们，仍旧归在一处，那荆树也就荣了。可知草木也随人的。如今二哥哥认真念书，舅舅喜欢，那棵树也就发了。”贾母王夫人听了喜欢，便说：“林姑娘比方得有理，很有意思。”\n　　正说着，贾赦、贾政、贾环、贾兰都进来看花。贾赦便说：“据我的主意，把他砍去。必是花妖作怪。”贾政道：“见怪不怪，其怪自败。不用砍他，随他去就是了。”贾母听见，便说：“谁在这里混说？人家有喜事好处，什么怪不怪的。若有好事，你们享去；若是不好，我一个人当去。你们不许混说！”贾政听了，不敢言语，讪讪的同贾赦等走了出来。\n　　那贾母高兴，叫人传话到厨房里：“快快预备酒席，大家赏花。”叫宝玉、环儿、兰儿：“各人做一首诗志喜。林姑娘的病才好，别叫他费心，若高兴，给你们改改。”对着李纨道：“你们都陪我喝酒。”李纨答应了是，便笑对探春笑道：“都是你闹的。”探春道：“饶不叫我们做诗，怎么我们闹的？”李纨道：“海棠社不是你起的么？如今那棵海棠也要来入社了。”大家听着都笑了。\n　　一时摆上酒菜，一面喝着，彼此都要讨老太太的喜欢，大家说些兴头话。宝玉上来斟了酒，便立成了四句诗，写出来念与贾母听，道：\n　　海棠何事忽摧？今日繁花为底开？\n　　应是北堂增寿考，一阳旋复占先梅。\n　　贾环也写了来，念道：\n　　草木逢春当茁芽，海棠未发候偏差。\n　　人间奇事知多少，冬月开花独我家。\n　　贾兰恭楷誊正，呈与贾母。贾母命李纨念道：\n　　烟凝媚色春前萎，霜追微红雪后开。\n　　莫道此花知识浅，欣荣预佐合欢杯。\n　　贾母听毕，便说：“我不大懂诗，听去倒是兰儿的好，环儿做的不好。都上来吃饭罢。”宝玉看见贾母喜欢，更是兴头，因想起：“晴雯死的那年，海棠死的；今日海棠复荣，我们院内这些人，自然都好，但是晴雯不能象花的死而复生了。”顿觉转喜为悲。忽又想起前日巧姐提凤姐要把五儿补入。“或此花为此而开，也未可知。”却又转悲为喜，依旧说笑。\n　　贾母还坐了半天，然后扶了珍珠回去了，王夫人等跟着过来。只见平儿笑嘻嘻的迎上来，说：“我们奶奶知道老太太在这里赏花，自己不得来，叫奴才来伏侍老太太、太太们。还有两匹红送宝二爷包裹这花，当作贺礼。”袭人过来接了，呈与贾母看。贾母笑道：“偏是凤丫头行出点事儿来，叫人看着又体面，又新鲜，很有趣儿。”袭人笑着向平儿道：“回去替宝二爷给二奶奶道谢：要有喜，大家喜。”贾母听了，笑道：“嗳哟！我还忘了呢。凤丫头虽病着，还是他想的到，送的也巧。”一面说着，众人就随着去了。平儿私与袭人道：“奶奶说，这花儿开的怪，叫你铰块红绸子挂挂，就应在喜事上去了。以后也不必只管当作奇事混说。”袭人点头答应，送了平儿出去不提。\n　　且说那日宝玉本来穿着一裹圆的皮袄在家歇息，因见花开，只管出来看一回、赏一回、叹一回、爱一回的，心中无数悲喜离合，都弄到这株花上去了。忽然听说贾母要来，便去换了一件狐腋箭袖，罩一件玄狐腿外褂，出来迎接贾母。匆匆穿换，未将“通灵宝玉”挂上。及至后来贾母去了，仍旧换衣，袭人见宝玉脖子上没有挂着，便问：“那块玉呢？”宝玉道：“刚才忙乱换衣，摘下来放在炕桌上，我没有带。”袭人回看桌上，并没有玉，便向各处找寻，踪影全无，吓得袭人满身冷汗。宝玉道：“不用着急，少不得在屋里的。问他们就知道了。”袭人当作麝月等藏起吓他玩，便向麝月等笑着说道：“小蹄子们，玩呢，到底有个玩法。把这件东西藏在那里了？别真弄丢了，那可就大家活不成了！”麝月等都正色道：“这是那里的话？玩是玩，笑是笑，这个事非同儿戏，你可别混说。你自己昏了心了，想想罢，想想搁在那里了？这会子又混赖人了！”袭人见他这般光景不象是玩话，便着急迫：“皇天菩萨！小祖宗！你到底撂在那里了？”宝玉道：“我记的明明儿放在炕桌上，你们到底找啊。”\n　　袭人麝月等也不敢叫人知道，大家偷偷儿的各处搜寻。闹了大半天，毫无影响，甚至翻箱倒笼，实在没处去找，便疑到方才这些人进来，不知谁检了去了。袭人说道：“进来的，谁不知道这玉是性命似的东西呢？谁敢检了去！你们好歹先别声张，快到各处问去。若有姐妹们检着和我们玩呢，你们给他磕个头，要了来；要是小丫头们偷了去，问出来，也不回上头，不论做些什么送他换了来，都使得的。这可不是小事，真要丢了这个，比丢了宝二爷的还利害呢！”麝月秋纹刚要往外走，袭人又赶出来嘱咐道：“头里在这里吃饭的倒别先问去。找不成，再惹出些风波来，更不好了。”麝月等依言，分头各处追问。人人不晓，个个惊疑。二人连忙回来，俱目瞪口呆，面面相窥。宝玉也吓怔了，袭人急的只是干哭。找是没处找，回又不敢回，怡红院里的人吓的一个个象木雕泥塑一般。\n　　大家正在发呆，只见各处知道的都来了。探春叫把园门关上，先叫个老婆子带着两个丫头，再往各处去寻去；一而又叫告诉众人：“若谁找出来，重重的赏他。”大家头宗要脱干系，二宗听见重赏，不顾命的混找了一遍，甚至于茅厕里都找到了。谁知那块玉竟象绣花针儿一般，找了一天，总无影响。李纨急了，说：“这件事不是玩的，我要说句无礼的话了。”众人道：“什么话？”李纨道：“事情到了这里也顾不得了。现在园里除了宝玉，都是女人。要求各位姐姐、妹妹、姑娘都要叫跟来的丫头脱了衣服，大家搜一搜。若没有，再叫丫头们去搜那些老婆子并粗使的丫头，不知使得使不得？”大家说道：“这话也说的有理。现在人多手乱，鱼龙混杂，倒是这么着，他们也洗洗清。”探春独不言语。那些丫头们也都愿意洗净自己。先是平儿起，平儿说道：“打我先搜起。”于是各人自己解怀。李纨一气儿混搜。探春嗔着李纨道：“大嫂子，你也学那起不成材料的样子来了！那个人既偷了去还肯藏在身上？况且这件东西，在家里是宝，到了外头不知道的是废物，偷他做什么？我想来必是有人使促狭。”\n　　众人听说，又见环儿不在这里，昨儿是他满屋里乱跑，都疑到他身上，只是不肯说出来。探春又道：“使促狭的只有环儿。你们叫个人去俏悄的叫了他来，背地里哄着他，叫他拿出来，然后吓着他叫他别声张就完了。”大家点头。李执便向平儿道：“这件事还得你去才弄的明白。”平儿答应，就赶着去了。不多时，同着贾环来了。众人假意装出没事的样子，叫人沏了茶，搁在里间屋里。众人故意搭仙走开，原叫平儿哄他。平儿便笑着向贾环道：“你二哥哥的玉丢了，你瞧见了没有？”贾环便急的紫涨了脸，瞪着眼，说道：“人家丢了东西，你怎么又叫我来查问疑我！我是犯过案的贼么？”平儿见这样子，倒不敢再问，便又陪笑道：“不是这么说。怕三爷要拿了去吓他们，所以白问问瞧见了没有，好叫他们找。”贾环道：“他的玉在他身上，看见没看见该问他，怎么问我呢？你们都捧着他，得了什么不问我，丢了东西就来问我！”说着，起身就走。众人不好拦他。这里宝玉倒急了，说道：“都是这劳什子闹事！我也不要他了，你们也不用闹了。环儿一去，必是嚷的满院里都知道了，这可不是闹事了么？”袭人等急的又哭道：“小祖宗儿，你看这玉丢了没要紧：要是上头知道了，我们这些人就要粉身碎骨了。”说着，便嚎啕大哭起来。\n　　众人更加着急，明知此事掩饰不来，只得要商议定了话，回来好回贾母诸人。宝玉道：“你们竟也不用商量，硬说我砸了就完了。”平儿道：“我的爷，好轻巧话儿！上头要问为什么砸的呢？他们也是个死啊。倘或要起砸破的碴儿来，那又怎么样呢？”宝玉道：“不然，就说我出门丢了。”众人一想：“这句话倒还混的过去，但只这两天又没上学，又没往别处去。”宝玉道：“怎么没有？大前儿还到临安伯府里听戏去了呢。就说那日丢的就完了。”探春道：“那也不妥。既是前儿丢的，为什么当日不来回？”众人正在胡思乱想要装点撤谎，只听见赵姨娘的声儿哭着喊着走来，说：“你们丢了东西，自己不找，怎么叫人背地里拷问环儿！我把环儿带了来，索性交给你们这一起上水的，该杀该剐随你们罢！”说着将环儿一推，说：“你是个贼，快快的招罢！”气的环儿也哭喊起来。\n　　李执正要劝解，丫头来说：“太太来了。”袭人等此时无地可容。宝玉等赶忙出来迎接。赵姨娘暂且也不敢作声，跟了出来。王夫人见众人都有惊惶之色，才信方才听见的话，便道：“那块玉真丢了么？”众人都不敢作声。王夫人走进屋里坐下，便叫袭人，慌的袭人连忙跪下，含泪要禀。王夫人道：“你起来，快快叫人细细的找去，一忙乱倒不好了。”袭人哽咽难言。宝玉恐袭人直告诉出来，便说道：“太太，这事不与袭人相干，是我前日到临安伯府里听戏在路上丢了。”王夫人道：“为什么那日不找呢？”宝玉道：“我怕他们知道，没有告诉他们。我叫焙茗等在外头各处找过的。”王夫人道：“胡说，如今脱换衣服，不是袭人他们伏侍的么？大凡哥儿出门回来，手巾荷包短了，还要个明白，何况这块玉不见了，难道不问么？”宝玉无言可答。赵姨娘听见，便得意了，忙接口道：“外头丢了东西，也赖环儿。”话未说完，被王夫人喝道：“这里说这个，你且说那些没要紧的话！”赵姨娘便也不敢言语了。还是李执、探春从实的告诉了王夫人一遍。王夫人也急的眼中落泪，索性要回明了贾母，去问邢夫人那边来的这些人去。\n　　凤姐病中也听见宝玉失玉，知道王夫人过来，料躲不住，便扶了丰儿来到园里。正值王夫人起身要走，凤姐娇怯怯的说：“请太太安。”宝玉等过来问了凤姐好。王夫人因说道：“你也听见了么？这可不是奇事吗？刚才眼错不见就丢了，再找不着。你去想想，打老太太那边的丫头起，至你们平儿，谁的手不稳，谁的心促狭，我要回了老太太，认真的查出来才好。不然，是断了宝玉的命根子了！”凤姐回道：“咱们家人多手杂，自古说的，‘知人知面不知心’，那里保的住谁是好的？但只一吵嚷，已经都知道了，偷玉的人要叫太太查出来，明知是死无葬身之地，他着了急，反要毁坏了灭口，那时可怎么处呢。据我的糊涂想头，只说宝玉本不爱他，撂丢了，也没有什么要紧，只要大家严密些，别叫老太太、老爷知道。这么说了，暗暗的派人去各处察访，哄骗出来，那时玉也可得，罪名也可定。不知太太心里怎么样？”王夫人迟了半日，才说道：“你这话虽也有理，但只是老爷跟前怎么瞒的过呢？”便叫环儿来说道：“你二哥哥的玉丢了，白问了你一句，怎么你就乱嚷？要是嚷破了，人家把那个毁坏了，我看你活得活不得！”贾环吓得哭道：“我再不敢嚷了。”赵姨娘听了，那里还敢言语。王夫人便吩咐众人道：“想来自然有没找到的地方儿。好端端的在家里的，还怕他飞到那里去不成？只是不许声张。限袭人三天内给我找出来。要是三天找不着，只怕也瞒不住，大家那就不用过安静日子了！”说着，便叫凤姐儿跟到邢夫人那边，商议踩缉不提。\n　　这里李纨等纷纷议论，便传唤看园子的一干人来，叫把园门锁上，快传林之孝家的来，悄悄儿的告诉了他，叫他：“吩咐前后门上；三天之内，不论男女下人，从里头可以走动，要出去时，一概不许放出。只说里头丢了东西，等这件东西有了着落，然后放人出来。”林之孝家的答应了“是”，因说：“前儿奴才家里也丢了一件不要紧的东西，林之孝必要明白，上街去找了一个测宇的。那人叫做什么刘铁嘴，测了一个字，说的很明白，回来按着一找，就找着了。”袭人听见，便央及林家的道：“好林奶奶，出去快求林大爷替我们问问去。”那林之孝家的答应着出去了。邢岫烟道：“若说那外头测字打卦的，是不中用的。我在南边闻妙玉能扶乩，何不烦他问一问？况且我听见说，这块玉原有仙机，想来问的出来。”众人都诧异道：“咱们常见的，从没有听他说起。”麝月便忙问岫烟道：“想来别人求他是不肯的，好姑娘，我给姑娘磕个头，求姑娘就去！若问出来了，我一辈子总不忘你的恩。”说着，赶忙就要磕下头去，岫烟连忙拦住。黛玉等也都怂恿着岫烟速往栊翠庵去。\n　　一面林之孝家的进来说道：“姑娘们大喜！林之孝测了字回来，说这玉是丢不了的，将来横竖有人送还来的。”众人听了，也都半信半疑；惟有袭人、麝月喜欢的了不得。探春便问：“测的是什么字？”林之孝家的道：“他的话多，奴才也学不上来。记得是拈了个赏人东西的‘赏’字。那刘铁嘴也不问，便说：‘丢了东西不是？’”李纨道：“这就算好。”林之孝家的道：“他还说：““赏”字上头一个“小”字底下一个“口”字，这件东西，很可嘴里放得，必是个珠子宝石。’”众人听了，夸赞道：“真是神仙！往下怎么说？”林之孝家的道：“他说：‘底下“贝”字拆开，不成一个“见”字，可不是“不见”了？’因上头拆了‘当’字，叫快到当铺里找去。‘赏’字加一‘人’字，可不是‘偿’字？只要找着当铺就有人，有了人便赎了来，可不是偿还了吗？”众人道：“既这么着，就先往左近找起。横竖几个当铺都找遍了，少不得就有了。咱们有了东西，再问人就容易了。”李纨道：“只要东西，那怕不问人都使得。林嫂子你去，就把测字的话快告诉了二奶奶，回了太太，也叫太太放心。就叫二奶奶快派人查去。”林家的答应了便走。\n众人略安了一点儿神，呆呆的等岫烟回来。正呆等时，只见跟宝玉的焙茗在门外招手儿，叫小丫头子快出来。那小丫头赶忙的出去了。焙茗便说道：“你快进去告诉我们二爷和里头太太、奶奶、姑娘们，天大的喜事！”那小丫头子道：“你快说罢，怎么这么累赘？”焙茗笑着拍手道：“我告诉姑娘，姑娘进去回了，咱们两个人都得赏钱呢。你打量是什么事情？宝二爷的那块玉呀，我得了准信儿来了。”\n未知如何，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Lai Da led Jia Qin out, and there was no more trouble that night as they waited for Jia Zheng to return. The nuns and Taoist novices, re-admitted to the Garden, were overjoyed and wanted to stroll around to see the different scenes, ready to enter the Palace the next day. But Lai Da had instructed the women and pages in charge of the Garden to keep a close watch on them. They were given meals but not allowed to take a single step outside. The girls, completely mystified, could only sit there and wait for daylight.\n\nAlthough the maids in the Garden knew that these nuns had been brought in to wait upon the Imperial Consort, they were not clear about the details.\n\nThe next morning Jia Zheng, meaning to come home after court, was handed two account-books of estimates for city construction work in two provinces which had to be checked at once. As this would delay his return, he sent a servant to tell Jia Lian, “When Lai Da comes back, be sure to question him closely. Do whatever has to be done; don’t wait for me.”\n\nJia Lian having received these orders was first of all delighted for Jia Qin’s sake. Then it occurred to him, “If I handle this in such a way that no trace is left, the master may suspect a cover-up. I’d better report to the mistress and ask for her instructions. Then even if it isn’t quite to the master’s liking, I shan’t be held to blame.”\n\nHis mind made up, he went in to see Lady Wang and said, “Yesterday the master was angry when he saw that poster and had Jia Qin as well as the nuns and novices brought here to investigate. Today he’s too busy to see to this scandal, so he’s told me to report to you, madam, and do whatever you think fit. That’s why I’ve come to ask your instructions.”\n\n“How extraordinary!” exclaimed Lady Wang in surprise. “If Jia Qin has really done such a thing, how can he be considered one of our clan? But the writer of that poster is detestable too. How could he put such wild accusations in writing? Did you question Jia Qin as to whether it’s true or not?”\n\n“I did, just now. But you know, madam, even if he had done such a thing he’d never admit it. However, I don’t think he’d have the nerve for such goings-on. He knows those girls have been demanded by the Imperial Consort, so what if trouble came of it? In my opinion, it wouldn’t be hard to get the truth out of them; but if we did, what would you do about it, madam?”\n\n“Where are those girls now?”\n\n“Locked up in the Garden.”\n\n“Do the young ladies know about this?”\n\n“I suppose they know the girls were to wait on the Imperial Consort, but nothing else has been said.”\n\n“Quite right. We mustn’t keep those girls a moment longer. I meant to send them away before, but you all said they should stay, and now this has happened. Tell Lai Da to take them away and question them closely to find out if they have families or not. Get out their written contracts, spend a few dozen taels of silver, hire a boat and send reliable men to take them back to their own place. Then give them back their contracts, and that will be the end of the matter. If because one or two of them have misbehaved we force them all to return to secular life, that would be a sin. And if we turn them over to official go-betweens here, though we wouldn’t ask for any payment, those go-betweens would sell them for money without caring whether they live or die.\n\n“As for Jia Qin, give him a good talking-to. Apart from ancestral sacrifices or celebrations, he’s not to come here unless sent for. If he offends the master again when he’s in a temper, he’ll be sorry for it — he’ll get more than he bargained for. Tell the accountants to cancel this item in the accounts. And send someone to Water Moon Convent to inform them of the master’s orders: Apart from going to the grave to sacrifice or burn paper money, if men of our house go there they are not to be received. If there is any more talk of misconduct, the old abbess will be turned out too.”\n\nJia Lian assented to all her instructions.\n\nHaving agreed to this, Jia Lian went out and gave Lai Da Lady Wang’s instructions, adding, “Her Ladyship wants you to see to this. When it’s done, let me know so that I can report to her. Lose no time, now. And when the master comes back, you’re to answer him as Her Ladyship said.”\n\n“Her Ladyship is really a Buddha at heart,” replied Lai Da. “Since she’s good enough to have these creatures escorted back, we must pick reliable men for the job. As for young Master Qin, please deal with him, sir. I’ll think of some way to find out who wrote that placard and punish the scoundrel severely.”\n\nJia Lian nodded. “Right.” He at once sentenced Jia Qin. And Lai Da lost no time in leading the nuns out of the Garden to carry out Lady Wang’s orders.\n\nThat evening when Jia Zheng came home, Jia Lian and Lai Da reported this to him. Being a man who liked to avoid trouble, he let the matter drop then. But when the local scoundrels heard that the Jia family had turned twenty-four young nuns and novices out of their nunnery, they were all eager to get hold of them. However, we do not know whether these girls were able to go home or not, or what became of them.\n\nMeanwhile, Zijuan had nothing to do in the Garden now that Daiyu was better. Hearing that the nuns were being prepared to serve in the Palace, not knowing what this meant she went to the Lady Dowager’s apartments to find out. She found Yuanyang at leisure and sat down to have a chat with her. Asked about the nuns, Yuanyang exclaimed in surprise:\n\n“I’d not heard of it. I’ll ask the second mistress later.”\n\nJust then two serving-women from the Fu family arrived to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager. As Yuanyang had to accompany them in, Zijuan stayed where she was.\n\nThe old women, informed that Her Ladyship was taking a nap, said goodbye to Yuanyang and left.\n\n“Who sent those two women?” asked Zijuan.\n\n“They’re a pest!” Yuanyang spat out. “Just because they have a daughter who’s not bad-looking, they show her off as if she were a treasure. They’re always telling the old lady how pretty and good-natured their young mistress is, so well-bred, so concise in her speech, so clever at needlework, able to read and write and do accounts, most dutiful to her elders and very good to the servants as well. They come and spout a whole rigmarole which the old lady loves to hear. I find it quite sickening. These old women are a pest, yet our old lady dotes on them. That’s all right for her, but even Baoyu who normally can’t stand old women like these doesn’t find them a nuisance. Isn’t that strange? The other day they came and said: ‘So many families have asked for our young lady’s hand, but our master won’t give his consent. He’s only willing to marry her into a family like yours.’ So they praised and flattered until they’ve quite won over the old lady.”\n\nZijuan was taken aback but pretended to be pleased. “If the old lady’s so fond of her, why doesn’t she settle the match with Baoyu?”\n\nYuanyang was just going to explain when someone called from upstairs, “The old lady’s awake.” She hurried upstairs, and Zijuan went back to the Garden.\n\nAs she walked along she thought, “Is Baoyu the only boy in the world? You want him, I want him. But our young lady’s even more infatuated. From the way she carries on, she’s set her heart on him. Isn’t that the cause of the relapses she’s been having so often? In this household they’ve not even straightened out the business of the gold and the silver, and now here comes some Miss Fu to complicate things even more! It seems to me, though, that Baoyu’s heart is set on our young mistress too. But from what Yuanyang said, he’s attracted to any girl. Wasn’t our young lady just wasting her feelings?”\n\nShe had been thinking of Daiyu, but this train of thought now carried her away until she couldn’t think straight and became quite bemused. She thought of advising Daiyu not to worry her head over Baoyu.\n\nFearing she might upset her, and yet sorry for her, she fretted to herself until she grew quite frantic and spat in disgust.\n\n“Why worry about other people?” she scolded herself. “Even if Miss Lin is to marry Baoyu, she’s too temperamental to be easy to live with. And though Baoyu’s a good sort, he’s so crazy he’d bite off more than he could chew. I should advise people not to worry their heads over nothing. I’m the one who’s been worrying over nothing. From now on I’ll just do my duty by my young lady, and not trouble my head with anything else.”\n\nThis decision set her mind at rest. Upon her return to Bamboo Lodge she found Daiyu sitting alone on the couch going through her old poems and verses. At sight of Zijuan she asked where she had been.\n\n“I called on the other girls.”\n\n“To see Xiren, I suppose?”\n\n“What should I want to see her for?”\n\nDaiyu realized that she had spoken without thinking and flushed.\n\n“What’s it to me whether you go to see her or not?” she retorted. “Fetch me some tea.”\n\nZijuan smiled to herself as she went out to do this. Then a great hubbub broke out in the Garden and she wondered what had happened. While making the tea she sent to find out, and was told:\n\n“Some of the crab-apple trees in Happy Red Court had withered, and nobody had watered them. Yesterday Baoyu went to have a look, and said there were buds on the stems. Nobody believed him and they took no notice. But today those trees are covered with beautiful blossom. Everyone’s amazed and rushing to see. Even the old lady and the mistress have heard and gone to look. So Madam Zhu has ordered the leaves in the Garden to be swept, and the servants are making a commotion.”\n\nDaiyu heard this too. Knowing that the Lady Dowager was there she changed her clothes and told Xueyan to go and find out if her grandmother had come.\n\n“If the old lady’s there, let me know,” she said.\n\nXueyan soon came back to report, “The old lady and the mistress have come with ever so many people. Please go over, miss.”\n\nDaiyu glanced in the mirror and smoothed her hair, then leaning on Zijuan’s arm she went to Happy Red Court. The Lady Dowager was already there, seated on the couch where Baoyu usually slept.\n\nDaiyu paid her respects and said, “How are you, grandmother?” Then she greeted Lady Xing and Lady Wang and exchanged greetings with Li Wan, Tanchun, Xichun and Xiuyan. Xifeng was absent because of her illness; Xiangyun had gone home as her uncle had returned to the capital and sent for her; Baoqin had gone to stay with her cousin; and Aunt Li had taken her two daughters to live outside because there had been so much trouble in the Garden. So only a few people were present that day.\n\nThey chatted for a while about the strange blossoming of the tree.\n\n“This flower normally blooms in the third month,” said the Lady Dowager. “Although it’s the eleventh month now, because the solar terms are late this is still the tenth month, corresponding to ‘little spring,’ and the weather is so warm today that it’s not too surprising.”\n\n“You’re right, madam, you have more experience,” said Lady Wang. “It’s not so very extraordinary.”\n\n“I heard that this tree had withered for a whole year,” put in Lady Xing. “Why should it blossom again out of season? There must be some reason.”\n\n“I agree with the old lady and madam,” said Li Wan with a smile. “In my silly opinion, this may be an omen of some happy event in store for Baoyu.”\n\nTanchun said nothing but thought, “This can’t be a good omen. All things that flourish at the wrong season are freaks. I suspect something bad is going to happen.” But she kept this to herself.\n\nDaiyu on the other hand, at the mention of a happy event, was overjoyed.\n\n“The thorn-eltm in the Tian family withered when the brothers parted, but blossomed again when they were reunited,” she said. “Now this crab-apple tree has withered for some time, but today it’s flowering again. So it’s true that growing plants are influenced by human affairs.”\n\nYou know plants are affected by their owners. Now that Cousin Pao-yu is studying hard and his father’s pleased, that tree has put out blossoms.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and Lady Wang, pleased by this, said, “That’s a good way of putting it by Miss Lin. It makes sense.”\n\nJust then Chia Sheh, Chia Cheng, Chia Huan and Chia Lan came in to see the blossom.\n\nChia Sheh said, “In my opinion, it should be cut down. It must be a flower demon causing trouble.”\n\nChia Cheng demurred, “If you ignore such manifestations, they stop of themselves. There’s no need to cut it down.”\n\nThe old lady overhearing them interposed, “Who’s talking such nonsense here? If it’s a happy omen, what does it matter if it’s uncanny? If this bodes well, you can share the blessing; if not, I’ll take the bad luck on myself. Don’t talk such rubbish!”\n\nChia Cheng dared not argue but sheepishly followed Chia Sheh out.\n\nThen the Lady Dowager, in high spirits, sent to the kitchen, “Prepare a feast at once. We’re going to enjoy the blossom.” She told Pao-yu, Chia Huan and Chia Lan, “Each of you write a poem to celebrate this. Miss Lin has only just got over her illness, so don’t trouble her. If she feels like it, she can correct your verses.” To Li Wan she said, “You must all keep me company over the wine.”\n\nLi Wan assented, then teased Tan-chun, “This is all your doing.”\n\n“We’re not even being asked to write poems, so how is it my doing?”\n\n“Wasn’t it you who started the Begonia Club? Now that crab-apple tree wants to join it.”\n\nThis set them all laughing.\n\nSoon the wine and dishes were served. As they drank they vied in saying things to please the old lady. Pao-yu, having filled her cup with wine, at once composed a quatrain which he wrote out and read to her:\n\nWhy did the crab-apple wither away?\nWhat makes it bloom so brightly now today?\nIt augurs long life for our honoured mother;\nThis winter it has blossomed before the mume flower.\n\nThen Chia Huan read out his poem:\n\nPlants burgeon in spring, putting out new shoots;\nThe crab-apple’s late because it made mistake.\nHow many marvels are there under heaven?\nIn winter our family alone has flowers.\n\nChia Lan carefully wrote out his poem in the regular style and presented it to the Lady Dowager, who ordered Li Wan to read it out:\n\nIts charm congealed, it languished before spring;\nIts faint flush chilled by frost, it blooms after snow.\nDon’t say this flower has little sense of feeling;\nIts glorious flowering foretells a nuptial feast.\n\nWhen the old lady had heard it she said, “I’m no judge of poetry, but it seems to me that Lan’s is the best and Huan’s is no good. Come now, all of you, to the meal.”\n\nPao-yu, seeing how pleased his grandmother was, felt even more elated. Then he recalled that the crab-apple had withered the year Ching-wen died, and now that it had come to life again, all the girls in their compound should have good fortune — but Ching-wen could not come back to life like this flower. This thought changed his joy to grief, until he remembered that the other day, Chiao-chieh had told him that Hsi-feng meant to give him Wu-erh to take Ching-wen’s place. Maybe the flower had blossomed for her sake? That changed his grief back to joy and he went on chatting and laughing.\n\nThe old lady sat there a little longer before letting Pearl help her back, followed by Lady Wang and the rest. They found Ping-erh waiting for them with a smile.\n\n“My mistress heard that you were enjoying the blossom, madam, but couldn’t come herself,” she said. “So she sent me to wait on you, madam and my lady. She’s also sending Pao-yu two rolls of red silk to cover the plant with, by way of congratulations.”\n\nHsi-jen stepped forward to take the silk and show it to the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Hsi-feng is up to her tricks again!” chuckled the old lady. “Still, it shows good taste and is a novel idea — very amusing.”\n\nHsi-jen told Ping-erh with a smile, “When you go back, thank your mistress from Pao-yu. If this is an omen of good fortune, we shall all share it.”\n\nThe old lady exclaimed, “Ah yes! I’d forgotten. Even ill as she is, Hsi-feng thinks of everything and sends such an apt present.”\n\nAs she was speaking, the others accompanied her back.\n\nPinger told Xiren confidentially, “Our mistress says it’s an oddity — this winter plum blossoming — and if you cut off a piece of red silk to hang on it, that should bring good luck. So don’t keep talking about it as if it were something strange.”\n\nXiren nodded agreement and saw her out.\n\nNow that day Baoyu was resting at home in a fur-lined gown. When he heard about the blossom he went out to look at it, admiring it, exclaiming over it and loving it, projecting on to it all the grief, joy, separation and union in his heart. Upon hearing the sudden announcement that the Lady Dowager was coming, he changed into a fox-fur jacket with archer’s sleeves and a coat of black fox fur, then went out to welcome her. In his haste he had not put on his Magic Jade. And after the old lady had left, changing back he forgot to put it on again.\n\nNoticing its absence from his neck, Xiren asked, “Where is your jade?”\n\n“Just now when I changed in a hurry I took it off and put it on the couch table. I didn’t put it on again.”\n\nShe looked but could not see it on the table, and a search high and low revealed no trace of it. This gave her such a fright that she broke out in a cold sweat.\n\n“Don’t panic,” said Baoyu. “It can’t have gone far. Ask the others if they’ve seen it.”\n\nThinking that Sheyue and the other girls might be hiding it to tease her, she said to them with a smile, “You little sluts! If you’re playing a joke, there’s a limit to this kind of fun. Where have you hidden it? If it’s really lost that will be the end of all of us!”\n\nSheyue and the others answered sternly, “What a thing to say! This is no joking matter. We’ve been careful not even to refer to it lightly, and here you’re talking such nonsense. You must be out of your mind. Think carefully — where did you put it? Don’t make false accusations.”\n\nSeeing from their manner that this was no joke, Xiren realized that the jade must really be lost. She was frantic.\n\n“Heavens!” she cried. “Where did you drop it, little ancestor?”\n\n“I remember clearly putting it on the couch table. Do search carefully for it.”\n\nNot daring to let anyone else know, Xiren and Sheyue searched high and low in secret. But after hunting for hours they had found nothing. They ransacked the place, even turning out boxes and cases, but still could not find it. They began to suspect that it had been picked up by one of the maids who had come in.\n\n“Everyone who comes here knows how precious that jade is, as precious as life itself,” said Xiren. “Who would dare pick it up? Don’t for goodness’ sake let out a word about this, but go and make inquiries. If one of the girls has found it and is playing a trick on us, kowtow to her and beg her to give it back. If one of the younger maids has stolen it, get it back from her by whatever means you can — don’t report it to the mistresses. This is no small matter. If it’s really lost, that’s even more serious than losing Master Bao himself!”\n\nAs Sheyue and Qiuwen were about to start searching elsewhere, Xiren warned them, “Don’t start by asking those who were here for the meal. If you can’t find it and stir up trouble, that will be even worse.”\n\nThey did as she said and went off to make inquiries, but no one knew anything and all were dismayed. The two girls hurried back then, aghast, to stare blankly at each other. Baoyu was speechless with consternation too, while Xiren could only sob in desperation. There was nowhere else to look, yet they dared not report the loss. The inmates of Happy Red Court were all paralysed with terror.\n\nAs they were in this daze, all those who had heard the news arrived. Tanchun ordered the gate of the Garden to be closed. She sent old nannies with two maids to search everywhere, and had it announced that whoever found the jade would be handsomely rewarded. The servants, eager to clear themselves of suspicion and tempted by this offer of a reward, searched desperately high and low, even in the latrines. But the jade seemed as small as a needle, and though they searched all day not a trace of it was found. Li Wan was frantic.\n\nAfter a moment’s reflection she said, “This is no joking matter. I’m going to make an outrageous proposal.”\n\n“What is it?” they asked.\n\n“As things are, there’s no help for it. There are no men in the Garden apart from Baoyu, only women. So I suggest that all you young ladies and the matrons should let your maids be searched — we can start with the senior maids. If nothing comes of that, we must search the matrons and the younger maids too. How about that?”\n\n“That makes good sense,” they agreed. “With such a crowd and such confusion, good and bad are mixed up together. This is the only way to clear them.”\n\nTanchun alone said nothing.\n\nThe maids, eager to clear themselves, were all in favour of this. Pinger took the lead, saying, “Start the search with me.” All the girls then opened their clothes. Li Wan searched them all in a group.\n\nTanchun said indignantly, “Are you too, sister-in-law, going to behave like these worthless creatures? If the thief has stolen it, is she likely to be carrying it on her? Besides, this is a treasure here, but to outsiders it’s a useless thing — what would they want to steal it for? I suspect this is a dirty trick.”\n\nHearing this, and noticing that Jia Huan was not present though he had been running all over the place the previous day, they all suspected him but none liked to say so.\n\n“The only one who’d play such a dirty trick is Huan,” continued Tanchun. “Send someone quietly to fetch him. You can trick him into admitting it in private, then frighten him into keeping quiet. That should settle the matter.”\n\nThey nodded.\n\nLi Wan told Pinger, “You’re the one to handle this.”\n\nPinger assented and hurried off. Soon she came back with Jia Huan. The others pretended that nothing was amiss, called for tea and had it served in the inner room. Then, making some excuse, they left Pinger alone to question him.\n\nShe asked Jia Huan with a smile, “That jade your Second Brother had — have you seen it?”\n\nAt once his face turned purple with rage. “When other people lose things, why do you come to me and cross-question me?” he blustered. “Am I a convicted thief?”\n\nHis manner so disconcerted Pinger that she did not like to press him.\n\n“I only asked,” she said soothingly, “because I was afraid you might have taken it for fun to scare them. So I asked whether you’d seen it, to help them to look for it.”\n\n“If he wore it, whether he’s seen it or not is his business. Why ask me? You all flatter him. When he gets something good you don’t ask me. When he loses something, you come and ask me!” With that he started away.\n\nNo one could very well stop him. But now Baoyu was frantic.\n\n“It’s all the fault of this wretched thing,” he cried. “I don’t want it. You needn’t make such a fuss. Once Huan’s gone, he’s bound to spread the news all over the place. That will be the limit!”\n\nXiren and the other maids wept with frustration. “Young master, if this jade is lost it doesn’t matter to you,” they lamented. “But if Their Ladyships hear of it, we shall be torn limb from limb!” They burst out sobbing.\n\nThe others, even more frantic, knew the loss could not be hushed up and started discussing what story to concoct when they reported this to the Lady Dowager.\n\n“You don’t have to concoct anything,” said Baoyu. “Just say I smashed it.”\n\n“Easy to say that, young master,” said Pinger. “But if they ask why you smashed it, the maids will be for it too. And if they ask for the broken pieces, what shall we do then?”\n\n“Otherwise, say I lost it outside.”\n\nThey thought, “That might pass. But these last couple of days you haven’t been to school or anywhere else.”\n\n“Of course I’ve been out. The day before yesterday I went to pay my\n\nHe’s gone to the Earl of Linan’s house to see an opera. Just say he lost it the other day.”\n\n“That won’t do,” objected Tanchun. “If he lost it the other day, why didn’t he report it at the time?”\n\nThey were cudgelling their brains for some plausible lie when Concubine Zhao burst in sobbing and shouting, “You’ve lost something yourselves, yet instead of looking for it you cross-examine Huan behind my back. I’ve brought him here to hand him over to you lot of boot-lickers. You can cut him to pieces if you like!” She pushed Huan forward. “You’re a thief, so confess!” she cried.\n\nThis so enraged him that he started sobbing too.\n\nJust as Li Wan was trying to calm them down, a maid announced, “Her Ladyship is here.” Hsi-jen and the others were aghast. Pao-yu hurried out to welcome his mother, and Concubine Zhao, not daring to say any more, followed.\n\nThe Lady Dowager, seeing that they all looked consternated, believed what she had just overheard.\n\n“Is the jade really lost?” she asked.\n\nWhen no one answered she went inside and sat down, then called for Hsi-jen. The latter fell on her knees, too flustered to speak, her eyes full of tears.\n\n“Get up,” said Lady Wang. “Send people at once to make a careful search. It’s no use all panicking.”\n\nHsi-jen was too choked to speak.\n\nPao-yu, afraid that she might tell the truth, put in, “This is nothing to do with Hsi-jen, madam. I lost it the other day on my way back from the Earl of Linan’s.”\n\n“Then why didn’t you look for it that evening?”\n\n“I was afraid they’d scold me, so I didn’t tell them. I sent Pei-ming out to search everywhere.”\n\n“Nonsense!” retorted his mother. “If when you change your clothes some handkerchief or pouch is missing, Hsi-jen and the others have to account for it — let alone your jade. Do you mean to say they wouldn’t ask about it?”\n\nPao-yu had no answer to this.\n\nConcubine Zhao, hearing this, gleefully chimed in, “So things lost outside are blamed on my Huan too, are they?”\n\nBefore she could say any more Lady Wang interposed, “This is no business of yours. Why make such pointless remarks?”\n\nConcubine Zhao subsided.\n\nThen Li Wan and Tanchun told Lady Wang the whole story. In her distress she shed tears.\n\n“I shall have to report this to the old lady,” she decided, “and question the people sent here by Lady Hsing.”\n\nHsi-feng, who had heard of the loss in her sick-bed and knew that Lady Wang had come, felt she had to put in an appearance. So, supported by Feng-erh, she made her way to the Garden. She arrived just as Lady Wang was leaving and greeted her softly.\n\nPao-yu and the others asked how she was.\n\n“Have you heard the news?” Lady Wang asked Hsi-feng. “This is a strange business, isn’t it? The jade has disappeared just like that, and we can’t find it anywhere. I want you to think: from the old lady’s maids down to Ping-erh, which of them is light-fingered or malicious? I mean to tell the old lady so that we can make a thorough investigation. Otherwise, this will be the death of Pao-yu!”\n\nHsi-feng replied, “Our household is so big and mixed, it’s hard to tell. As the proverb says, ‘You may know a person’s face but not his heart.’ So we can’t swear that nobody would do such a thing. But if we raise a hue and cry, everybody will hear of it. The thief, when he knows that we mean to investigate, will be afraid of dire punishment and may destroy the jade to silence us; and then what could we do? My stupid idea is to pretend that Pao-yu doesn’t want the jade and has thrown it away — it’s not all that important anyway. But we must keep it dark and not let the old lady or the master know. While we put out this story, we can send people secretly to make investigations everywhere and trick the thief into producing it. Then we can get the jade back and fix the guilt. I wonder what you think, madam, of this plan?”\n\nLady Wang was silent.\n\nFor a while she said nothing, then at last observed, “There’s truth in what you say, but how can we hide this from His Lordship?” She sent for Jia Huan and scolded him: “Your Second Brother has lost his jade, and when you were asked in passing whether you’d seen it, why did you spread the news around? If this gets out and someone destroys it, you’ll pay for it with your life!”\n\nJia Huan, scared, sobbed that he would never dare to talk about it again. And Concubine Zhao dared not say a word either.\n\nLady Wang ordered the servants, “There must be some place we haven’t searched. How could it fly out of the house when it was here all right? But no one must breathe a word about this. I’m giving Xiren three days to find it. If it’s not found by then, we shan’t be able to hush it up and none of us will have any peace!” She told Xifeng to go with her to Lady Xing to discuss ways to track it down.\n\nLi Wan and the others talked it over, then sent for the women in charge of the Garden and ordered them to lock the Garden gate. They sent quickly for Lin Zhixiao’s wife and told her quietly, “Get the gatemen to lock the front and back gates. For the next three days, the maids and matrons inside can move about but on no account are any of them to be let out. Just say that something has been lost, and no one will be allowed to leave until it’s found.”\n\n“Yes, madam,” replied Mrs. Lin. “The other day, we lost something not too important at home, but Lin Zhixiao insisted on finding out where it was. He went to the market to consult a fortune-teller called Liu the Iron Mouth, who told him so clearly what character to write that when he came back and looked accordingly, he found it.”\n\nAt this, Xiren begged her, “Please, good Mrs. Lin, ask your husband to go and consult this man for us.”\n\nMrs. Lin agreed to this and left.\n\nXing Xiu-yan remarked, “Those fortune-tellers in the market are no good. When I was in the south I heard that Miaoyu can planchette. Why not ask her to consult the planchette? I’ve heard that this jade has some magic properties, so I think she should be able to find out.”\n\nThe others were surprised. “We often see her, but she’s never mentioned that.”\n\nSheyue urged Xiu-yan, “I don’t suppose she’d do it if others asked her, dear young lady. Let me kowtow to you — do please go and ask her! If she finds it, I shall never forget your kindness.” She made as if to kowtow, but Xiu-yan stopped her. Daiyu and the others also urged her to go to Green Lattice Nunnery.\n\nJust then, however, Lin Zhixiao’s wife came back.\n\n“I’ve good news for you, young ladies!” she announced. “My husband has consulted the fortune-teller, who says the jade isn’t really lost: it’ll be returned by someone.”\n\nThey were only half convinced by this, but Xiren and Sheyue were overjoyed.\n\n“What character did he write?” Tanchun asked.\n\n“He had a lot to say, but I can’t remember it all,” answered Mrs. Lin. “He chose the character shang ‘reward.’ Without being told, Liu the Iron Mouth said, ‘You’ve lost something, haven’t you?’”\n\n“That’s good,” said Li Wan.\n\n“He said, shang is made up of ‘small’ above and ‘mouth’ below, so this thing can be put in the mouth — it must be a pearl or jewel.”\n\n“He’s a real immortal!” they exclaimed. “What else?”\n\n“He said, ‘If you take apart the “shell” below, it makes the word “to see,” but isn’t it “not to be seen”? As the top is the character for “pawn,” you should look for it in a pawnshop. If you add the character for “man” to shang that makes shang “to repay,” so if you find the pawnshop you’ll find the man, and the man will redeem it.’”\n\n“...and so it must have been returned to him, mustn’t it?” said the others. “In that case, let’s start by searching the neighbourhood. We’ve looked in all the pawnshops anyway, so we’re bound to find it soon. Once we have it, it will be easy to get people to talk.”\n\n“All that matters is getting it back,” said Li Wan. “It doesn’t matter if we can’t get them to talk. Sister-in-law Lin, go and tell Madam Zhu and Lady Wang what the fortune-teller said so that Her Ladyship can stop worrying. And ask Madam Zhu to send someone to make inquiries right away.”\n\nLin’s wife assented and left.\n\nThe others, slightly calmer, waited anxiously for Xiu-yan’s return. As they were waiting, Pei-ming, Bao-yu’s page, appeared at the inner gate and beckoned to one of the maids, who hurried out to him.\n\n“Go in and tell Master Bao and the ladies,” he said, “I have wonderful news!”\n\n“Out with it then,” said the maid. “Why must you be so mysterious?”\n\nPei-ming clapped his hands.\n\n“When you tell them and they report it, we’ll both get a reward! What do you think it is? I’ve found out for sure what’s happened to Master Bao’s jade!”\n\nBut to know what followed, you must read the next chapter."
