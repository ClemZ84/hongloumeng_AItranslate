  "original": "话说贾琏起身去后，偏值平安节度巡边在外，约一个月方回，贾琏未得确信，只得住在下处等候。及至回来相见，将事办妥，回程已是将近两个月的限了。\n　　谁知凤姐早已心下算定，只得贾琏前脚走了，回来便传各色匠役，收拾东厢房三间，照依自己正室一样，装饰陈设。至十四日，便回明贾母王夫人，说十五日一早要到姑子庙进香去。只带了平儿、丰儿、周瑞媳妇、旺儿媳妇四人。未曾上车，便将原故告诉了众人，又吩咐众男人，素衣素盖，一径前来。兴儿引路，一直到了门前扣门。鲍二家的开了，兴儿笑道：“快回二奶奶去，大奶奶来了。”鲍二家的听了这句，顶梁骨走了真魂，忙飞跑进去报与尤二姐。尤二姐虽也一惊，但已来了，只得以礼相见，于是忙整理衣裳，迎了出来。至门前，凤姐方下了车进来，二姐一看，只见头上都是素白银器，身上月白缎子袄，青缎子掐银线的褂子，白绫素裙；眉弯柳叶，高吊两梢，目横丹凤，神凝三角：俏丽若三春之桃，清素若九秋之菊。周瑞旺儿的二女人搀进院来。二姐陪笑，忙迎上来拜见，张口便叫“姐姐”，说：“今儿实在不知姐姐下降，不曾远接，求姐姐宽恕！”说着便拜下去。凤姐忙陪笑还礼不迭，赶着拉了二姐儿的手，同入房中。\n　　凤姐在上坐，二姐忙命丫头拿褥子，便行礼，说：“妹子年轻，一从到了这里，诸事都是家母和家姐商议主张。今儿有幸相会，若姐姐不弃寒微，凡事求姐姐的指教，情愿倾心吐胆，只伏侍姐姐。”说着便行下礼去。凤姐忙下坐还礼，口内忙说：“皆因我也年轻，向来总是妇人的见识，一味的只劝二爷保重，别在外边眠花宿柳，恐怕叫太爷太太耽心：这都是你我的痴心，谁知二爷倒错会了我的意。若是外头包占人家姐妹，瞒着家里也罢了；如今娶了妹妹作二房，这样正经大事，也是人家大礼，却不曾合我说。我也劝过二爷，早办这件事，果然生个一男半女，连我后来都有靠。不想二爷反以我为那等妒忌不堪的人，私自办了，真真叫我有冤没处诉！我的这个心，惟有天地可表。头十天头里，我就风闻着知道了，只怕二爷又错想了，遂不敢先说，目今可巧二爷走了，所以我亲自过来拜见。还求妹妹体谅我的苦心，起动大驾，挪到家中。你我姐妹同居同处，彼此合心合意的谏劝二爷，谨慎世务，保养身子，这才是大礼呢。要是妹妹在外头，我在里头，妹妹白想想，我心里怎么过的去呢？再者叫外人听着，不但我的名声不好听，就是妹妹的名儿也不雅。况且二爷的名声更是要紧的，倒是谈论咱们姐儿们还是小事。至于那起下人小人之言，未免见我素昔持家太严，背地里加减些话，也是常情。妹妹想：自古说的：‘当家人，恶水缸。’我要真有不容人的地方儿，上头三层公婆，当中有好几位姐姐、妹妹、妯娌们，怎么容的我到今儿？就是今儿二爷私娶妹妹，在外头住着，我自然不愿意见妹妹，我如何还肯来呢？拿着我们平儿说起，我还劝着二爷收他呢。这都是天地神佛不忍的叫这些小人们遭塌我，所以才叫我知道了。我如今来求妹妹，进去和我一块儿，住的、使的、穿的、带的，总是一样儿的。妹妹这样伶透人，要肯真心帮我，我也得个膀臂。不但那起小人堵了他们的嘴，就是二爷回来一见，他也从今后悔，我并不是那种吃醋调歪的人，你我三人，更加和气。所以妹妹还是我的大恩人呢。要是妹妹不合我去，我也愿意搬出来陪着妹妹住，只求妹妹在二爷跟前替我好言方便方便，留我个站脚的地方儿，就叫我伏侍妹妹梳头洗脸，我也是愿意的！”说着，便呜呜咽咽，哭将起来了。\n　　二姐见了这般，也不免滴下泪来。二人对见了礼，分序坐下。平儿忙也上来要见礼。二姐见他打扮不凡，举止品貌不俗，料定必是平儿，连忙亲身搀住，只叫：“妹子快别这么着，你我是一样的人。”凤姐忙也起身笑说：“折死了他！妹妹只管受礼，他原来是咱们的丫头。以后快别这么着。”，又命周瑞家的从包袱里取出四匹上色尺头，四对金珠簪环，为拜见的礼。二姐忙拜受了。二人吃茶，对诉已往之事。凤姐口内全是自怨自错：“怨不得别人。如今只求妹妹疼我。”二姐是个实心人，便认做他是个好人，想道：“小人不遂心，诽谤主子，也是常理。”故倾心吐胆，叙了一回，竟把凤姐认为知己。又见周瑞家等媳妇在傍边称扬凤姐素日许多善政，“只是吃亏心太痴了，反惹人怨。”又说：“已经预备了房屋，奶奶进去，一看便知。”尤氏心中早已要进去同住方好，今又见如此，岂有不允之理？便说：“原该跟了姐姐去，只是这里怎么着呢？”凤姐道：“这有何难？妹妹的箱笼细软，只管着小厮搬了进去。这些粗夯货，要他无用，还叫人看着。妹妹说谁妥当，就叫谁在这里。”二姐忙说：“今儿既遇见姐姐，这一进去，凡事只凭姐姐料理。我也来的日子浅，也不曾当过家事，不明白，如何敢作主呢？这几件箱柜拿进去罢。我也没有什么东西，那也不过是二爷的。”凤姐听了，便命周瑞家的记清，好生看管着，抬到东厢房去。于是催着尤二姐急忙穿戴了，二人携手上车，又同坐一处，又悄悄的告诉他：“我们家的规矩大。这事老太太、太太一概不知；倘或知道，二爷孝中娶你，管把他打死了。如今且别见老太太、太太。我们有一个花园子极大，姐妹们住着，容易没人去的。你这一去，且在园子里住两天，等我设个法子，回明白了，那时再见方妥。”二姐道：“任凭姐姐裁处。”那些跟车的小厮们皆是预先说明的，如今不进大门，只奔后门来。下了车赶散众人，凤姐便带了尤氏，进了大观园的后门，来到李纨处相见了。\n　　彼时大观园里的十停人已有九停人知道了。今忽见凤姐带了进来，引动众人来看问。二姐一一见过。众人见了他标致和悦，无不称扬。凤姐一一的吩咐了众人：“都不许在外走了风声。若老太太、太太知道，我先叫你们死！”园里的婆子丫头都素惧凤姐的，又系贾琏国孝家孝中所行之事，知道关系非常，都不管这事。凤姐悄悄的求李纨收养几天：“等回明了，我们自然过去。”李纨见凤姐那边已收拾房屋，况在服中不好倡扬，自是正理，只得收下权住。凤姐又便去将他的丫头一概退出，又将自己的一个丫头送他使唤，暗暗吩咐他园里的媳妇们：“好生照看着他。若是走失逃亡，一概和你们算账。”自己又去暗中行事不提。\n　　且说合家之人都暗暗的纳罕，说：“看他如何这等贤惠起来了？”那二姐得了这个所在，又见园里姐妹个个好，倒也安心乐业的，自为得所。谁知三日之后，丫头善姐便有些不服使唤起来。二姐因说：“没了头油了，你去回一声大奶奶，拿些个来。”善姐儿便道：“二奶奶：你怎么不知好歹，没眼色？我们奶奶天天承应了老太太，又要承应这边太太、那边太太。这些姑娘妯娌们，上下几百男女人，天天起来都等他的话，一日少说大事也有一二十件，小事还有三五十件。外头从娘娘算起，以及王公侯伯家，多少人情；家里又有这些亲友的调度；银子上千钱上万，一天都从他一个人手里出入，一个嘴里调度；那里为这点子小事去烦琐他？我劝你能着些儿罢！咱们又不是明媒正娶来的。这是他亘古少有一个贤良人，才这样待你。若差些儿的人，听见了这活，吵嚷起来，把你丢在外头，死不死活不活，你敢怎么着呢？”一席话说的尤氏垂了头。自为有这一说，少不得将就些罢了。那善姐渐渐的连饭也怕端来给他吃了，或早一顿，晚一顿，所拿来的东西皆是剩的。二姐说过两次，他反瞪着眼叫唤起来了。二姐又怕人笑他不安本分，少不得忍着。隔上五日八日见凤姐一面，那凤姐却是和容悦色，满嘴里“好妹妹”不离口。又说：“倘有下人不到之处，你降不住他们，只管告诉我，我打他们。”又骂丫头媳妇说：“我深知你们软的欺，硬的怕，背着我的眼，还怕谁？倘或二奶奶告诉我一个‘不’字，我要你们的命。”二姐见他这般好心，“既有他，我又何必多事？下人不知好歹是常情。我要告了他们，受了委屈，反叫人说我不贤良。”因此，反替他们遮掩。\n　　凤姐一面使旺儿在外打听这二姐的底细，皆已深知：果然已有了婆家的，女婿现在才十九岁，成日在外赌博，不理世业，家私花尽了，父母撵他出来，现在赌钱场存身。父亲得了尤婆子二十两银子，退了亲的，这女婿尚不知道。原来这小伙子名叫张华。凤姐都一一尽知原委，便封了二十两银子给旺儿，悄悄命他将张华勾来养活，“着他写一张状子，只要往有司衙门里告去，就告琏二爷国孝家孝的里头，背旨瞒亲，仗财依势，强逼退亲，停妻再娶。”这张华也深知利害，先不敢造次。旺儿回了凤姐。凤姐气的骂道：“真是他娘的话！怨不得俗语说，‘癞狗扶不上墙的’。你细细说给他：就告我们家谋反也没要紧！不过是借他一闹，大家没脸；要闹大了，我这里自然能够平服的。”旺儿领命，只得细说与张华。凤姐又吩咐旺儿：“他若告了你，你就和他对词去”，如此如此，“我自有道理。”旺儿听了有他作主，便又命张华状子上添上自己，说：“你只告我来旺的过付，一应调唆二爷做的。”张华便得了主意，和旺儿商议定了。写一张状子，次日便往都察院处喊了冤。\n　　察院坐堂，看状子是告贾琏的事，上面有“家人来旺一人”，只得遣人去贾府传来旺儿来对词。青衣不敢擅入，只命人带信。那旺儿正等着此事，不用人带信，早在这条街上等候，见了青衣，反迎上去，笑道：“起动众位弟兄，必是兄弟的事犯了。说不得，快来套上。”众青衣不敢，只说：“好哥哥你去罢，别闹了。”于是来至堂前跪了。察院命将状子给他看。旺儿故意看了一遍，碰头说道：“这事小的尽知的，主人实有此事。但这张华素与小的有仇，故意拉小的在内，其中还有人，求老爷再问。”张华碰头道：“虽还有人，小的不敢告他，所以只告他下人。”旺儿故意的说：“糊涂东西，还不快说出来！这是朝廷公堂上，凭是主子，也要说出来。”张华便说出贾蓉来。察院听了无法，只得去传贾蓉。凤姐又差了庆儿暗中打听告下来了，便忙将王信唤来，告诉他此事，命他托察院，只要虚张声势，惊唬而已。又拿了三百银子给他去打点。是夜，王信到了察院私宅，安了根子。那察院深知原委，收了赃银，次日回堂，只说张华无赖，因拖欠了贾府银两，妄捏虚词，诬赖良人。都察院素与王子腾相好，王信也只到家说了一声，况是贾府之人，巴不得了事，便也不提此事，且都收下，只传贾蓉对词。\n　　且说贾蓉等正忙着贾琏之事，忽有人来报信，说：“有人告你们如此如此，这般这般，快作道理！”贾蓉慌忙来回贾珍。贾珍说：“我却早防着这一着。倒难为他这么大胆子。”立刻封了二百银子，着人去打点察院，又命家人去对词。正商议间，又报：“西府二奶奶来了。”贾珍听了这话，倒吃了一惊，忙要和贾蓉藏躲，不想凤姐已经进来了，说“好大哥哥，带着兄弟们干的好事！”贾蓉忙请安。凤姐拉了他就进来。贾珍还笑说：“好生伺候你婶娘，吩咐他们杀牲口备饭。”说着，便命备马，躲往别处去了。\n　　这里凤姐带着贾蓉，走进上屋。尤氏也迎出来了，见凤姐气色不善，忙说：“什么事情，这么忙？”凤姐照脸一口唾沫，啐道：“你尤家的丫头没人要了，偷着只往贾家送，难道贾家的人都是好的，普天下死绝了男人了？你就愿意给，也要三媒六证，大家说明，成个体统才是。你痰迷了心，脂油蒙了窍，国孝家孝两层在身，就把个人送了来。这会子叫人告我们，连官场中都知道我利害，吃醋。如今指名提我，要休我。我到了这里，干错了什么不是，你这么利害？或是老太太、太太有了话在你心里，叫你们做这个圈套挤出我去？如今咱们两个一同去见官，分证明白，回来咱们公同请了合族中人，大家觌面说个明白，给我休书，我就走！”一面说，一面大哭，拉着尤氏只要去见官。急的贾蓉跪在地下碰头，只求：“婶娘息怒！”凤姐一面又骂贾蓉：“天打雷劈、五鬼分尸的没良心的东西！不知天有多高，地有多厚，成日家调三窝四，干出这些没脸面、没王法、败家破业的营生。你死了的娘，阴灵儿也不容你，祖宗也不容你！还敢来劝我！”一面骂着，扬手就打。唬的贾蓉忙碰头说道：“婶娘别动气。只求婶娘别看这一时，侄儿千日的不好，还有一日的好。实在婶娘气不平，何用婶娘打，等我自己打，婶娘只别生气。”说着，就自己举手，左右开弓，自己打了顿嘴巴子。又自己问着自己说：“以后可还再顾三不顾四的不了？以后还单听叔叔的话、不听婶娘的话不了？婶娘是怎么样待你？你这么没天理没良心的！”众人又要劝，又要笑，又不敢笑。\n　　凤姐儿滚到尤氏怀里，嚎天动地，大放悲声，只说：“给你兄弟娶亲，我不恼，为什么使他违旨背亲，把混账名儿给我背着？咱们只去见官，省了捕快皂隶来拿。再者，咱们过去，只见了老太太、太太和众族人等，大家公议了，我既不贤良，又不容男人买妾，只给我一纸休书，我即刻就走！你妹妹，我也亲身接了来家，生怕老太太、太太生气，也不敢回，现在三茶六饭、金奴银婢的住在园里。我这里赶着收拾房子，和我一样的，只等老太太知道了。原说下接过来大家安分守己的，我也不提旧事了，谁知又是有了人家的！不知你们于的什么事！我一概又不知道。如今告我，我昨日急了，纵然我出去见官，也丢的是你贾家的脸，少不得偷把太太的五百两银子去打点。如今把我的人还锁在那里！”说了又哭，哭了又骂。后来又放声大哭起“祖宗爷娘”来，又要寻死撞头。把个尤氏揉搓成一个面团儿，衣服上全是眼泪鼻涕，并无别话，只骂贾蓉：“混账种子！和你老子做的好事！我当初就说使不得。”凤姐儿听说这话，哭着搬着尤氏的脸，问道：“你发昏了？你的嘴里难道有茄子塞着？不就是他们给你嚼子衔上了？为什么你不来告诉我去？你要告诉了我，这会子不平安了？怎么得惊官动府，闹到这步田地？你这会子还怨他们！自古说‘妻贤夫祸少’，‘表壮不如里壮’，你但凡是个好的，他们怎敢闹出这些事来？你又没才干，又没口齿，锯了嘴子的葫芦，就只会一味瞎小心，应贤良的名儿。”说着，啐了几口。尤氏也哭道：“何曾不是这样？你不信，问问跟的人，我何曾不劝的？也要他们听。叫我怎么样呢？怨不得妹妹生气，我只好听着罢了。”\n　　众姬妾丫头媳妇等已是黑压压跪了一地，陪笑求说：“二奶奶最圣明的。虽是我们奶奶的不是，奶奶也作践够了，当着奴才们。奶奶们素日何等的好来？如今还求奶奶给留点脸儿。”说着，捧上茶来，凤姐也摔了一回止了哭，挽头发，又喝骂贾蓉：“出去请你父亲来，我对面问他！问亲大爷的孝才五七，侄儿娶亲，这个礼，我竟不知道，我问问也好学着，日后教导你们！”贾蓉只跪着磕头，说：“这事原不与父母相于，都是侄儿一时吃了屎，调唆着叔叔做的。我父亲也并不知道。婶娘要闹起来了，侄儿也是个死！只求婶娘责罚侄儿，侄儿谨领。这官司还求婶娘料理，侄儿竟不能干这大事。婶娘是何等样人，岂不知俗语说的‘胳膊折了，在袖子里’？侄儿糊涂死了，既做了不肖的事，就和那猫儿狗儿一般，少不得还要婶娘费心费力，将外头的事压住了才好。只当婶娘有这个不孝的儿子，就惹了祸，少不得委屈还要疼他呢。”说着，又磕头不绝。凤姐儿见了贾蓉这般，心里早软了，只是碍着众人面前，又难改过口来，因叹了一口气，一面拉起来，一面拭泪向尤氏道：“嫂子也别恼我，我是年轻不知事的人，一听见有人告诉了，把我吓昏了，才这么着急的顾前不顾后了。可是蓉儿说的，‘胳膊折了在袖子里。’刚才的话，嫂子可别恼，还得嫂子在哥哥跟前替说，先把这官司按下去才好。”尤氏贾蓉一齐都说：“婶娘放心。横竖一点儿连累不着叔叔。婶娘方才说用过了五百两银子，少不得我们娘儿们打点五百两银子，给婶娘送过去，好补上，那有叫婶娘又添上亏空的理？那越发我们该死了。但还有一件：老太太、太太们跟前，婶娘还要周全方便，别提这些话才好。”\n　　凤姐又冷笑道：“你们饶压着我的头干了事，这会子反哄着我替你们周全！我就是个傻子，也傻不到如此：嫂子的兄弟，是我的什么人？嫂子既怕他绝了后，我难道不更比嫂子更怕绝后？嫂子的妹子，就合我的妹子一样，我一听见这话，连夜喜欢的连觉也睡不成，赶着传人收拾了屋子，就要接进来同住。倒是奴才小人的见识，他们倒说：‘奶奶太性急，若是我们的主意，先回了老太太、太太，看是怎么样，再收拾房子去接也不迟。’我听了这话，叫我要打要骂的，才不言语了。谁知偏不称我的意，偏偏儿的打嘴，半空里跑出一个张华来告了一状。我听见了，吓的两夜没合眼儿，又不敢声张，只得求人去打听这张华是什么人，这样大胆。打听了两日，谁知是个无赖的花子。小子们说：‘原是二奶奶许了他的。他如今急了，冻死饿死也是个死，现在有这个理他抓住，纵然死了，死的倒比冻死饿死还值些，怎么怨的他告呢？这事原是爷做的太急了：国孝一层罪，家孝一层罪，背着父母私娶一层罪，停妻再娶一层罪。俗语说，“拼着一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。”他穷疯了的人，什么事做不出来？况且他又拿着这满理，不告等请不成？’嫂子说，我就是个韩信、张良，听了这话，也把智谋吓回去了。你兄弟又不在家，又没个人商量，少不得拿钱去垫补。谁知越使钱越叫人拿住刀靶儿，越发来讹。我是‘耗子尾巴上长疮，多少脓血儿’。所以又急又气，少不得来找嫂子。”尤氏贾蓉不等说完，都说：“不必操心，自然要料理的。”贾蓉又道：“那张华不过是穷急，故舍了命才告咱们。如今想了一个法儿：竟许他些银子，只叫他应个妄告不实之罪，咱们替他打点完了官司，他出来时，再给他些银子就完了。”凤姐儿顺着嘴儿，笑道：“难为你想，怨不得你顾一不顾二的做出这些事来：原来你竟是这么个有心胸的，我往日错看了你了。若你说的这话，他暂且依了，且打出官司来，又得了银子，眼前自然了事。这些人既是无赖的小人，银子到手，三天五天一光了，他又来找事讹诈，再要叨蹬起来，咱们虽不怕，终久耽心。搁不住他说：既没毛病，为什么反给他银子？”贾蓉原是个明白人，听如此一说，便笑道：“我还有个主意：‘来是是非人，去是是非者’，这事还得我了才好。如今我竟问张华个主意，或是他定要人？或是他愿意了事，得钱再娶？他若说一定要人，少不得我去劝我二姨娘，叫他出来，还嫁他去，若说要钱，我们少不得给他些个。”凤姐儿忙道：“虽如此说，我断舍不得你姨娘出去，我也断不肯使他出去。他要出去了，咱们家的脸在那里呢？依我说，只宁可多给钱为是。”贾蓉深知凤姐儿口虽如此，心却是巴不得只要本人出来，他却做贤良人。如今怎么说，且只好怎么依着。\n　　凤姐儿又说：“外头好处了，家里终久怎么样呢？你也和我过去回明了老太太、太太才是。”尤氏又慌了，拉凤姐儿讨主意，怎么撒谎才好。凤姐冷笑道：“既没这本事，谁叫你干这样事？这会子这个腔儿，我又看不上。待要不出个主意，我又是个心慈面软的人，凭人撮弄我，我还是一片傻心肠儿，说不得等我应起来。如今你们只别露面，我只领了你妹妹去给老太太、太太们磕头。只说：原系你妹妹我看上了很好，正因我不大生长，原说买两个人放在屋里的；今既见了你妹妹很好，而且又是亲上做亲的，我愿意娶来做二房。皆因家中父母妹妹亲近一概死了，日子又难，不能度日，若等百日之后，无奈无家无业，实在难等。就算我的主意，接进来了，已经厢房收拾出来了，暂且住着，等满了孝再圆房儿。仗着我这不害臊的脸，死活赖去，有了不是，也寻不着你们了。你们娘儿两个想想，可使得？”\n　　尤氏、贾蓉一齐笑说：“到底是婶娘宽洪大量，足智多谋！等事妥了，少不得我们娘儿们过去拜谢。”凤姐儿道：“罢呀，还说什么拜谢不拜谢。”又指着贾蓉道：“今日我才知道你了。”说着，把脸却一红，眼圈儿也红了，似有多少委屈的光景。贾蓉忙陪笑道：“罢了，少不得担待我这一次罢。”说着，忙又跪下了。凤姐儿扭过脸去不理他，贾蓉才笑着起来了。这里尤氏忙命丫头们舀水，取妆奁，伏侍凤姐儿梳洗了，赶忙又命预备晚饭。凤姐儿执意要回去，尤氏拦着道：“今日二婶子要这么走了，我们什么脸还过那边去呢？”贾蓉旁边笑着劝道：“好婶娘！好婶娘！以后蓉儿要不真心孝顺你老人家，天打雷劈。”凤姐瞅了他一眼，啐道：“谁信你这……”说到这里，又咽住了。一面老婆丫头们摆上酒菜来，尤氏亲自递酒布菜。贾蓉又跪着敬了一钟酒。凤姐便合尤氏吃了饭。丫头们递了漱口茶，又捧上茶来。凤姐喝了两口，便起身回去。贾蓉亲身送过来，进门时，又悄悄的央告了几句私心话，凤姐也不理他，只得怏怏的回去了。\n    且说凤姐进园中，将此事告诉尤二姐，又说，我怎么操心，又怎么打听，须得如此如此，方保得众人无罪，“少不得咱们按着这个法儿来才好。”\n不知凤姐又想出什么计策，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Jia Lian’s departure it happened that the Pacification Commissioner of Ping An was away inspecting the frontier and would not be back for a month. So Jia Lian, having no definite date to go by, had to stay on in his lodgings to wait.\n\nNot until the commissioner’s return could he have an audience with him and complete his business. By the time he started back, nearly two months had passed.\n\nNow Xifeng had already made her plans. As soon as her husband left she had workmen come to redecorate and furnish three rooms in the east courtyard exactly like her own apartments. On the fourteenth of the month she told the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang that the next day she wanted to go at dawn to burn incense in a nunnery. She took only Ping-erh, Feng-erh, Zhou Rui’s wife and Lai Wang’s wife. Before mounting her carriage she explained her plan to her servants, and ordered the men-servants to wear plain clothes and use undecorated carriage covers.\n\nXing’er led the way to the gate of the new household and knocked. The wife of Bao Er opened up.\n\n“Go and tell your mistress, quick, that the first madam is here,” said Xing’er with a grin.\n\nThis announcement made the woman’s soul nearly fly from her body. She flew inside to report to Second Sister You. Although taken aback, Second Sister had to receive her visitor with propriety. So she straightened her clothes and went out to meet her. She found Xifeng alighting from her carriage. She was wearing a kingfisher-blue satin coat lined with white squirrel, a green satin jacket embroidered with silver, and a white silk skirt. Her eyebrows were arched like willow leaves, her eyes almond-shaped; she was as lovely as peach-blossom in spring, and as graceful as a chrysanthemum in autumn. Zhou Rui’s wife and Lai Wang’s wife helped her into the courtyard.\n\nSecond Sister stepped forward with a smile to greet her, calling her “sister.”\n\n“I had no idea that you were coming, sister, or I’d have gone out to welcome you,” she said. “Do please forgive me for not going to meet you.” With that she curtseyed.\n\nXifeng returned her smile and greeted her in turn, then took her hand and they entered the house together.\n\nXifeng took the seat of honour and Second Sister told a maid to bring a cushion. Then, having curtseyed, she said, “I’m young, sister. Since coming here everything has been decided by my mother and elder sister. I’m so lucky to be meeting you today. If you don’t look down on me for my lack of merits, I beg you to instruct me in everything. I’d like to open my heart to you and be at your service.” She curtseyed again.\n\nXifeng rose to return the courtesy.\n\n“I’m young too,” she said. “As a woman I’ve always urged my husband to take good care of himself and not to amuse himself outside with loose women, for fear that his parents should worry. That shows how silly both you and I are. But he misunderstood my good intentions. If he’d kept some singsong girls outside without telling the family, that would be one thing. But taking a second wife is a serious, respectable business, an important part of the family ceremony; yet he never breathed a word to me. I even advised him to choose a better wife, so that if she bore him a son or daughter I’d have someone to rely on in my old age. Fancy his thinking me a jealous shrew and doing this on the sly, so that I’ve no way to clear myself! No one but Heaven above and Earth below knows how I feel.\n\n“I heard this news some ten days ago, and was afraid people might gossip, so I didn’t like to speak of it rashly; but now that he’s away, I’ve come to call on you. I beg you, sister, to understand my good intentions and move into our house. Then we can live together as sisters and with one heart do all we can to advise our husband to attend to business and look after his health. That’s the right thing. If you stay outside while I’m at home, just think how bad I shall feel. Besides, if outsiders hear of this it will reflect badly not just on me but on you as well, and even more on our husband. For us to be criticized is a small matter; but if those low servants start gossiping, they’re bound to say....”\n\nIt’s only natural, when a house is too strictly run, for servants to make trouble behind one’s back by tittle-tattling. You must know the proverb, dearest sister: A person in charge has to be a dustbin. If I were really so impossible to get on with, with three layers of superiors above me and so many sisters-in-law and cousins all around, how could I have held my own up to now? And if I really disapproved of your marriage to my husband, and your staying outside, of course I shouldn’t have wanted to see you — why then would I have come to call on you? I’ve even urged him to take Pinger as his concubine. The gods must have been so incensed by the way those slaves have been maligning me that they made me find out the truth. I’ve come today to beg you to move in with me. Then we can share the same accommodation, the same allowances, the same clothes and trinkets. If you’re willing to help me sincerely, as a smart girl like you can, you’ll be like a second self to me. That will not only silence those scoundrels but make my husband, when he comes back and sees us, repent of the way he’s treated me. He’ll see that I’m not the jealous, shrewish sort. The three of us will live together in perfect harmony. So you see, you’d really be doing me a great favour. If you won’t move in with me, I’m willing to move out here to keep you company. I only beg you to put in a good word for me to my husband, so that he’ll let me stay on here. I’d be glad even to act as your maid and dress your hair for you!”\n\nShe broke off and burst out sobbing.\n\nSecond Sister could not hold back her tears either. They exchanged courtesies then sat down in the places of guest and host, while Pinger stepped forward to pay her respects. Impressed by her dress, bearing and appearance, Second Sister knew this must be Pinger and hastily raised her up with her own hands.\n\n“Don’t do that, sister,” she cried. “You and I are the same.”\n\nXifeng rose with a smile.\n\n“Don’t kill her with kindness,” she said. “Let her pay her respects to you; she’s only our maid. You mustn’t do that in future.” She told Zhou Rui’s wife to unpack four rolls of the best silk and four pairs of gold and pearl trinkets from the bundle to present as gifts. Second Sister accepted them with thanks.\n\nThen, as they drank tea, they chatted about the past. Xifeng took all the blame on herself.\n\n“No one else is at fault,” she said. “I just hope you’ll be good to me now.”\n\nA simple-hearted woman, Second Sister took her for a good person.\n\n“It’s only natural for servants to slander their masters when they can’t get their own way,” she thought. And she poured out all her feelings to Xifeng, looking on her now as a sister. When Zhou Rui’s wife and the other matrons chimed in with praises of their mistress’ many kindnesses — her only fault being that she was too soft, which made some people accuse her of harshness — and told Second Sister, “The rooms are all ready for you, madam. If you move in, you’ll see for yourself,” she had already made up her mind to do so.\n\n“Of course I’ll go with you, sister,” she said. “But what’s to be done about this place?”\n\n“That’s no problem,” replied Xifeng. “Just tell your servants to move your cases and valuables inside. There’s no need to take all this coarse furniture; it can stay here under the care of one of your men. You can choose someone reliable to leave in charge.”\n\nSecond Sister said, “Now that I’ve met you, sister, and am moving in with you, I’ll leave everything to you. I haven’t been here long and have no experience of household management — I wouldn’t dare make decisions. Let these cases and cabinets be moved inside. I’ve few personal belongings, and such as I have were all given me by your husband.”\n\nXifeng ordered Zhou Rui’s wife to note carefully what was to be taken and have it carried to the east side-room, taking good care of it. She then urged Second Sister to dress quickly, and hand in hand they got into the carriage and sat close together. Xifeng quietly warned her:\n\n“Our family rules are very strict. The old lady and madam know nothing about this yet. If they found out that he’d married you while in mourning, they’d have him beaten to death. So don’t\n\n\"Don't see Their Ladyships yet. We have a very big garden where the girls live and it's not easy for anyone to get at you. You go and stay in the Garden for a couple of days while I think of some way to break the news to them; then it will be all right for you to see them.\"\n\n\"Whatever you think best, sister,\" said Second Sister.\n\nThe servants escorting the carriage had been told what to do in advance. Instead of going to the main gate, they made straight for the back gate. When Second Sister had alighted, Xifeng dismissed the crowd and led her through the back gate of Grand View Garden to Li Wan's apartments.\n\nBy this time, ninety per cent of the inmates of the Garden had heard the news. They flocked to see Xifeng bring in her new acquisition, and Second Sister was introduced to them one by one. Struck by her good looks and pleasant manner, they were loud in their praise.\n\nXifeng warned them all, \"Not a word about this outside! If the old lady and Lady Wang get to hear of it, I'll have you all killed!\" The matrons and maids in the Garden had always been afraid of Xifeng, and knowing too that since this concerned Jia Lian it was a serious matter during the national and family mourning, they dared not breathe a word about it.\n\nXifeng urged Li Wan in private to take Second Sister in for a few days. \"Once Their Ladyships have been told, we'll move her out,\" she promised. Li Wan, knowing that Xifeng had had rooms prepared and that it was inadvisable to make this public during the period of mourning, had to agree to let her stay there for the time being. Xifeng sent away all Second Sister's maids, giving her one of her own instead, and secretly ordered the matrons in the Garden: \"Take good care of her. If she gets away, you'll have to answer for it.\" Then she set to work in secret on her own plan.\n\nAll the inmates of the Rong Mansion were amazed by Xifeng's behaviour. \"How did she suddenly grow so virtuous?\" they wondered.\n\nAs for Second Sister, finding the Garden a pleasant place to stay and all the girls so friendly, she settled down there happily, feeling she had fallen on her feet. But three days later, her maid Shanjie began answering back and refusing to wait on her.\n\n\"I've run out of hair oil,\" Second Sister told her. \"Will you ask the mistress for some?\"\n\n\"How can you be so inconsiderate and dense, madam?\" snapped Shanjie. \"Every day our mistress has to wait on the old lady and Her Ladyship on this side as well as the other. There are all the young ladies and mistresses too. Several hundred people, high and low, in the household wait every day for her instructions. She has to see to at least twenty important matters a day, and any number of small ones. Outside, there are all the social obligations to the Imperial Consort and the families of princes, marquises and earls; and at home, the demands of all our relatives and friends. Thousands and thousands of taels pass through her hands every day, all the decisions are taken by her alone. How can we bother her with such trifles? My advice to you, madam, is to take things as they come. It's not as if you were married to our master with proper ceremonies. It's only because she's so kind and good — there's not another like her — that she's treating you so well. If she were at all different and got to hear the way you're carrying on, she could turn you out to die like a dog in the gutter, and what could you do about it?\"\n\nThis reduced Second Sister to silence. Since she had come here on these terms, she had to put up with it. Soon Shanjie even grudged bringing her meals, sometimes serving them early and sometimes late, and the food was always left-overs. When Second Sister remonstrated a couple of times, the maid flared up.\n\nSecond Sister was afraid the others might laugh at her for not knowing her place, so she had to put up with this ill treatment. Every five or eight days, when she saw Xifeng, the latter was all smiles and called her \"dear sister.\" She would say:\n\n\"If the servants don't look after you properly or you find them too much for you, just let me know and I'll have them beaten.\" She also scolded the maids and matrons, \"I know you — you only bully the meek and fear the tough. You're not afraid of anyone behind my back. If Mrs. Lian from the other house complains to me, I'll...\"\n\n“I’ll kill you all!” Since Second Sister was so good-natured, she thought: “With her to protect them, why should I make trouble? It’s only natural that servants should be grasping. If I report them and they’re punished, people may call me unjust.” So she covered up for them.\n\nXifeng meanwhile had sent Lai Wang to make inquiries about Second Sister’s antecedents, and he had found out everything. She was indeed engaged. Her fiance, a nineteen-year-old called Zhang Hua, was a compulsive gambler who had squandered all his property so that his parents had turned him out and he was now living in a gambling den. His father had accepted twenty taels from old Mrs. You to break off the engagement, but the young man did not yet know this.\n\nXifeng, having ascertained all the facts, gave Lai Wang twenty taels to quietly lure Zhang Hua into staying with him.\n\n“Tell him to write a plaint and take it to the court,” she ordered. “He is to accuse Lian the Second of infringing the national law against marriage during the period of state and family mourning, and of overriding his parents’ wishes to rely on his wealth and power in forcing a breach of engagement and taking another wife during his first wife’s lifetime.”\n\nZhang Hua at first was afraid to make such an accusation, and Lai Wang reported this to Xifeng.\n\n“The son of a bitch!” she swore. “No wonder they say a mangy dog can’t be helped over a wall. Go and tell him in detail that he can even accuse us of treason, for all I care. I just want him to make a scene so that everyone loses face. If he makes trouble, I can handle it.”\n\nLai Wang had to pass this on to Zhang Hua.\n\nXifeng also instructed Lai Wang, “If he names you in the charge, go and confront him.” She told him exactly what to do, adding, “Leave it to me.”\n\nThus reassured, Lai Wang told Zhang Hua to include his name in the plaint. “Just accuse me, Lai Wang, of being the go-between and inciting the Second Master to do this,” he said.\n\nSo Zhang Hua, taking his cue from Lai Wang, drew up a plaint and took it the next day to the Censorate, where he lodged an accusation.\n\nThe Censor presiding that day saw that the charge was against Jia Lian and that Lai Wang of his household was involved. He sent officers to the Jia mansion to summon Lai Wang. Not venturing to enter without authorization, they simply sent in a message. But Lai Wang had been waiting for this. Instead of waiting for them to summon him, he was waiting in the street and stepped forward at sight of the runners with a smile.\n\n“Sorry to put you gentlemen to trouble, brothers,” he said. “I suppose I’m for it. Come on, clap the cangue on me.”\n\nThe runners dared not do this.\n\n“Come along with us, brother, and don’t make trouble,” they demurred.\n\nHe went with them and knelt down before the court. The Censor showed him the plaint. Lai Wang read it carefully and kowtowed.\n\n“I know all about this, Your Honour,” he said. “It’s true. But this Zhang Hua has a grudge against me and has dragged me into it. There are others involved too. I beg Your Honour to question him further.”\n\nZhang Hua kowtowed. “There are others, but I don’t dare accuse them. That’s why I’ve only accused his servant.”\n\n“You fool!” cried Lai Wang deliberately. “Out with it! This is a court of justice. You must speak out, even if one of your masters is involved.”\n\nThen Zhang Hna named Jia Rong.\n\nThe Censor, much against his will, had to send runners to summon Jia Rong.\n\nAs soon as Xifeng heard, through Qing’er whom she had sent to find out, that the charge had been accepted, she sent for Wang Xin and told him what had happened. She instructed him to bribe the Censor simply to put on a show to frighten certain people, and gave him three hundred taels to use as bribes. That evening Wang Xin called on the Censor at his private residence and secured his cooperation.\n\nThe Censor, who knew the whole story, accepted this bribe. The next day when he opened court he declared that Zhang Hua was a rogue who, being in debt to the Jia family, had brought a false charge against good people. The Censor, a friend of Wang Ziteng, had agreed as soon as Wang Xin spoke to him. And as those accused belonged to the Jia family, he was only too glad to drop the case. He accepted the plaint and simply summoned Jia Rong to confront the accuser.\n\nLet us return to Jia Rong, who was busy with Jia Lian’s affairs, when a messenger arrived to warn him:\n\n“A charge has been brought against you of such and such a kind. Quick, think of a way out!”\n\nJia Rong in a panic went to report this to Jia Zhen.\n\n“I foresaw this,” said Jia Zhen. “But I must say, the fellow has a nerve.”\n\nHe at once wrapped up two hundred taels and sent a servant to bribe the court, also ordering one of his men to go and testify. While they were conferring, another servant announced, “Madam Lian from the West Mansion has come.”\n\nThis news gave Jia Zhen quite a fright. He wanted to hide himself and Jia Rong, but before they could do so Xifeng swept in.\n\n“A fine way to behave, elder brother, leading the younger ones astray!” she cried.\n\nJia Rong promptly paid his respects, and Xifeng caught hold of him to drag him inside.\n\n“Look after your aunt well,” said Jia Zhen with a smile. “Tell them to kill some fowl or sheep and prepare a meal for her.” He then ordered his horse to be saddled and made off.\n\nXifeng, holding on to Jia Rong, entered the main room. Madam You came out to meet her and, seeing how angry Xifeng looked, asked:\n\n“What’s happened to bring you here in such a state?”\n\nXifeng spat in her face.\n\n“Are the girls of your You family such nobody wants them that you have to palm them off on the Jias in this underhand way?” she shrieked. “Is every single one of the Jia men a good catch? Have all the other men in the world died out? Even if you were willing to give her to us, you should have done it in the proper way with go-betweens and witnesses, so that everybody knew. But you must have been bewitched, your heart stuffed with lard, to send her here secretly while we’re in mourning — both national and family mourning. Now a charge has been brought and even the court knows how jealous and shrewish I am. They’ve named me and want me repudiated. What have I done wrong to be treated so viciously? Or is this a plot you’ve hatched on the instructions of the old lady and Lady Wang to drive me out? Well, let’s go to court together and have this out. Then we can ask the whole clan to meet and thrash this business out openly. If they’ll give me a divorce, I’ll leave. But I’m not going to put up with this.”\n\nShe burst out sobbing, then tugged at Madam You, insisting that they must go to court at once. In desperation Jia Rong kotowed to her, entreating her to calm down.\n\n“Heaven strike you dead, you heartless monster!” Xifeng swore at him. “May you be cut to pieces by five devils! You don’t know what’s above your head or under your feet. All day long you stir up trouble, doing such shameless, lawless things to ruin your family. Your dead mother’s spirit in the other world won’t forgive you, nor will your ancestors. How dare you try to stop me!”\n\nShe struck at him, and he kotowed in alarm.\n\n“Don’t be angry, aunt,” he begged. “Don’t judge me just by this one day. Out of a thousand days a nephew may have one bad one. If you’re really angry, there’s no need for you to beat me — I’ll beat myself. Just don’t be angry.”\n\nHe raised both hands and boxed his own ears hard, then asked himself:\n\n“Will you go on muddling things like this in future? Will you just listen to your uncle and not to your aunt? How has your aunt wronged you, that you should show no sense of decency and no gratitude?”\n\nThe servants did not know whether to try to calm Xifeng down or whether they might venture to laugh.\n\nXifeng threw herself into Madam You’s arms.\n\n“Sister-in-law!“ she wailed. “I’ve only to give you my word and you do as I say.”\n\nThe servants found this hard to take, and some of them commented, “It’s always been the custom for our masters to have three or four wives or concubines. Why should Her Ladyship carry on in such a shocking way? It’s too bad that our mistress should be put in such a fix.”\n\nBut enough of this idle talk.\n\nThe maids live in the Garden, and I’m rushing to get the rooms ready so that they can move in — I’ve kept it quiet, waiting for the old lady to be told. I was going to have them move over and keep out of trouble, without bringing up the past. But now I find they’re engaged! What have you been up to behind my back? I’ve no idea. And now I’m charged.\n\nYesterday I was so frantic, even if I’d gone to court I’d only have disgraced the Jia family. So I had to steal five hundred taels of Her Ladyship’s silver to bribe the runners. But they’ve still locked up my servant. She wept and stormed, and then started wailing about her ancestors and parents, threatening to kill herself and dashing her head against the wall. She made such a scene that Madam You was reduced to a pulp, her clothes drenched with tears and鼻涕 mucus, and could only curse Jia Rong.\n\n“You degenerate! You and your father have fine ways! I always said this was wrong.”\n\nWhen Xifeng heard this she took Madam You’s face between her hands.\n\n“Are you crazy?” she sobbed. “Is your mouth stopped with eggplant? Or have they put a gag in it? Why didn’t you come and tell me? If you had, this wouldn’t have happened. We wouldn’t have had to alert the courts and make such a scandal. How can you blame them? As the proverb says, ‘A good wife keeps her husband out of trouble.’ If you’d any sense, they’d never have dared carry on like this. But you’re so stupid and inarticulate, like a sawed-off gourd, all you can do is try to win a reputation for goodness by being accommodating.” She spat in disgust.\n\n“Isn’t that the truth?” wept Madam You. “If you don’t believe me, ask my maids. I did advise them, but would they listen? What could I do? No wonder you’re angry, sister. I’ve no answer to make.”\n\nBy now the whole floor was black with kneeling maids and serving-women, who begged Xifeng with smiles to be reasonable.\n\n“You’re so wise, madam,” they said. “Our mistress may have been at fault, but you’ve punished her enough in front of us slaves. You’ve always been on such good terms. Do leave her some face.”\n\nThey offered her tea, but Xifeng threw the cup down. Having wept her fill, she smoothed her hair and rounded on Jia Rong.\n\n“Go and fetch your father,” she cried. “I want to ask him in your presence: Is it right for a nephew to marry during the filial mourning for his uncle? I’ve never heard of such a thing. I’d like to know the rule so that I can teach it to you later.”\n\nJia Rong kotowed.\n\n“My parents had nothing to do with this,” he pleaded. “It was all my fault for behaving like a swine and egging my uncle on. My father knew nothing about it. If you make an issue of this, aunt, it will be the death of me. I beg you to punish me instead. I deserve it. And I beg you to settle this court case for me. I’m too young to handle it. A clever lady like you must know the saying: ‘When the arm is broken, hide it in your sleeve.’ I’ve been a fool. Since I’ve done this wicked thing, like a stupid dog or cat I must rely on you to cover up for me and hush it up outside. Just regard me as your undutiful son. If I’ve stirred up trouble, you must make the best of it and be patient with me.” He went on kotowing.\n\nBy now Xifeng’s heart was softened, but with all those people present she could not eat her words. She sighed, helped Jia Rong up and dried her tears.\n\n“Don’t be angry with me, sister,” she said to Madam You. “I’m young and inexperienced. When someone told me, I was so scared it addled my wits. That’s why I was in such a panic and didn’t stop to think. As Rong says, ‘When the arm is broken, hide it in your sleeve.’ I hope you won’t take offence at what I said just now, sister. You must explain to your husband that we must...”\n\n\"we must hush up this lawsuit,\" they cried. \"Set your mind at rest, aunt. In any case, uncle won’t be involved. Since you say you’ve already spent five hundred taels, of course we’ll raise that sum and send it over to you to make up, for how can we let you be out of pocket? That would be downright wicked. There’s just one thing, though: we hope you’ll put in a good word for us with the old lady and Lady Wang, and not breathe a word about this to them.\"\n\nXifeng smiled sarcastically. \"You forced me into this, and now you expect me to get you out of the mess! Even if I were a fool I’m not such a fool as that. What is your brother to me? If you were afraid of his dying without son, wasn’t I even more afraid? Your cousin is the same as mine to me. The news that she was coming made me so happy I couldn’t sleep all night, and I at once ordered the servants to clear some rooms so that I could fetch her here to live with me. But the servants had their reservations. They said, ‘Don’t be in such a hurry, madam. If we had our way, you’d first tell the old lady and Lady Wang. It would be soon enough to clear rooms and fetch her here after you’d seen what they thought.’ I was so angry I threatened to beat and curse them, and that shut them up. Who could have foreseen that instead of falling in with my wishes I’d get a slap in the face? Out of the blue this Zhang Hua brought a charge against us.\n\n\"When I heard, I was so scared I couldn’t sleep for two nights, yet I dared not let anyone know. I just sent to find out who this Zhang Hua was that he should have such nerve. After a couple of days I learned that the wretch is a beggar. The servants said, ‘Of course, the Second Mistress promised him to someone else. Now that he’s desperate, and death by freezing or starvation is still death, he thinks since he has this excuse he may as well make use of it; even if he dies for it, it’s better than dying in the gutter. No wonder he’s brought a charge. Our master was too hasty. He’s committed one crime by marrying during the national mourning, another by marrying during period of family mourning, another by marrying without his parents’ consent, and another by taking a second wife while his first is still alive. As the proverb says, A man who will risk being sliced to pieces dare to unsaddle the Emperor. A man made desperate by poverty will go to any lengths. And as he’s so obviously in the right, instead of waiting to be arrested why shouldn’t he accuse us? Tell me, aunt, even if I were as crafty as Han Xin or Zhang Liang, wouldn’t such talk scare all the wits out of me? Besides, your brother’s away from home and there’s no one I can consult. I had to spend money to hush it up. But the more I spent the harder they pressed me, demanding more. I’ve only so much money — you can’t get blood out of a stone. So in desperation I’ve come to see you.\"\n\nBefore she could say more, Madam You and Jia Rong promised, \"Don’t worry. We’ll see to it.\"\n\nJia Rong added, \"That Zhang Hua is so desperate he’s risking his life to accuse us. I’ve thought of a way. We can bribe him with some silver to withdraw his charge as false accusation. Then we can pay to have the case settled, and give him some more silver when he’s released.\"\n\nXifeng pouted scornfully. \"What a bright idea! No wonder you rushed into this regardless of the consequences. So you’ve got some sense after all. I misjudged you in the past. But even if he agrees to this for the time being and withdraws the charge, and the case is settled and he gets some silver, that may be all right for the moment. But since he’s a rascal, a few days after the money’s spent he’s sure to make more trouble and demand more. Though we’ve nothing to fear, it would be a nuisance. Besides, he’s bound to say, ‘If you’d done nothing wrong, why did you bribe me?’\"\n\nJia Rong, being no fool, replied with a smile, \"I’ve another plan. ‘The one who starts the trouble should end it.’\n\n“The one who stirs up trouble must settle it,” she thought. “I’m the one to straighten this out. I’ll ask Zhang Hua what he wants: whether he insists on having his wife back, or is willing to break it off, take some money and marry another girl. If he insists on having her back, I’ll have to persuade my aunt to let Second Sister go back to him. If he’s willing to take money instead, we’ll have to give him some.”\n\n“Even so,” Xifeng put in, “I certainly can’t let your aunt go, and I won’t allow her to leave. If she went back, what would people think of our family? In my opinion, it’s better to give him more money.”\n\nJia Rong knew that though Xifeng talked this way, she was only too anxious to have the girl back so that she could pose as a virtuous wife. He had to agree to whatever she said.\n\n“Even if it’s settled outside, what about the situation at home?” she went on. “You must go with me to report this to the old lady and Lady Wang.”\n\nMadam You in consternation begged Xifeng to advise her how to cover up the truth.\n\n“If you hadn’t the nerve, why did you do such a thing?” Xifeng smiled scornfully. “I can’t stand such shilly-shallying. Still, I’m too soft-hearted to let people down and usually play the fool, so I suppose I’ll have to take this on myself. The two of you had better keep out of sight while I take your sister to pay her respects to the old lady and Lady Wang. I’ll say that I’ve taken a fancy to her and, as I’ve no son, I was thinking of buying a couple of concubines for my husband. Now that I’ve seen how attractive your sister is and we’re related too, I’d like him to take her as second wife. Because all her family are dead and she’s hard up, she can’t wait out the period of mourning, especially as she has no home and no means of support. So I’ve decided to bring her in. We’ve cleared the rooms in the compound and she can stay there for the time being, not sharing my husband’s room until the mourning is over. Shameless as I am, I’ll brazen it out. If there’s any flak, it won’t blow back on you. What do you think of this plan, both of you?”\n\n“How kind you are, aunt, and how wise!” cried Madam You and Jia Rong. “When this is settled, we must both come to thank you.”\n\n“Nonsense!” retorted Xifeng. “But this has shown me what you’re like.” She pointed at Jia Rong as she spoke, then flushed and her eyes reddened as if she were quite overcome.\n\n“Do make allowances for me just this once,” he begged with a placating smile, then fell on his knees.\n\nXifeng ignored him, turning her face away, and not until then did he get up with a smile.\n\nMadam You hastily ordered maids to bring water and a dressing-case and help Xifeng to make up. Then she told them to serve the evening meal at once. But Xifeng insisted on going back.\n\n“If you leave like this today, how can we ever look out friends and relatives in the other mansion again?” protested Madam You.\n\nJia Rong chimed in, “Do stay, dear aunt! If I don’t show true filial piety to you from now on, may thunder strike me dead!”\n\nXifeng spat in disgust. “Who believes that....” She broke off and said no more.\n\nThen servants brought in wine and dishes, and Madam You personally poured wine and served the food. Jia Rong knelt down to toast Xifeng. After the meal, which she ate with Madam You, a maid brought her tea to rinse her mouth with and then some better tea. She drank only a few sips before getting up to take her leave. Jia Rong escorted her to her carriage and, as she stepped in, softly begged a few more favours of her; but she simply ignored him and he had to walk away disconsolately.\n\nXifeng drove back to the Garden and told Second Sister the whole story.\n\n\"How am I to do the worrying and the inquiring? It must be done in such and such a way. Only then can we ensure that no one is blamed. We must certainly adopt this method.\"\n\nBut you must read the next chapter to learn what scheme Xifeng devised."
