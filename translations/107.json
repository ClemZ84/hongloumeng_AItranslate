  "original": "话说贾政进内，见了枢密院各位大臣，又见了各位王爷。北静王道：“今日我们传你来，有遵旨问你的事。”贾政急忙跪下。众大臣便问道：“你哥哥交通外官、恃强凌弱、纵儿聚赌、强占良民妻女不遂逼死的事，你都知道么？”贾政回道：“犯官自从主恩钦点学政任满后，查看赈恤，于上年冬底回家，又蒙堂派工程，后又任江西粮道，题参回都，仍在工部行走，日夜不敢怠惰。一应家务，并未留心伺察，实在糊涂。不能管教子侄，这就是辜负圣恩。只求主上重重治罪。”北静王据说转奏。不多时传出旨来，北静王便述道：“主上因御史参奏贾赦交通外官，恃强凌弱，据该御史指出平安州互相往来，贾赦包揽词讼，严鞫贾赦，据供平安州原姻亲来往，并未干涉官事，该御史亦不能指实。惟有倚势强索石呆子古扇一款是实的，然系玩物，究非强索良民之物可比。虽石呆子自尽，亦系疯傻所致，与逼勒致死者有间。今从宽将贾赦发往台站效力赎罪。所参贾珍强占良民妻女为妾不从逼死一款。提取都察院原委，看得尤二姐实系张华指腹为婚未娶之妻，因伊贫苫自愿退婚，尤二姐之母愿结贾珍之弟为妻，并非强占。再尤三姐自刎掩埋、并未报官一款，查尤三姐原系贾珍妻妹，本意为伊择配，因被逼索定礼，众人扬言秽乱，以致羞忿自尽，并非贾珍逼勒致死。但身系世袭职员，罔知法纪，私埋人命，本应重治，念伊究属功臣后裔，不忍加罪，亦从宽革去世职，派往海疆效力赎罪。贾蓉年幼无干，省释。贾政实在外任多年，居官尚属勤慎，免治伊治家不正之罪。”\n　　贾政听了，感激涕零，叩首不及，又叩求王爷代奏下忱。北静王道：“你该叩谢天恩，更有何奏？”贾政道：“犯官仰蒙圣恩，不加大罪，又蒙将家产给还，实在扪心惶懊。愿将祖宗遗受重禄，积馀置产，一并交官。”北静王道：“主上仁慈待下，明慎用刑，赏罚无差，如今既蒙莫大深恩，给还财产，你又何必多此一奏？”众官也说不必。贾政便谢了恩，叩谢了王爷出来，恐贾母不放心，急忙赶回。上下男女人等不知传进贾政是何吉凶，都在外头打听，一见贾政回家，都略略的放心，也不敢问。\n　　只见贾政忙忙的走到贾母跟前，将蒙圣恩宽免的事细细告诉了一遍。贾母虽则放心，只是两个世职革去，贾赦又往台站效力，贾珍又往海疆，不免又悲伤起来。邢夫人、尤氏听见这话，更哭起来。贾政便道：“老太太放心。大哥虽则台站效力，也是为国家办事，不致受苦，只要办得妥当，就可复职。珍儿正是年轻，很该出力。若不是这样，便是祖父的馀德亦不能久享。”说了些宠慰的括。贾母素来本不大喜欢贾赦，那边东府贾珍究竟隔了一层，只有邢夫人、尤氏痛哭不止。邢夫人想着：“家产一空，丈夫年老远出，膝下虽有琏儿，又是素来顺他二叔的，如今都靠着二叔，他两口子自然更顺着那边去了。独我一人孤苦伶仃，怎么好？”那尤氏本来独掌宁府的家计，除了贾珍，也算是惟他为尊，又与贾珍夫妻相和；如今犯事远出，家财抄尽，依往荣府，虽则老太太疼爱，终是依人门下。又兼带着佩凤、偕鸾，那蓉儿夫妇也还不能兴家立业。又想起：“二妹妹、三妹妹都是琏二爷闹的，如今他们倒安然无事，依旧夫妻完聚，只剩我们几个，怎么度日？”想到这里，痛哭起来。贾母不忍，便问贾政道：“你大哥和珍儿现已定案，可能回家？蓉儿既没他的事，也该放出来了。”贾政道：“若在定例呢，大哥是不能回家的。我已托人徇个私情，叫我大哥同着侄儿回家，好置办行装，衙门内业已应了。想来蓉儿同着他爷爷父亲一起出来。只请老太太放心，儿子办去。”\n　　贾母又道：“我这几年老的不成人了，总没有问过家事。如今东府里是抄了去了，房子入官不用说；你大哥那边，琏儿那里，也都抄了。咱们西府里的银库和东省地土，你知道还剩了多少？他两个起身，也得给他们几千银子才好。”贾政正是没法，听见贾母一问，心想着：“若是说明，又恐老太太着急；若不说明，不用说将来，只现在怎样办法呢？”想毕，便回道：“若老太太不问，儿子也不敢说。如今老太太既问到这里，现在琏儿也在这里，昨日儿子已查了：旧库的银子早已虚空，不但用尽，外头还有亏空。现今大哥这件事，若不花银托人，虽说主上宽恩，只怕他们爷儿两个也不大好，就是这项银子尚无打算。东省的地亩，早已寅年吃了卯年的租儿了，一时也弄不过来，只好尽所有蒙圣恩没有动的衣服首饰折变了，给大哥和珍儿作盘费罢了。过日的事只可再打算。”贾母听了，又急的眼泪直淌。说道：“怎样着？咱们家到了这个田地了么？我虽没有经过，我想起我家向日比这里还强十倍，也是摆了几年虚架子，没有出这样事，已经塌下来了，不消一二年就完了！据你说起来，咱们竟一两年就不能支了？”贾政道：“若是这两个世俸不动，外头还有些挪移。如今无可指称，谁肯接济？”说着，也泪流满面，“想起亲戚来，用过我们的，如今都穷了；没有用过我们的，又不肯答应。昨日儿子也没有细查，只看了家下的人丁册子，别说上头的钱一无所出，那底下的人也养不起许多。”\n　　贾母正在忧虑，只见贾赦、贾珍、贾蓉一齐进来给贾母请安。贾母看这般光景，一只手拉着贾赦，一只手拉着贾珍，便大哭起来。他两人脸上羞惭，又见贾母哭泣，都跪在地下哭着说道：“儿孙们不长进，将祖上功勋丢了，又累老太太伤心，儿孙们是死无葬身之地的了！”满屋中人看这光景，又一齐大哭起来。贾政只得劝解：“倒先要打算他两个的使用。大约在家只可住得一两日，迟则人家就不依了。”老太太含悲忍泪的说道：“你两个且各自同你们媳妇们说说话儿去罢。”又吩咐贾政道：“这件事是不能久待的。想来外面挪移，恐不中用，那时误了钦限，怎么好？只好我替你们打算罢了。就是家中如此乱糟糟的，也不是常法儿。”一面说着，便叫鸳鸯吩咐去了。这里贾赦等出来，又与贾政哭泣了一会，都不免将从前任性、过后恼悔、如今分离的话说了一会，各自夫妻们那边悲伤去了。贾赦年老，倒还撂的下；独有贾珍与尤氏怎忍分离？贾琏贾蓉两个也只有拉着父亲啼哭。虽说是比军流减等，究竟生离死别。这也是事到如此，只得大家硬着心肠过去。\n　　却说贾母叫邢、王二夫人同着鸳鸯等开箱倒笼，将做媳妇到如今积攒的东西都拿出来，又叫贾赦、贾政、贾珍等一一的分派。给贾赦三千两，说：“这里现有的银子你拿二千两去做你的盘费使用，留一千给大太太零用。这三千给珍儿：你只许拿一千去，留下二千给你媳妇收着。仍旧各自过日子。房子还是一处住，饭食各自吃罢。四丫头将来的亲事，还是我的事。只可怜凤丫头操了一辈子心，如今弄的精光，也给他三千两，叫他自己收着，不许叫琏儿用。如今他还病的神昏气短，叫平儿来拿去。这是你祖父留下的衣裳，还有我少年穿的衣服首饰，如今我也用不着了。男的呢，叫大老爷、珍儿、琏儿、蓉儿拿去分了。女的呢，叫大太太、珍儿媳妇、凤丫头拿了分去。这五百两银子交给琏儿，明年将林丫头的棺材送回南去。”分派定了，又叫贾政道：“你说外头还该着账呢，这是少不得的，你叫拿这金子变卖偿还。这是他们闹掉了我的。你也是我的儿子，我并不偏向。\n宝玉已经成了家，我下剩的这些金银东西，大约还值几千银子，这是都给宝玉的了。珠儿媳妇向来孝顺我，兰儿也好，我也分给他们些。这就是我的事情完了。”贾政等见母亲加此明断分晰，俱跪下哭着说：“老太太这么大年纪，儿孙们没点孝顺，承受老祖宗这样恩典，叫儿孙们更无地自容了。”贾母道：“别瞎说了。要不闹出这个乱儿来，我还收着呢。只是现在家人太多，只有二老爷当差，留几个人就够了，你就吩咐管事的，将人叫齐了，分派妥当。各家有人就罢了。譬如那时都抄了，怎么样呢？我们里头的，也要叫人分派，该配人的配人，赏去的赏去。如今虽说这房子不入官，你到底把这园子交了才是呢。那些地亩还交琏儿清理，该卖的卖，留的留，再不可支架子，做空头。我索性说了罢：江南甄家还有几两银子，二太太那里收着，该叫人就送去罢。倘或再有点事儿出来，可不是他们‘躲过了风暴又遭了雨’了么？”贾政本是不知当家立计的人，一听贾母的话，一一领命，心想：“老太太实在真真是理家的人。都是我们这些不长进的闹坏了。”\n　　贾政见贾母劳乏，求着老太太歇歇养神。贾母又道：“我所剩的东西也有限，等我死了，做结果我的使用。下剩的都给伏侍我的丫头。”贾政等听到这里，更加伤感，大家跪下：“请老太太宽怀。只愿儿子们托老太太的福，过了些时，都邀了恩眷，那时兢兢业业的治起家来，以赎前愆，奉养老太太到一百岁。”贾母道：“但愿这样才好，我死了也好见祖宗。你们别打量我是享得富贵受不得贫穷的人哪！不过这几年看着你们轰轰烈烈，我乐得都不管，说说笑笑，养身子罢了。那知道家运一败，直到这样！若说外头好看，里头空虚，是我早知道的了，只是‘居移气，养移体’，一时下不了台就是了。如今借此正好收敛，守住这个门头儿，不然，叫人笑话。你还不知，只打量我知道穷了，就着急的要死。我心里是想着祖宗莫大的功勋，无一日不指望你们比祖宗还强，能够守住也罢了。谁知他们爷儿两个做些什么勾当！”\n　　贾母正自长篇大论的说，只见丰儿慌慌张张的跑来回王夫人道：“今早我们奶奶听见外头的事，哭了一场，如今气都接不上了，平儿叫我来回太太。”丰儿没有说完，贾母听见，便问：“到底怎么样？”王夫人便代回道：“如今说是不大好。”贾母起身道：“嗳！这些冤家，竟要磨死我了。”说着，叫人扶着，要亲自看去，贾政急忙拦信住劝道：“老太太伤了好一会子心，又分派了好些事，这会子该歇歇儿了。就是孙子媳妇有什么事，叫媳妇瞧去就是了，何必老太太亲身过去呢？倘或再伤感起来，老太太身上要有一点儿不好，叫做儿子的怎么处呢？”贾母道：“你们各自出去，等一会子再进来，我还有话说。”贾政不敢多言，只得出来料理兄侄起身的事，又叫贾琏挑人跟去。这里贾母才叫鸳鸯等派人拿了给凤姐的东西，跟着过来。\n　　凤姐正在气厥。平儿哭的眼肿腮红，听见贾母带着王夫人等过来，疾忙出来迎接。贾母便问：“这会子怎么样了？”平儿恐惊了贾母，便说：“这会子好些儿。”说着，跟了贾母进来，赶忙先走过去，轻轻的揭开帐子。凤姐开眼瞧着，只见贾母进来，满心惭愧。先前原打量贾母等恼他，不疼他了，是死活由他的，不料贾母亲自来瞧，心里一宽，觉那拥塞的气略松动些，便要扎挣坐起。贾母叫平儿按着：“不用动。你好些么？”凤姐含泪道：“我好些了。只是从小儿过来，老太太、太太怎么样疼我！那知我福气薄，叫神鬼支使的失魂落魄，不能够在老太太、太太跟前尽点儿孝心，讨个好儿，还这样把我当人，叫我帮着料理家务，被我闹的七颠八倒，我还有什么脸见老太太、太太呢？今日老太太、太太亲自过来，我更担不起了，恐怕该活三天的又折了两天去了。”说着悲咽。贾母道：“那些事原是外头闹起来的，与你什么相干？就是你的东西被人拿去，这也算不了什么呀。我带了好些东西给你，你瞧瞧。”说着，叫人拿上来给他瞧。凤姐本是贪得无厌的人，如今被抄净尽，自然愁苦，又恐人埋怨，正是几不欲生的时候。今见贾母仍旧疼他，王夫人也不嗔怪，过来安慰他，又想贾琏无事，心下安放好些。便在枕上与贾母磕头，说道：“请老太太放心。若是我的病托着老太太的福好了，我情愿自己当个粗使的丫头，尽心竭力的伏侍老太太、太太罢！”贾母听他说的伤心，不免掉下泪来。\n　　宝玉是从来没有经过这大风浪的，心下只知安乐，不知忧患的人，如今碰来碰去，都是哭泣的事，所以他竞比傻子尤甚，见人哭他就哭。凤姐看见众人忧闷，反倒勉强说几句宽慰贾母的话，求着：“请老太太、太太回去，我略好些过来磕头。”说着，将头仰起。贾母叫平儿：“好生服侍。短什么，到我那里要去。”说着，带了王夫人将要回到自己房中，只听见两三处哭声。贾母听着，实在不忍，便叫王夫人散去，叫宝玉：“去见你大爷大哥，送一送就回来。”自己躺在榻上下泪。幸喜鸳鸯等能用百样言语劝解，贾母暂且安歇。\n　　不言贾赦等分离悲痛。那些跟去的人，谁是愿意的？不免心中抱怨，叫苦连天。正是生离果胜死别，看者比受者更加伤心。好好的一个荣国府，闹到人嚎鬼哭。贾政要循规矩，在伦常上也讲究的，执手分别后，自己先骑马赶至城外，举酒送行，又叮咛了好些“国家轸恤勋臣，力图报称”的话。贾赦等挥泪分头而别。\n　　贾政带了宝玉回家，未及进门，只见门上有好些人在那里乱嚷，说：“今日旨意：将荣国公世职着贾政承袭。”那些人在那里要喜钱，门上人和他们分争，说：“是本来的世职，我们本家袭了，有什么喜报？”那些人说道：“那世职的荣耀，比任什么还难得，你们大老爷闹掉了，想要这个，再不能的了。如今圣上的恩典比天还大，又赏给二老爷了，这是千载难逢的，怎么不给喜钱？”正闹着，贾政回家，门上回了。虽则喜欢，究竟是哥哥犯事所致，反觉感极涕零，赶着进内告诉贾母。贾母自然喜欢，拉着说了些勤黾报恩的话。王夫人正恐贾母伤心，过来安慰，听得世职复还，也是欢喜。独有邢夫人、尤氏心下悲苦，只不好露出来。\n　　且说外面这些趋炎奉势的亲戚朋友，先前贾宅有事，都远避不来；今儿贾政袭职，知圣眷尚好，大家都来贺喜。那知贾政纯厚性成，因他袭哥哥的职，心内反生烦恼，只知感激天恩。于第二日进内谢恩，到底将赏还府第园子备折奏请入官。内廷降旨不必，贾政才得放心回家，以后循分供职。\n　　但是家计萧条，入不敷出。贾政又不能在外应酬。家人们见贾政忠厚，凤姐抱病不能理家，贾琏的亏空一日重似一日，难免典房卖地。府内家人几个有钱的，怕贾琏缠扰，都装穷躲事，甚至告假不来，各自另寻门路。独有一个包勇，虽是新投到此，恰遇荣府坏事，他倒有些真心办事，见那些人欺瞒主子，便时常不忿。奈他是个新来乍到的人，一句话也插不上，他便生气，每日吃了就睡。众人嫌他不肯随和，便在贾政前说他终日贪杯生事，并不当差。贾政道：“随他去罢。原是甄府荐来，不好意思。横竖家内添这一个人吃饭，虽说穷，也不在他一人身上。”并不叫驱逐。众人又在贾琏跟前说他怎么样不好，贾琏此时也不敢自作威福，只得由他。\n　　忽一日，包勇耐不过，吃了几杯酒，在荣府街上闲逛，见有两个人说话。那人说道：“你瞧，这么个大府，前儿抄了家，不知如今怎么样了？”那人道：“他家怎么能败？听见说，里头有位娘娘是他家的姑娘，虽是死了，到底有根基的。况且常见他们来往的都是王公侯伯，那里没有照应？就是现在的府尹，前任的兵部，是他们的一家儿。难道有这些人还护庇不来么？”那人道：“你白住在这里！别人犹可，独是那个贾大人更了不得。我常见他在两府来往，前儿御史虽参了，主子还叫府尹查明实迹再办。你说他怎么样？他本沾过两府的好处，怕人说他回护一家儿，他倒狠狠的踢了一脚，所以两府里才到底抄了。你说如今的世情还了得吗？”两人无心说闲话，岂知旁边有人跟着听的明白。包勇心下暗想：“天下有这样人！但不知是我们老爷的什么人？我若见了他，便打他一个死，闹出事来，我承当去。”那包勇正在酒后胡思乱想，忽听那边喝道而来。包勇远远站着，只见那两人轻轻的说道：“这来的就是那个贾大人了。”包勇听了，心里怀恨，趁着酒兴，便大声说道：“没良心的男女！怎么忘了我们贾家的恩了？”雨村在轿内听得一个“贾”字，便留神观看，见是一个醉汉，也不理会，过去了。\n　　那包勇醉着，不知好歹，便得意洋洋回到府中，问起同伴，知是方才见的那位大人是这府里提拔起来的，“他不念旧恩，反来踢弄咱们家里，见了他骂他几句，他竟不敢答言。”那荣府的人本嫌包勇，只是主人不计较他，如今他又在外头惹祸，正好趁着贾政无事，便将包勇喝酒闹事的话回了贾政。贾政此时正怕风波，听见家人回禀，便一时生气，叫进包勇来数骂了几句，也不好深沉责罚他，便派去看园，不许他在外行走。那包勇本是个直爽的脾气，投了主子，他便赤心护主，那知贾政反倒听了别的人话骂他。他也不敢再辩，只得收拾行李往园中看守浇灌去了。\n未知后事如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jia Zheng entered the palace and paid his respects to the grand secretaries and princes assembled in the Council of State.\n\nThe Prince of Beijing told him, “We have summoned you today to question you by His Majesty’s orders.”\n\nJia Zheng promptly fell on his knees.\n\nThe grand secretaries asked, “Are you aware of the charges against your elder brother? That he intrigued with provincial officials, bullied the weak, allowed his son to gather a gambling party, and tried to seize the wife and daughter of some good citizen, driving the man to death when he failed?”\n\nJia Zheng bowed his head. “Since His Majesty appointed me chief examiner and I later inspected relief work, I went home last winter. Then I was put in charge of construction work and after that served as grain intendant of Jiangxi, after which I was impeached and recalled to the capital, where I worked in the Ministry of Works. I have not dared to be remiss in my duties day or night, but have neglected household affairs and know nothing about them. I am too stupid to control my sons and nephews, and so have failed to show proper gratitude for the Imperial favour. I beg to be severely punished by His Majesty.”\n\nThe Prince of Beijing reported this. Soon an Imperial decree was issued, and the prince announced, “His Majesty has taken note of the censor’s impeachment of Jia Sheh for intriguing with provincial officials and bullying the weak. According to the censor, he had dealings with the prefect of Pingan and was in the habit of packing lawsuits. But when Jia Sheh was cross-examined, he testified that his dealings with that prefect were on account of their family connection and had nothing to do with official business; and the censor was unable to substantiate his charge. The only charge proved is that he used his influence to extort some old fans from Stone Idiot; however, these being mere curios, it is not as if he had extorted them from some good citizen. Though Stone Idiot committed suicide, this was on account of his own foolish madness and differs from death under pressure. Jia Sheh is therefore pardoned and sent to a frontier post to redeem his crimes by good service.\n\n“As for the charge that Jia Zhen seized a good citizen’s wife or daughter to be his concubine and drove her to death when she refused, the Censorate’s investigation has shown that Second Sister You was betrothed while still in the womb to Zhang Hua, who had not married her. Because of his poverty she broke off the engagement of her own free will, and her mother was willing to marry her to Jia Zhen’s brother, so this was not a case of seizure.\n\n“Another charge was that Third Sister You, after cutting her throat, was buried without any report to the authorities. The investigation shows that she was the sister of Jia Zhen’s wife, and he had intended to find a husband for her. But when he pressed her for some betrothal gifts, slanderous talk drove her to hang herself in shame and anger; so she was not hounded to death by Jia Zhen. However, as a hereditary official he showed contempt for the law by burying her without reporting it. He should be severely punished, but in consideration of the fact that he is the descendant of a meritorious minister, We cannot bear to punish him. He too is pardoned and deprived of his hereditary rank, then sent to serve at a coastal outpost to redeem his crime. Jia Rong, being young, is not involved and is released.\n\n“Jia Zheng, having held provincial posts for many years, has been circumspect and diligent in his work. He is excused from punishment for failing to control his household.”\n\nJia Zheng kotowed gratefully, then begged the prince to express his heartfelt thanks to the Emperor.\n\n“You should thank His Majesty. Is there anything else you wish me to report?” asked the prince.\n\n“I am overwhelmed by the Imperial goodness which has not punished me severely and is even returning our confiscated property. In my gratitude, I would like to hand over to the state the property left by my ancestors as well as my own savings.”\n\n“His Majesty in his benevolence to his subjects is just and careful in meting out punishments and rewards. Since he has shown such great goodness by returning your property, why make this request?” The other ministers also said it was unnecessary.\n\nThen Jia Zheng, having thanked them and kotowed to the prince, took his leave. Anxious to reassure the Lady Dowager, he hurried home. The whole household, not knowing what this summons from the palace had portended, had been waiting on tenterhooks for news. At sight of him they were somewhat reassured, but dared not question him.\n\nHe hurried to his mother and described in detail the Emperor’s magnanimity. Although relieved, the old lady was distressed to hear that both hereditary titles had been confiscated and Jia Sheh and Jia Zhen had been sent to distant posts. Lady Xing and Madam You burst out weeping at this.\n\n“Set your heart at rest, madam,” urged Jia Zheng. “Although my elder brother has to serve at a frontier post, he will be working for the state and won’t have to suffer. If he does well, he may be reinstated. As for Zhen, he’s young and should do his bit. If not for this, the virtue of our ancestors would not have sufficed to preserve our estates.”\n\nHe went on in this vein to comfort her.\n\nAs we saw in the last chapter, the Lady Dowager had never liked Jia She, and Jia Zhen of the East Mansion after all belonged to a different branch of the family. So only Lady Xing and Madam You wept uncontrollably.\n\nLady Xing reflected, “All our property is gone. My husband is old and being exiled; and though Lian is my son he has always sided with his Second Uncle. Now that we’re dependent on him, of course he and his wife will side with them more than ever. I shall be left all on my own. What am I to do?”\n\nMadam You had been in sole charge of the Ning Mansion’s affairs. Apart from Jia Zhen she ranked as the mistress, and they had always been on good terms. Now that he had been found guilty and exiled and their property confiscated, though the old lady was kind to her she was dependent on the Rong Mansion. Besides, she had to look after Phei-feng and Chieh-luan, and her son Jung and his wife were not yet able to restore the family’s fortunes. She reflected, “My second and third sister-in-law were involved by Lian, yet they’re both all right and have been reunited with their husbands; but how are the few of us left here to live?” This set her weeping too.\n\nThe Lady Dowager, much distressed, asked Jia Zheng, “Can your elder brother and Zhen come back, now that their cases have been settled? And since Jung was found not guilty, he should be released.”\n\n“According to the law, elder brother can’t come back,” he answered. “But I’ve asked someone to do us a favour and let him come home with his son to get their luggage ready, and the yamen has agreed. So I think Jung will be coming out with his father and grandfather. Don’t worry, madam. I’ll see to it.”\n\n“I’ve grown so dreadfully old these last few years,” she said, “that I’ve stopped asking about household affairs. We know the East Mansion was confiscated and of course that means their house too. But now your elder brother’s place and Lian’s have been raided too. How much is left of our stables in the West Mansion and our estates in the east? We must give those two who are going away several thousand taels.”\n\nJia Zheng was at his wit’s end. He thought, “If I tell her the truth, the old lady may have a shock; but if I don’t, what’s to be done?” Finally he answered, “If you hadn’t asked, madam, I wouldn’t have dared to tell you. Since now you have, and as Lian is here too, I’ll report that yesterday I made an investigation. Our old treasury is empty. Not only have we spent all that was in it, we’re in debt outside. If we’d spent no money to get people to intercede for Elder Brother, even though the Emperor is so kind I’m afraid things would have gone badly for him and his son. But we’ve no means of raising that sum. The income from our eastern estates was mortgaged long ago; we can’t get so much cash in a hurry. The only way out is to pawn the clothes and jewels which His Majesty has not confiscated, to provide travelling expenses for Elder Brother and Zhen. As for the future, we shall have to cross that bridge when we come to it.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager wept in consternation. “How have we come down in the world like this?” she exclaimed. “I know our family isn’t what it was, but I never thought we were so badly off. I remember hearing that my family in the old days was ten times better off than this. After putting up a show of affluence for some years without any major disasters, we went downhill, and in less than a couple of years we were bankrupt! Do you mean we can’t even hold out for a year or two?”\n\nJia Zheng answered tearfully, “If we still had the two hereditary stipends we could raise some loans outside; but we’ve no security now, and who would be willing to help us? When I think of our relatives, those who used to sponge on us are poor now, while those who didn’t won’t agree to help. I didn’t go carefully into the matter yesterday, but I checked the list of our domestic staff. We not only have no money coming in, we can’t even afford the upkeep of so many servants.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager was distraught. Just then Jia She, Jia Zhen and Jia Jung came in to pay their respects.\n\nWith this she took Chia Sheh’s hand in one of hers and Chia Chen’s in the other, and burst out sobbing. Ashamed and distressed by her tears, the two men fell on their knees.\n\n“Because we worthless sons and grandsons have failed to live up to our ancestors’ merits and made you grieve so, madam, we deserve to die without a burial place!” they cried.\n\nTheir distress set the whole household wailing again.\n\nChia Cheng had to urge, “We must first decide how to raise the money for their journey. They can only stay at home for a day or two at most; if we delay any longer, the yamen will send to press us.”\n\nThe old lady, choking down her tears, told the two culprits, “You’d better go now and have a talk with your wives.” She instructed Chia Cheng, “This business can’t be put off. If you try to raise a loan outside and that delays you past the deadline set by the court, what then? I shall have to provide for you. Besides, this confusion we’re in can’t go on.” She sent Yuanyang away to carry out her orders.\n\nThen Chia Sheh and the others left. They wept for a while with Chia Cheng, confessing how self-willed they had been in the past, how they now repented, and how hard they found this parting. Then they went off sadly to their own apartments. Old Chia Sheh could still take this blow; but how could Chia Chen and Madam Yu bear to part? And Chia Lien and Chia Jung clung to their fathers, sobbing. Although their punishment was lighter than banishment with the army, this was a life-and-death parting. However, as things had come to such a pass, they had to harden their hearts.\n\nThe Lady Dowager sent for Lady Hsing and Lady Wang as well as Yuanyang, and told them to open all her cases and trunks and bring out the savings she had put by since her marriage. Then she made a distribution, giving Chia Sheh three thousand taels.\n\n“Take two thousand of this for your journey,” she said, “and leave the third thousand for your wife for household expenses. Take three thousand to Chen. But you’re only to have one thousand of it; the other two thousand must be kept by your wife. You’ll have to live apart from now on. You can still share the same house, but you must cater for yourselves. And Hsi-chun’s future marriage will be my responsibility. I’m sorry Hsi-feng has worn herself out looking after things, only to end up with nothing; so I’m giving her three thousand taels too. She must keep it herself, and not let Lien have it. As she’s still so ill and confused, give it to Ping-erh for her. Here are some clothes left by your grandfather, and some of my own when I was young — clothes and trinkets which are no use to me now. The men’s clothes can be shared out between the elder master, Chen, Lien and Jung. The women’s can go to the elder mistress, Chen’s wife and Hsi-feng. This five hundred taels of silver is for Lien: next year, when he has time, he must take Lin girl’s coffin south.”\n\nHaving made these dispositions she told Chia Cheng, “You said there are still some debts outside which must be paid. We can’t avoid that. You must sell this gold to settle them. They’re the ones who’ve squandered all I had. But you’re my son too, and I’m not being partial. Since Pao-yu’s married now, the gold and silver I have left, worth several thousand taels, are all for him. And since Chu’s wife has always been good to me and Lan is a good boy, I’m giving them some too. That’s all I can do.”\n\nChia Cheng and the others knelt down.\n\n“At our great age we’ve done nothing to show our filial piety,” they protested, “instead, we’ve accept-ed your generous bounty, madam, making us too ashamed to look you in the face!”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense,” she retorted. “If we hadn’t had this upset, of course I’d have kept my savings. But the household’s too big, with only the second master in official service. We only need a few servants — you can tell the stewards to send the rest away. We must make a proper allocation of servants to each household. When the whole estate was confiscated, didn’t some of the servants have to leave?\n\n\"Well, what's to be done? Those of our servants who are entitled to emancipation should be given their freedom, and those who deserve rewards should be given some presents. Although our house has not been confiscated, you must hand over the Garden. As for our landholdings, let Lian dispose of them: some can be sold, some kept. But no more keeping up appearances and putting on empty shows! I'll speak frankly. There's still some silver belonging to the Zhen family of the South in the charge of Lady Wang. Send someone to return it to them at once. If any further charges are brought against us, won't they be 'out of the frying pan into the fire'?\"\n\nJia Zheng, who had no experience in managing a household, agreed to all the old lady's proposals, thinking: \"The old lady really knows how to run a family. We're the ones who have mismanaged things and ruined it.\"\n\nSeeing how tired she was, he begged her to rest and recover her composure.\n\n\"I haven't much left,\" she told him. \"When I die, use what I have for my funeral. The remainder can be divided among the maids who have waited on me.\"\n\nThis reduced Jia Zheng and the others to even greater distress. They knelt down and said, \"Do set your heart at rest, madam. We pray that, thanks to your good fortune, we may before long receive a royal pardon enabling us to work hard to redeem our past faults and serve you devotedly till you are a hundred.\"\n\n\"I hope it turns out that way, so that I can face our ancestors after my death,\" she replied. \"Don't imagine I'm one who can enjoy luxury but not poverty! It's just that these last few years, seeing you all making such a grand show, I was only too glad to take things easy, have a good time and look after my health. Who could have guessed that our family would decline to this extent! I knew all along that we were presenting a fine appearance outside but were bankrupt inside. As the proverb says, 'Habits change with one's environment and physical condition.' Still, it was hard for me to cut our coat according to our cloth. Now that we've come down in the world this is a good chance to retrench and keep up our reputation -- otherwise people will laugh at us. You don't understand. You think I'm frantic because I know we're poor. But what weighs on my mind is the magnificent achievements of our forefathers. Every day I hoped you would outdo them and at least keep up our property. Who could have known that the two masters would get up to such tricks!\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager was still holding forth when Feng'er came rushing in frantically to report to Lady Wang, \"Our mistress heard the news from outside and wept all morning. Now she can't get her breath and Pinger has sent me to tell you, madam.\"\n\nBefore she could finish, the old lady asked, \"What is it?\"\n\nLady Wang answered for the maid, \"They say Xifeng is in a bad way.\"\n\nThe old lady rose to her feet. \"Ai! Those wretched children! Do they mean to be the death of me?\" She called for maids to support her so that she could go to see for herself.\n\nJia Zheng stepped forward to dissuade her. \"You've been so upset, madam, and have given so many orders, you must rest now. If your grandson's wife is ill, my wife can go to see her. Why should you trouble to go yourself? If seeing her distresses you again and you fall ill, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"You all go out now and come back later, as I've more to say,\" she ordered.\n\nNot venturing to say any more, Jia Zheng withdrew to make arrangements for his brother's and nephew's departure, instructing Jia Lian to choose some servants to accompany them. Then the old lady told Yuanyang and the other maids to take Xifeng's presents and go with her.\n\nXifeng was in a state of collapse. Pinger's eyes were swollen from weeping. When they heard that the old lady was coming with Lady Wang and the rest, she hurried out to meet them.\n\n\"How is she now?\" the old lady asked.\n\nNot wanting to alarm her, Pinger said, \"She's a little better.\" She helped the old lady in, then stepped forward to lift the curtain gently.\n\nThe bed-curtains. As Xifeng opened her eyes and saw the Lady Dowager coming in, she was filled with shame. She had thought Their Ladyships were angry with her and had abandoned her to live or die as she pleased. Never had she expected Their Ladyships to come in person to see her. This was such a relief that the congestion in her chest seemed to ease a little and she struggled to sit up.\n\n“Don’t move,” said the old lady, telling Pinger to hold her down. “Are you feeling better?”\n\n“A little better,” whispered Xifeng with tears. “When I think how good you and Her Ladyship were to me ever since I was small! But I have no luck. Some demon must have addled my wits and made me so crazy that I couldn’t show my gratitude by waiting on you and winning your approval. Yet you still treated me as a human being, putting me in charge of the household — and I turned everything upside down! How can I ever look you in the face again? Now that you’ve come in person, I don’t deserve such kindness. I’m afraid instead of living three days longer I may lose two.”\n\n“All that trouble was stirred up by outsiders, it had nothing to do with you,” the old lady consoled her. “Even if your things were taken, that doesn’t matter. I’ve brought you a whole lot of things — look.”\n\nShe ordered the maids to show them to Xifeng, who was by nature insatiably acquisitive. Now that all her possessions had been confiscated she was naturally frantic, and afraid too that she would be blamed. She had been wishing she could die. But the old lady’s kind visit and Lady Wang’s lack of reproach, coming to comfort her, as well as the news that Jia Lian was in the clear, had set her mind at rest. She kowtowed from her pillow to the old lady.\n\n“Set your heart at rest, madam,” she said. “If thanks to your good fortune I recover, I’ll gladly work as a maid to wait on you and Her Ladyship with all my heart!”\n\nThe old lady could not help weeping to hear how broken-hearted she was.\n\nBaoyu, who had never experienced such great upheavals before and had known only happiness, not suffering, was now surrounded by people weeping. This affected him even more than a simpleton, so that he wept whenever he saw others in tears. Xifeng, however, at sight of the general despondency forced herself to say a few words to comfort the old lady, then begged her and Lady Wang to return to their apartments.\n\n“I’ll come to kowtow my thanks when I’m a little better,” she said, raising her head.\n\nThe Lady Dowager told Pinger, “Take good care of her. If you need anything, come and ask me for it.” Then she took Lady Wang back to her own quarters.\n\nOn the way they heard waiting-maids sobbing in two or three different places. This was more than the old lady could bear.\n\n“Go back now,” she said to Lady Wang, and told Baoyu to see his father and brother off before returning. Then she lay down on her couch and wept. Luckily Yuanyang and the other maids could comfort her in various ways, and she finally calmed down enough to rest.\n\nBut no more of the grief at the separation of Jia She and the others. None of the servants taken with them were willing to go, and they inevitably complained bitterly, lamenting their fate. Indeed, this parting was worse than death, and the spectators were even more upset than the victims. So the whole Rong Mansion rang with lamentations.\n\nJia Zheng, a stickler for the rules and a believer in the principles of Confucianism, after clasping hands in farewell mounted his horse and rode to the city gate. There, raising his wine cup, he urged Jia She and the others to do their best to atone for their crimes by good service, in view of the Imperial clemency to meritorious ministers. Then Jia She and the others parted from him in tears.\n\nJia Zheng took Baoyu home. Before they entered the gate, they saw many servants there clamouring noisily.\n\n“We’ve received an edict today,” they announced, “that Master Zheng is to inherit the title of Duke of Rongguo!”\n\nThese men were demanding tips, but the gatemen argued, “This is the hereditary title which our master was to inherit anyway. Why should you demand tips for that?”\n\n“The honour of a title is more valuable than anything else,” they retorted. “Your Elder Master has thrown his away. He could never have hoped to get this back. Now that His Majesty in His goodness has shown such\n\nThis is an extraordinary piece of good fortune, a chance in a thousand! You must give us some largesse to celebrate.”\n\nJust then Jia Zheng came home and the gatemen reported this to him. Although pleased by the news, because it resulted from his elder brother’s impeachment he was moved to tears. He hurried in to tell the Lady Dowager, who of course was overjoyed and urged him to work hard to prove himself worthy of this Imperial favour. Lady Wang had been afraid that the old lady might be distressed and had come to comfort her; and this good news delighted her too. Only Lady Xing and Madam You were inwardly miserable, though they did not show it.\n\nAs for those fickle friends and relatives outside, at the time of the Jia family’s disaster they had all steered clear of them; but now that Jia Zheng had inherited the title and was obviously back in Imperial favour, they came to offer congratulations. However, Jia Zheng, being a sincere man, was more upset than pleased by his inheritance of his brother’s title, simply feeling profound gratitude for the Emperor’s kindness. The next day he went to court to express his thanks, and begged to have the mansions and Garden which had been returned to him converted into official premises. Not until a decree arrived from the Inner Court forbidding this was his mind set at rest and he could go home. After that he performed his duties conscientiously.\n\nBut the household’s finances were in a bad way, their expenditure exceeding their income. And as Jia Zheng was not one to socialize, his stewards saw that he was honest and simple, Xifeng was too ill to run the household, and Jia Lian’s debts were mounting. They could not avoid pawning or selling property. Some of the servants who had money were afraid that Jia Lian would ask to borrow from them, and therefore pretended to be hard up or stayed away, some even asking for leave so that they could look for other jobs. Only Bao Yong, newly recruited, had come just at the time of the Rong Mansion’s disgrace and showed his good faith by working hard. It incensed him to see the others cheating their masters; but being a newcomer he could not get a word in, and so he took to stuffing himself with food then sleeping, in a fit of temper. The other servants, resenting his refusal to toe the line, told Jia Zheng that he was a drunkard and trouble-maker who neglected his duties.\n\n“Let him be,” said Jia Zheng. “He was recommended by the Zhen family, and I don’t like to dismiss him. Poor as we are, one more or less doesn’t make much difference.” So he did not send him away.\n\nThe others then complained to Jia Lian that Bao Yong was no good; but Jia Lian, not venturing to act on his own authority, let him stay.\n\nOne day, having nothing to do, Bao Yong drank a few cups of wine and strolled out to the main street near the Rong Mansion. There he overheard two men talking.\n\n“Just see what a big family like that can come to!” one said. “The other day they were raided, and we don’t know how they’re doing now.”\n\n“How could they go under?” the other retorted. “I hear one of their young ladies was a Imperial Consort. She may have died, but they’ve still got powerful backing. Besides, I often see them calling on dukes and marquises — they’re bound to have protectors. Why, the present prefect and the former Minister of War are their relatives. With so many bigwigs to shield them, can they come to grief?”\n\n“You live here for nothing!” the first man scoffed. “Others may be all right, but not that Lord Jia. I often see him calling at both mansions, and though the other day the censor impeached him, the Emperor ordered the prefect to investigate before taking action. Do you know what he did? Because he’d had help from both mansions and was afraid of being accused of favouritism, he gave them a fierce kick — that’s why their property was confiscated. Well, well! What is the world coming to?”\n\nThis chance conversation was clearly overheard by Bao Yong, who thought angrily, “So there are such heartless men in the world! I wonder who this Lord Jia is. If I set eyes on him, I’ll beat him to death. I’ll take the consequences.” He was tipsily nursing this foolish idea when he heard the approach of horsemen and saw the two men in front whisper, “Here comes that Lord Jia.”\n\nHate welled up in Bao Yong. Under the influence of wine he cried boldly, “Heartless...”\n\nThis couple have forgotten the kindness shown them by our Jia family!”\n\nFrom his chair Yucun heard the name Jia and craned forward to look. At sight of a drunkard, however, he paid no attention and passed on.\n\nBao Yong in his cups had lost all sense of proportion. He swaggered back to the mansion and asked the other servants who that official was. When told that he had been promoted by their house, he exclaimed, “Instead of being grateful for past favours, he kicks us when we’re down! I cursed him just now, but he didn’t dare answer back!”\n\nThe Rong Mansion servants had always disliked Bao Yong, but their master had ignored his faults. Now that he had made trouble outside, taking advantage of the fact that Jia Zheng was at home they reported that he had been drinking and brawling. Jia Zheng, just then very jumpy, lost his temper and summoned Bao Yong to give him a talking-to. However, not venturing to punish him too severely, he ordered him to keep an eye on the Garden and not to venture outside again. Being a straightforward fellow, since he had attached himself to this family Bao Yong was whole-heartedly loyal. He had not expected to be blamed on the strength of other people’s tales; but not venturing to defend himself he had to pack his things and move into the Garden to keep watch and do the watering.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
