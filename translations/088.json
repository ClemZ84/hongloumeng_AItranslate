  "original": "却说惜春正在那里揣摩棋谱，忽听院内有人叫彩屏，不是别人却是鸳鸯的声儿。彩屏出去，同着鸳鸯进来。那鸳鸯却带着一个小丫头，提了一个小黄绢包儿。惜春笑问道：“什么事？”鸳鸯道：“老太太因明年八十一岁，是个暗九。许下一场九昼夜的功德，发心要写三千六百五十零一部《金刚经》。这已发出外面人写了。但是俗说《金刚经》就像那道家的符壳，《心经》才算是符胆。故此《金刚经》内必要插着《心经》，更有功德。老太太因《心经》是更要紧的，观自在又是女菩萨，所以要几个亲丁奶奶姑娘们写上三百六十五部，如此又虔诚，又洁净。咱们家中除了二奶奶，头一宗他当家没有空儿，二宗他也写不上来，其余会写字的，不论写得多少，连东府珍大奶奶姨娘们都分了去，本家里头自不用说。”惜春听了，点头道：“别的我做不来，若要写经，我最信心的。你搁下喝茶罢。”鸳鸯才将那小包儿搁在桌上，同惜春坐下。彩屏倒了一钟茶来。惜春笑问道：“你写不写？”鸳鸯道：“姑娘又说笑话了。那几年还好，这三四年来姑娘见我还拿了拿笔儿么。”惜春道：“这却是有功德的。”鸳鸯道：“我也有一件事：向来服侍老太太安歇后，自己念上米佛，已经念了三年多了。我把这个米收好，等老太太做功德的时候，我将他衬在里头供佛施食，也是我一点诚心。”惜春道：“这样说来，老太太做了观音，你就是龙女了。”鸳鸯道：“那里跟得上这个分儿。却是除了老太太，别的也服侍不来，不晓得前世什么缘分儿。”说着要走，叫小丫头把小绢包打开，拿出来道：“这素纸一紥是写《心经》的。”又拿起一子儿藏香道：“这是叫写经时点着写的。”惜春都应了。\n    鸳鸯遂辞了出来，同小丫头来至贾母房中，回了一遍。看见贾母与李纨打双陆，鸳鸯旁边瞧着。李纨的骰子好，掷下去把老太太的锤打下了好几个去。鸳鸯抿着嘴儿笑。忽见宝玉进来，手中提了两个细蔑丝的小笼子，笼内有几个蝈蝈儿，说道：“我听说老太太夜里睡不着，我给老太太留下解解闷。”贾母笑道：“你别瞅着你老子不在家，你只管淘气。”宝玉笑道：“我没有淘气。”贾母道：“你没淘气，不在学房里念书，为什么又弄这个东西呢。”宝玉道：“不是我自己弄的。今儿因师父叫环儿和兰儿对对子，环儿对不来，我悄悄的告诉了他。他说了，师父喜欢，夸了他两句。他感激我的情，买了来孝敬我的。我才拿了来孝敬老太太的。”贾母道：“他没有天天念书么，为什么对不上来？对不上来就叫你儒大爷爷打他的嘴巴子，看他臊不臊。你也够受了，不记得你老子在家时，一叫做诗做词，唬的倒像个小鬼儿似的，这会子又说嘴了。那环儿小子更没出息，求人替做了，就变着方法儿打点人。这么点子孩子就闹鬼闹神的，也不害臊，赶大了还不知是个什么东西呢。”说的满屋子人都笑了。\n贾母又问道：“兰小子呢，做上来了没有？这该环儿替他了，他又比他小了。是不是？”宝玉笑道：“他倒没有，却是自己对的。”贾母道：“我不信，不然就也是你闹了鬼了。如今你还了得，‘羊群里跑出骆驼来了，就只你大。’你又会做文章了。”宝玉笑道：“实在是他作的。师父还夸他明儿一定大有出息呢。老太太不信，就打发人叫了他来亲自试试，老太太就知道了。”贾母道：“果然这么着我才喜欢。我不过怕你撒谎。既是他做的，这孩子明儿大概还有一点儿出息。”因看着李纨，又想起贾珠来，“这也不枉你大哥哥死了，你大嫂子拉扯他一场，日后也替你大哥哥顶门壮户。”说到这里，不禁流下泪来。李纨听了这话，却也动心，只是贾母已经伤心，自己连忙忍住泪笑劝道：“这是老祖宗的余德，我们托着老祖宗的福罢咧。只要他应得了老祖宗的话，就是我们的造化了。老祖宗看着也喜欢，怎么倒伤起心来呢。”因又回头向宝玉道：“宝叔叔明儿别这么夸他，他多大孩子，知道什么。你不过是爱惜他的意思，他那里懂得，一来二去，眼大心肥，那里还能够有长进呢。”贾母道：“你嫂子这也说的是。就只他还太小呢，也别逼靠紧了他。；小孩子胆儿小，一时逼急了，弄出点子毛病来，书倒念不成，把你的工夫都白遭塌了。”贾母说到这里，李纨却忍不住扑簌簌掉下泪来，连忙擦了。\n　　只见贾环、贾兰也都进来给贾母请了安。贾兰又见过他母亲，然后过来，在贾母傍边侍立。贾母道：“我刚才听见你叔叔说你对的好对子，师父夸你来着。”贾兰也不言语，只管抿着嘴儿笑。鸳鸯过来说道：“请示老太太，晚饭伺候下了。”贾母道：“请你姨太太去罢。”琥珀接着便叫人去王夫人那边请薛姨妈。这里宝玉、贾环退出，素云和小丫头们过来把双陆收起，李纨尚等着伺候贾母的晚饭。贾兰便跟着他母亲站着。贾母道：“你们娘儿两个跟着我吃罢。”李纨答应了。一时，摆上饭来，丫鬟回来禀道：“太太叫回老太太：姨太太这几天浮来暂去，不能过来回老太太，今日饭后家去了。”于是贾母叫贾兰在身傍边坐下，大家吃饭，不必细言。\n　　却说贾母刚吃完了饭，盥漱了，歪在床上说闲话儿。只见小丫头告诉琥珀，琥珀过来回贾母道：“东府大爷请晚安来了。”贾母道：“你们告诉他，如今他办理家务乏乏的，叫他歇着去罢。我知道了。”小丫头告诉老婆子们，老婆子才告诉贾珍，贾珍然后退出。\n　　到了次日，贾珍过来料理诸事。门上小厮陆续回了几件事。又一个小厮回道：“庄头送果子来了。”贾珍道：“单子呢？”那小厮连忙呈上。贾珍看时，上面写着不过是时鲜果品，还夹带菜蔬野味若干在内。贾珍看完，问：“向来经管的是谁？”门上的回道：“是周瑞。”便叫周瑞：“照账点清，送往里头交代。等我把来账抄下一个底子，留着好对。”又叫：“告诉厨房，把下菜中添几宗，给送果子的来人，照常赏饭给钱。”周瑞答应了，一面叫人搬至凤姐儿院子里去，又把庄上的账和果子交代明白。出去了一回儿，又进来回贾珍道：“才刚来的果子，大爷曾点过数目没有？”贾珍道：“我那里有工夫点这个呢？给了你账，你照账点就是了。”周瑞道：“小的曾点过，也没有少，也不能多出来。大爷既留下底子，再叫送果子来的人，问问他这账是真的假的。”贾珍道：“这是怎么说？不过是几个果子罢咧，有什么要紧？我又没有疑你。”说着，只见鲍二走来磕了一个头，说道：“求大爷原旧放小的在外头伺候罢。”贾珍道：“你们这又是怎么着？”鲍二道：“奴才在这里又说不上话来。”贾珍道：“谁叫你说话？”鲍二道：“何苦来在这里做眼睛珠儿？”周瑞接一道：“奴才在这里经管地租庄子银钱出入，每年也有三五十万来往，老爷太太奶奶们从没有说过话的，何况这些零星东西？若照鲍二说起来，爷们家里的田地房产都被奴才们弄完了。”贾珍想道：“必是鲍二在这里拌嘴，不如叫他出去。”因向鲍二说道：“快滚罢！”又告诉周瑞说：“你也不用说了，你干你的事罢。”二人各自散了。\n　　贾珍正在书房里歇着，听见门上闹的翻江搅海，叫人去查问，回来悦道：“鲍二和周瑞的干儿子打架。”贾珍道：“周瑞的干儿子是谁？”门上的回道：“他叫何三，本来是个没味儿的，天天在家里吃酒闹事，常来门上坐着，听见鲍二周瑞拌嘴，他就插在里头。”贾珍道：“这却可恶！把鲍二和那个什么何三给我一块捆起来。周瑞呢？”门上的回道：“打架时，他先走了。”贾珍道：“给我拿了来。这还了得了！”众人答应了。正嚷着，贾琏也回来了，贾珍便告诉了一遍。贾琏道：“这还了得。”又添了人去拿周瑞。周瑞知道躲不过，也找到了。贾珍便叫：“都捆上！”贾琏便向周瑞道：“你们前头的话也不要紧，大爷说开了很是了，为什么外头又打架？你们打架已经使不得，又弄个野杂种什么何三来闹。你不压伏压伏他们，倒竟走了！”就把周瑞踢了几脚。贾珍道：“单打周瑞不中用。”喝命人把鲍二和何三各人打了五十鞭子，摆了出去，方和贾琏两个商量正事。\n　　下人背地里便生出许多议论来：也有说贾珍护短的，也有说不会调停的；也有说他本不是好人，“前儿尤家姐妹弄出许多丑事来，那鲍二不是他调停着二爷叫了来的吗？这会子又嫌鲍二不济事，必是鲍二的女人伏侍不到了。”人多嘴杂，纷纷不一。\n　　却说贾政自从在工部掌印，家人中尽有发财的。那贾芸听见了，也要插手弄一点事儿，便在外头说了几个工头，讲了成数，便买了些时新绣货，要走凤姐儿的门子。\n　　凤姐正在屋里，听见丫头们说：“大爷、二爷都生了气，在外头打人呢。”凤姐听了，不知何故。正要叫人去问问，只见贾琏已进来了，把外面的事告诉了一遍。凤姐道：“事情虽不要紧，但这风俗儿断不可长。此刻还算咱们家里正旺的时候儿，他们就敢打架，以后小辈儿们当了家，他们越发难制伏了。前年我在东府里亲眼见过焦大吃的烂醉，躺在台阶子底下骂人，不管上上下下，一混汤子的混骂。他虽是有过功的人，到底主子奴才的名分，也要存点体统儿才好。珍大奶奶不是我说，是个老实头，个个人都叫他养得无法无天的。如今又弄出一个什么鲍二，我还听见是你和珍大爷得用的人，为什么今儿又打他呢？”贾琏听了这话刺心，便觉讪讪的，拿话来支开，借有事，说着就走了。\n　　小红进来回道：“芸二爷在外头要见奶奶。”凤姐一想：“他又来做什么？”便道：“叫他进来罢。”小红出来，瞅着贾芸微微一笑。贾芸赶忙凑近一步，问道：“姑娘替我回了没有？”小红红了脸，说道：“我就是见二爷的事多！”贾芸道：“何曾有多少事能到里头来劳动姑娘呢？就是那一年姑娘在宝二叔房里，我才和姑娘……”小红怕人撞见，不等说完，连忙问道：“那年我换给二爷的一块绢子，二爷见了没有？”那贾芸听了这句话，喜的心花俱开，才要说话，只见一个小丫头从里面出来，贾芸连忙同着小红往里走。两个人一左一右，相离不远。贾芸悄悄的道：“回来我出来，还是你送出我来。我告诉你，还有笑话儿呢。”小红听了，把脸飞红，瞅了贾芸一眼，也不答言。和他到了凤姐门口，自己先进去回了，然后出来，掀起帘子点手儿，口中却故意说道：“奶奶请芸二爷进来呢。”\n　　贾芸笑了一笑，跟着他走进房来，见了凤姐儿，请了安，并说：“母亲叫问好。”凤姐也问了他母亲好。凤姐道：“你来有什么事？”贾芸道：“侄儿从前承婶娘疼爱，心上时刻想着，总过意不去。欲要孝敬婶娘。又怕婶娘多想。如今重阳时候，略备了一点儿东西。婶娘这里那一件没有呢？不过是侄儿一点孝心。只怕婶娘不赏脸。”凤姐儿笑道：“有话坐下说。”贾芸才侧身坐了，连忙将东西捧着搁在旁边桌上。凤姐又道：“你不是什么有馀的人，何苦又去花钱？我又不等着使。你今儿来意，是怎么个想头儿，你倒是实说。”贾芸道：“并没有别的想头儿，不过感念婶娘的恩惠，过意不去罢咧。”说着，微微的笑了。凤姐道：“不是这么说。你手里窄，我很知道，我何苦白白儿使你的？你要我收下这个东西，须先和我说明白了。要是这么‘含着骨头露着肉’的，我倒不收。”贾芸没法儿，只得站起来，陪着笑儿说道：“并不是有什么妄想，前几日听见老爷总办陵工，侄儿有几个朋友办过好些工程，极妥当的，要求婶娘在老爷跟前提一提。办得一两种，侄儿再忘不了婶娘的恩典！若是家里用得着侄儿，也能给婶娘出力。”凤姐道：“若是别的，我却可以作主。至于衙门里的事，上头呢，都是堂官司员定的；底下呢，都是那些书班衙役们办的；别人只怕插不上手。连自己的家人，也不过跟着老爷伏侍伏侍，就是你二叔去，亦只是为的是各自家里的事，他也并不能搀越公事。伦家事，这里是踩一头儿撬一头儿的，连珍大爷还弹压不住。你的年纪儿又轻，辈数儿又小，那里缠的清这些人呢？况且衙门里头的事差不多儿也要完了，不过吃饭瞎跑。你在家里什么事作不得，难道没了这碗饭吃不成？我这是实在话，你自己回去想想就知道了。你的情意，我已经领了，把东西快拿回去，是那里弄来的，仍旧给人家送了去罢。”\n　　正说着，只见奶妈子一大起带了巧姐儿进来。那巧姐儿身上穿得锦团花簇，手里拿着好些玩意儿，笑嘻嘻走到凤姐身边学舌。贾芸一见，便站起来，笑盈盈的赶着说道：“这就是大妹妹么？你要什么好东西不要？”那巧姐儿便“哑”的一声哭了。贾芸连忙退下。凤姐道：“乖乖不怕。”连忙将巧姐揽在怀里，道：“这是你芸大哥哥，怎么认起生来了？”贾芸道：“妹妹生得好相貌，将来又是个有大造化的。”巧姐儿回头把贾芸一瞧，又哭起来，叠连几次。贾芸看这光景坐不住，便起身告辞要走。凤姐道：“你把东西带了去罢。”贾芸道：“这一点子，婶娘还不赏脸？”凤姐道：“你不带去，我便叫人送到你家去。芸哥儿，你不要这么着。你又不是外人。我这里有机会，少不得打发人去叫你没有事也没法儿，不在乎这些东东西西上的。”贾芸看见凤姐执意不受，只得红着脸道：“既这么着，我再找得用的东西来孝敬婶娘罢。”凤姐儿便叫小红：“拿了东西，跟着送出芸哥去。”\n　　贾芸走着，一面心中想道：“人说二奶奶利害，果然利害。一点儿都不漏缝，真正斩钉截铁！怪不得没有后世。这巧姐儿更怪，见了我好象前世的冤家似的。真正晦气，白闹了这么一天。”小红见贾芸没得彩头，也不高兴，拿着东西跟出来。贾芸接过来，打开包儿，拣了两件，悄悄的递给小红。小红不接，嘴里说道：“二爷别这么着。看奶奶知道了，大家倒不好看。”贾芸道：“你好生收着罢。怕什么，那里就知道了呢？你若不要，就是瞧不起我了。”小红微微一笑，才接过来，说道：“谁要你这些东西，算什么呢？”说了这句话，把脸又飞红了。贾芸也笑道：“我也不是为东西。况且那东西也算不了什么。”说着话儿，两个已走到二门口。贾芸把下剩的仍旧揣在怀内。小红催着贾芸道：“你先去罢。有什么事情只管来找我。我如今在这院里了，又不隔手。”贾芸点点头儿，说道：“二奶奶太利害，我可惜不能常来！刚才我说的话，你横竖心里明白，得了空儿再告诉你罢。”小红满脸羞红，说道：“你去罢。明儿也常来走走。谁叫你和他生疏呢？”贾芸道：“知道了。”贾芸说着，出了院门。这里小红站在门口，怔怔的看他去远了，才回来了。\n　　却说凤姐在屋里吩咐预备晚饭，因又问道：“你们熬了粥了没有？”丫鬟们连忙去问，回来回道：“预备了。”凤姐道：“你们把那南边来的糟东西弄一两碟来罢。”秋桐答应了，叫丫头们伺候。平儿走来笑道：“我倒忘了，今儿晌午，奶奶在上头老太太那边的时候，水月庵的师父打发人来，要向奶奶讨两瓶南小菜，还要支用几个月的月钱，说是身上不受用。我问那道婆来着：‘师父怎么不受用？’他说：‘四五天了。前儿夜里，因那些小沙弥小道士里头有几个女孩子，睡觉没有吹灯，他说了几次不听。那一夜，看见他们三更以后灯还点着呢。他便叫他们吹灯。个个都睡着了，没有人答应，只得自己亲自起来给他们吹灭了。回到炕上，只见有两个人，一男一女，坐在炕上。他赶着问是谁，那里把一根绳子往他脖子上一套，他便叫起人来。众人听见，点上灯火，一齐赶来，已经躺在地下，满口吐白沫子。幸亏救醒了。此时还不能吃东西，所以叫来寻些小菜儿的。’我因奶奶不在屋里，不便给他。我说：‘奶奶此时没有空儿，在上头呢，回来告诉。’便打发他回去了。刚才听见说起南菜，方想起来了，不然就忘了。”凤姐听了，呆了一呆，说道：“南莱不是还有呢，叫人送些去就是了。那银子，过一天芹哥来领就是了。”又见小红进来会道：“刚才二爷差人来，说是今晚城外有事，不能回来，先通知一声。”凤姐道：“是了。”\n　　说着，只听见小丫头从后面喘吁吁的嚷着，直跑到院子里来。外面平儿接着，还有几个丫头们，咕咕唧唧的说话。凤姐道：“你们说什么呢？”平儿道：“小丫头子有些胆怯，说鬼话。”凤姐说：“那一个？”小丫头进来。问道：“什么鬼话？”那丫头道：“我刚才到后边去叫打杂儿的添煤，只听得三间空屋子里哗喇哗喇的响，我还道是猫儿耗子又听得嗳的一声，象个人出气儿的似的。我害怕，就跑回来了。”凤姐骂道：“胡说，我这里断不兴说神说鬼。我从来不信这些个话，快滚出去罢！”那小丫头出去了。凤姐便叫彩明将一天零碎日用账对过一遍。时已将近二更，大家又歇了一回，略说些闲话，遂叫各人安歇去罢。凤姐也睡下了。\n　　将近三更，凤姐似睡不睡，觉得身上寒毛一乍，自己惊醒了，越躺着越发起碜来，因叫平儿秋桐过来作伴。二人也不解何意。那秋桐本来不顺凤姐，后来贾琏因尤二姐之事不大爱惜他了，凤姐又笼络他，如今倒也安静，只是心里比平儿差多了，外面情儿。今见凤姐不受用，只得端上茶来。凤姐喝了一口道：“难为你，睡去罢，只留平儿在这里就够了。”秋桐却要献勤儿，因说道：“奶奶睡不着，倒是我们两个轮流坐坐也使得。”凤姐一面说，一面睡着了。\n平儿秋桐看见凤姐已睡，只听得远远的鸡声叫了，二人方都穿着衣裳略躺了一躺，就天亮了，连忙起来伏侍凤姐梳洗。凤姐因夜中之事一心神恍惚不宁，只是一味要强，仍然扎挣起来。正坐着纳闷，忽听个小丫头子在院里问道：“平姑娘在屋里么？”平儿答应了一声。那小丫头掀起帘子进来，却是王夫人打发过来来找贾琏，说：“外头有人回要紧的官事。老爷才出了门，太太叫快请二爷过去呢。”凤姐听见，唬了一跳。\n未知何事，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Xichun was studying a handbook of chess problems when she heard someone in the courtyard call for Caiping. She recognized Yuanyang’s voice and presently Caiping ushered her in, accompanied by a young maid carrying a small yellow silk package.\n\n“What is it?” asked Xichun with a smile.\n\n“Our Old Lady will be eighty-one next year,” Yuanyang told her. “That’s a critical year with a ‘hidden nine.’ So she has vowed to have the Diamond Sutra copied 3,651 times as an act of merit, and this has already been given out to professional scribes. But as the common saying goes, the Diamond Sutra is only the amulet’s casing, whereas the Heart Sutra is its core. So to gain more merit the Diamond Sutra must incorporate the Heart Sutra. The old lady considers the Heart Sutra even more important, and as the Bodhisattva Guanyin is a goddess, she wants some of the ladies and young mistresses in the family to copy it out 365 times — that would be more pious and pure. Apart from Madam Lian, who has no time as she’s in charge and can’t write anyway, all the others who can write, no matter how much, have been given this task — even Madam You and the concubines in the East Mansion, not to say the ladies in our own house.”\n\nXichun nodded. “There’s nothing else I can do, but I have the greatest faith in copying sutras. Put that down and have some tea.”\n\nYuanyang put the package on the table and sat down while Caiping poured her some tea.\n\n“Aren’t you going to do some copying?” Xichun asked Yuanyang.\n\n“You’re joking again, miss. It wasn’t so bad a few years ago, but have you seen me hold a brush these last three or four years?”\n\n“This would gain you merit.”\n\n“I have my own way. Every evening, after waiting on the old lady till she’s asleep, I recite the name of Buddha over grains of rice. I’ve been doing this for more than three years now, and I’m keeping this rice to add to the offerings when the old lady has masses said. That will be my humble tribute.”\n\n“In that case, if the old lady’s the Goddess of Mercy, you must be the Dragon Princess.”\n\n“How could I presume to aspire to that? Still, I couldn’t serve anyone else — I don’t know what karma it is from my past life.”\n\nShe rose to go and told her maid to open the package.\n\n“This white paper is for copying the Heart Sutra,” she said. Then picking up a bundle of Tibetan incense she added, “Light this while you’re writing.”\n\nXichun agreed to do this.\n\nYuanyang took her leave then and went back with her maid to the Lady Dowager’s apartments to report. She found the old lady playing backgammon with Li Wan, and stood watching. Li Wan had good dice. With one throw she captured several of the old lady’s pieces, which made Yuanyang pucker up her lips to hide a smile.\n\nJust then Baoyu came in with two small cricket-cages of fine bamboo workmanship.\n\n“I heard that the old lady can’t sleep at night,” he said. “So I’ve brought these to amuse her.”\n\n“Don’t think you can run wild just because your father’s away from home,” she scolded.\n\n“I’m not running wild.”\n\n“If you aren’t, why aren’t you studying in the schoolroom instead of playing with such things?”\n\n“I didn’t buy them. Today the tutor told Huan and Lan to compose couplets. Huan couldn’t, so I prompted him quietly. When he gave the answer the tutor was pleased and praised him. To show his gratitude he bought me these, and I’ve brought them for you, madam.”\n\n“Shouldn’t he study every day? Why couldn’t he answer? If he can’t, your Uncle Dairu should slap his face to shame him. You deserve a slap too, for giving him the answer.\n\nWhen your father was at home he was scared out of his wits whenever he was told to write poetry. But now you talk big. And as for that wretched Huan, he’s even more worthless. After getting someone else to do a poem for him, he tried to bribe people to keep quiet. Fancy such young children carrying on in such a hole-and-corner way. For shame! Who knows what they’ll grow up into?” This set the whole room laughing.\n\n“Did young Lan finish his verses?” asked the Lady Dowager. “Huan ought to have helped him as he’s the younger.”\n\n“He didn’t need any help, he did it by himself,” Baoyu answered.\n\n“I don’t believe it,” retorted his grandmother. “You must have been up to your tricks again. You’re getting quite above yourself, like a camel in a flock of sheep — you’re the big one it seems! So now you can write compositions too.”\n\n“He really did it by himself,” Baoyu assured her. “The tutor even said that he’s sure to do well in future. If you don’t believe it, madam, you can send for him to come and test him.”\n\n“If that’s true, of course I’m pleased. I was only afraid you were telling lies. If he did it himself, the child may get on after all.” She turned to Li Wan. “Well, your elder brother didn’t die in vain, and you haven’t toiled in vain all these years bringing him up. He’ll be able to carry on the family tradition.” At this point she broke down and wept.\n\nLi Wan was touched too, but as the old lady was upset she controlled herself to say cheerfully, “It’s thanks to your virtue, madam, that we’re enjoying your good fortune. If he lives up to your expectations, that will be our good luck. You should be happy, madam, instead of grieving.”\n\nShe turned then to Baoyu. “Don’t praise him so highly in future, uncle. He’s only a child. What does he know? You mean well, but he may not understand and grow conceited and stop trying to improve.”\n\n“Your sister-in-law is quite right,” agreed the Lady Dowager. “We mustn’t put too much pressure on him while he’s so young. If we push him too hard he may fall ill, and then all his studies will go by the board and all your efforts will be wasted.” At this point Li Wan could not hold back her tears, but she hastily wiped them away.\n\nJust then Jia Huan and Jia Lan came in to pay their respects to the Lady Dowager. Jia Lan also greeted his mother, then went to stand by the old lady’s side.\n\n“I heard your uncle say that you made a good couplet and your tutor praised you,” she said.\n\nJia Lan simply smiled without answering.\n\nYuanyang came over to announce, “Madam, dinner is served.”\n\n“Ask Aunt Xue to join us,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\nPohu sent a maid to Lady Wang’s quarters to invite Aunt Xue. Baoyu and Jia Huan withdrew then, while Suyun and some young maids cleared away the backgammon board. Li Wan waited on the Lady Dowager during the meal, and Jia Lan stood by his mother.\n\n“You two can dine with me,” said the old lady, and Li Wan assented.\n\nSoon the table was laid. Then a maid came in to report, “Her Ladyship says that Aunt Xue has been coming and going the last few days, so she won’t be joining you, madam. After dinner she went home.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager made Jia Lan sit beside her then, and they started their meal. But we need not dwell on such details.\n\nAfter dinner the old lady washed and rinsed her mouth, then lay on the couch to chat. A young maid came in to whisper to Pohu, who stepped forward to announce, “The Elder Master of the East Mansion has come to pay his respects.”\n\nAfter all the running about she’s had managing the household, she should rest. I’ll see to this.” The maid told the old women this, and they passed on the message to Jia Zhen, who then withdrew.\n\nThe next day he came back to attend to business. The pages at the gate reported several matters to him, and one announced, “The chief tenant has sent some fruit.”\n\n“Where is the list?” asked Jia Zhen.\n\nThe page promptly handed it to him. He saw that it was just a list of fresh fruit, including also some vegetables and game.\n\n“Who usually takes charge of this?” he asked.\n\n“Zhou Rui,” the gatemen told him.\n\nHe sent for Zhou Rui and ordered, “Check these according to the list and take them to the inner court. I’ll make a copy of this list to check against later.” He added, “Tell the kitchen to add a few extra dishes for the men who brought the fruit, and give them the usual tip and meal.”\n\nZhou Rui assented. He ordered the fruit to be carried to Xifeng’s courtyard and made a clear report to her of the estate’s accounts and the fruit. Then going out for a while, he came back to ask Jia Zhen, “Did you check the number of fruit just brought, sir?”\n\n“How do I have time to do that?” retorted Jia Zhen. “I gave you the list, just check accordingly.”\n\n“I have checked, sir. There’s neither too little nor too much. Since you’ve kept a copy, why not ask the men who brought the fruit whether this account is correct or not?”\n\n“What do you mean?” fumed Jia Zhen. “It’s only some fruit, what does it matter? It’s not that I suspect you.”\n\nAs he was speaking, Bao Er came in and kowtowed.\n\n“Please let me go back to my old job of serving outside, sir,” he begged.\n\n“Now what’s the matter?” asked Jia Zhen.\n\n“I’ve no say in things here.”\n\n“Who asked you to speak up?”\n\n“Why should I stay here just as a spy?”\n\nZhou Rui put in, “When I’m in charge of the rent and income from the estates, the sum involved every year is three to five hundred thousand taels, yet never have the master, the mistresses or the young mistresses questioned me; so why should they over a few trifles like this? If Bao Er is to be believed, then all the family’s land and property must have been misappropriated by us slaves.”\n\nJia Zhen thought, “Since Bao Er has been making trouble here, I may as well send him away.”\n\n“Get out!” he ordered.\n\nTo Zhou Rui he said, “Don’t say any more, just get on with your work.”\n\nThe two of them went off different ways.\n\nJia Zhen was resting in his study when he heard an uproar at the gate and sent to find out what was happening. The man came back to report, “Bao Er is fighting with Zhou Rui’s adopted son.”\n\n“Who is Zhou Rui’s adopted son?” asked Jia Zhen.\n\n“He’s called He San, a worthless fellow who stays at home all day drinking and making trouble. He’s often here sitting at the gate. When he heard Bao Er and Zhou Rui quarrelling, he joined in.”\n\n“The scoundrel!” cried Jia Zhen. “Tie up both Bao Er and that He San for me. Where is Zhou Rui?”\n\n“He left before the fighting started.”\n\n“Bring him here. This is outrageous!” The servants assented.\n\nIn the midst of this excitement Jia Lian came back, and Jia Zhen told him what had happened.\n\n“This is monstrous!” exclaimed Jia Lian, and sent more men to arrest Zhou Rui. Knowing that he could not escape, Zhou Rui turned up too.\n\n“Tie him up as well!” ordered Jia Zhen.\n\nJia Lian said to Zhou Rui, “You’d had words before, but that didn’t matter. The master straightened things out, so why did you have to start a brawl outside? Fighting is bad enough, but to get that bastard He San to make trouble too! Can’t you keep your men in hand?”\n\nSo saying, he gave Zhou Rui several kicks.  \n“It’s no use just beating Zhou Rui,” said Jia Zhen.  \n\nHe ordered his men to give Bao Er and He San fifty lashes each, then have them thrown out. After that he and Jia Lian discussed their business.  \n\nThe servants, talking behind their backs, had plenty to say on the subject. Some accused Jia Zhen of shielding his own household; others said he was no peace-maker; others again commented that he was no better himself.  \n\n“Wasn’t it he who got Bao Er to work for Master Lian after the ugly business of the You sisters? Now he’s not satisfied with Bao Er — that means Bao Er’s wife is no longer looking after him properly.”  \n\nSuch were the diverse views expressed.  \n\nSince Jia Zheng had become a secretary in the Board of Works, many of his servants had made money. When Jia Yun heard this, he wanted to get in on it too. He made a deal with some foremen outside, promising them a percentage, then bought some fashionable embroideries as a bribe for Xifeng.  \n\nXifeng was at home when her maids reported, “The Elder and Second Masters are in a temper and are beating men outside.”  \n\nWondering what had happened, she was on the point of sending to ask when Jia Lian came in and told her the whole story.  \n\n“This isn’t important,” said Xifeng. “But we mustn’t let this custom grow. Though our house is still prosperous, they’re starting to fight. When the younger generation take charge, they’ll be even harder to control. The year before last, in the East Mansion, I saw Jiao Da dead drunk, lying below the steps and cursing. He swore right and left, not caring whom he was insulting. Even if he has done some good in his time, there should be some respect for the distinction between master and servant. I don’t like to say it, but Madam You is too weak. She’s let them all get completely out of hand. Now there’s this fellow Bao Er. I hear he was recommended by you and Lord Zhen, so why are you beating him today?”  \n\nJia Lian felt this as a stab. Sheepishly he changed the subject, then left on the pretext of business.  \n\nXiao Hong came in then to announce, “Master Yun is outside, madam, asking to see you.”  \n\n“What does he want this time?” wondered Xifeng. “Show him in,” she said.  \n\nXiao Hong went out and smiled at Jia Yun, who quickly stepped forward to ask, “Did you announce me, miss?”  \n\nShe blushed. “What a lot you ask!”  \n\n“How often do I trouble you? It’s only because that year you were in Uncle Bao’s rooms that I....”  \n\nAfraid someone might come along and see them, she cut him short to ask, “Did you get that handkerchief I gave you that year?”  \n\nJia Yun was overjoyed by this question. He was starting to speak when a young maid appeared from the inner apartments. He promptly accompanied Xiao Hong inside. Walking a little way apart, he whispered to her, “When I leave, see me out. I’ve something funny to tell you.”  \n\nShe flushed and shot him a glance but made no answer. When they reached Xifeng’s door she went in first to announce him, then came out to raise the portiere and beckon him in, saying for form’s sake:  \n\n“The mistress invites you in, Master Yun.”  \n\nHe smiled and followed her in. Having paid his respects to Xifeng he said, “My mother sends her compliments.”  \n\nXifeng inquired after his mother, then asked, “What brings you here?”  \n\n“I’m always thinking how good you were to me in the past, aunt, and feeling bad that I’ve never shown my gratitude.\n\n\"I'm not going. I'd like to offer you a little present, aunt, but I'm afraid you may suspect my motives. As the Double Ninth Festival is near, I've brought you some trifles. Not that you haven't everything here already; this is just a small token of my respect. But I'm afraid you may not deign to accept it.\"\n\nXifeng smiled. \"Sit down and tell me what's on your mind,\" she said.\n\nOnly then did Jia Yun take a seat, deferentially placing his presents on a table by his side.\n\n\"You're not too well off,\" she continued. \"Why go spending your money? I've no need of anything. You must have some reason for coming today, so out with it.\"\n\n\"I've no ulterior motive,\" he assured her. \"I just felt uncomfortable because I'm so indebted to you for your kindness.\" He smiled slightly.\n\n\"Don't talk like that. I know how hard up you are. Why should I accept something for nothing? If you want me to take this, you must tell me what it's for. If you beat about the bush like this, I won't accept it.\"\n\nAt that Jia Yun had to stand up. \"Well, since you're so kind,\" he said with a smile, \"I will speak frankly. I've no wild ideas, but a few days ago I heard that the master is in charge of the construction of a mausoleum. I have some friends who've managed several big projects very competently, and I'd like you to put in a word for me with the master. If I get one or two contracts, aunt, I shall never forget your goodness. And if there's any way I can serve you in the house, I'll do my very best for you too.\"\n\n\"If it were anything else, I could decide,\" replied Xifeng. \"But in official business, the higher-ups decide everything and the clerks and runners below carry out their orders; no one else can get a word in. Even our own servants just wait on the master. Your Uncle Lian only goes to the yamen on family business, he has no say in official matters either. In family affairs, if you attend to one thing you neglect another. Even Master Zhen can't keep everything under control. Besides, you're young and only a junior. How could you cope with such people? Anyway, there's practically nothing doing now in the yamen, it's just a matter of drawing pay and hanging around. Can't you find something to do at home? Do you have to have that job? I'm telling you the truth. Go home and think it over, and you'll see I'm right. I appreciate your kind thought, but you'd better take these things back. Wherever you got them, return them to the same place.\"\n\nAs she was speaking Nanny Liu came in with Qiaojie. The little girl, gaily dressed and holding some toys, ran up to her mother to show her what she had. At once Jia Yun rose to his feet.\n\n\"So this is my little cousin!\" he beamed. \"What pretty things you have!\"\n\nQiaojie burst out crying at the sight of this stranger. He promptly stepped back.\n\n\"There's a good girl, don't be afraid,\" said Xifeng, taking the child in her arms. \"This is your Cousin Yun. Why are you so shy?\"\n\nJia Yun commented, \"My little cousin takes after you, aunt. She's going to have a great future.\"\n\nBut when Qiaojie turned to look at him again, she went on crying. After this happened several times, Jia Yun, feeling rather uncomfortable, stood up to take his leave.\n\n\"Take your things with you,\" Xifeng told him.\n\n\"Won't you do me the honour of accepting them, aunt?\"\n\n\"If you don't take them, I shall have them sent to your home. Don't carry on like this, Yun. You're one of the family. If I hear of any opening, of course I'll send to let you know. But there's nothing doing at present. It doesn't depend on these presents.\"\n\nSeeing that she was adamant, Jia Yun had to say with a blush, \"In that case, I'll find you something you can use.\"\n\n\"Please accept these, Auntie, to show my respect.\" Xifeng told Crimson: \"Take these things and see Master Yun out.\"\n\nAs Jia Yun left he was thinking, \"They say Madam Lian is formidable, and indeed she is. She never puts a foot wrong, and is absolutely resolute. No wonder she has no son. And that Qiaojie is odder still. She treats me as if I'd been her enemy in some past life. What bad luck, wasting a whole day for nothing.\" Crimson, seeing that he had gained nothing, was out of sorts too. She took the things and followed him out. He took them from her, opened the package, selected two items and slipped them to her. She refused them.\n\n\"Don't do that, sir,\" she said. \"If the mistress found out, it would be so awkward.\"\n\n\"Just take them,\" he urged. \"What are you afraid of? How can she find out? If you won't accept them, that means you look down on me.\"\n\nCrimson smiled and took them.\n\n\"Who wants your things?\" she pouted. \"What are they anyway?\" As she said this she blushed.\n\nJia Yun smiled too. \"It's not for the things' sake either. Besides, they're nothing much.\"\n\nBy now they had reached the inner gate. He tucked the rest of the things back in his pocket.\n\n\"You go on now,\" said Crimson. \"If you want anything, just come and find me. I'm in this compound now, so it's no trouble.\"\n\nJia Yun nodded. \"Madam Lian is too formidable. It's a pity I can't call often. But you know what I meant just now. I'll explain next time I have a chance.\"\n\n\"Go along with you,\" she said, blushing. \"Come again tomorrow. Why be so distant?\"\n\n\"All right,\" he promised.\n\nHe left then, and Crimson stood watching at the gate until he was out of sight before going back.\n\nXifeng, having given orders for the evening meal, asked, \"Have you prepared the congee?\"\n\nThe maids hastily went to ask and reported back, \"Yes, it's ready.\"\n\n\"Then bring a couple of side-dishes of those southern pickles,\" said Xifeng.\n\nQiutong assented and told the younger maids to fetch them.\n\nPing'er came in then and announced with a smile, \"I'd forgotten this, but at noon today, madam, while you were with the old lady, a nun from Water Moon Convent sent to ask you for two bottles of southern pickles and to request a few months' allowance in advance, as she's been unwell. I asked the woman who brought the message what ailed the nun. She said, 'She's been poorly for four or five days. The other night, because some of the novices hadn't put out their lamp when they went to sleep and she'd told them several times to no purpose, at the third watch she saw their light still burning. She called to them to put it out, but they were all asleep and didn't answer, so she had to get up and put it out herself. But when she lay down again, she saw a man and a woman sitting on the kang. She asked who they were, but a rope was flung round her neck and she started calling for help. The others heard and came with a light to find her lying on the floor, frothing at the mouth. Luckily they brought her round; but she still can't take any food, that's why she's sent for some pickles.' As you weren't here, madam, I didn't like to give her any. I said, 'The mistress is busy with the old lady. I'll tell her when she comes back.' Then I sent the woman away. It was only when you mentioned southern pickles that I remembered this, otherwise I'd have forgotten it.\"\n\nXifeng was rather taken aback.\n\n\"Is there still some southern pickle left?\" she asked. \"Send her some. As for the silver, the day after tomorrow, when Master Qin comes, give him some to take to her.\"\n\n“I see,” said Xifeng.\n\nJust then Little Hong came in to report, “The master has sent a man to say that he has business outside the city and won’t be able to come back tonight. He asked me to let you know.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nXifeng heard a young maid shouting breathlessly as she ran into the courtyard from the back. Pinger and some other maids outside were whispering together.\n\n“What are you talking about?” asked Xifeng.\n\n“One of the young maids is scared and talking nonsense,” Pinger told her.\n\n“Which one?” The maid came in and Xifeng asked, “What nonsense?”\n\n“I’d just gone back to tell the cleaners to put more coal on the stove when I heard a crashing noise from those three empty rooms. I thought it was the cat after a mouse, but then I heard a sound like someone sighing. It frightened me so much, I ran back.”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense!” scolded Xifeng. “We don’t hold with talk of spirits here. I’ve never believed such stories. Get along with you, quick!”\n\nWhen the maid had gone she told Caiming to check the day’s accounts. By now it was nearly the second watch, so after a little more talk they all went to bed and Xifeng turned in too.\n\nAs the third watch approached she was sleeping fitfully when a sudden chill made her shiver and wake up. The longer she lay there the more uneasy she felt, until she called Pinger and Qiutong to keep her company. Neither could understand why. Qiutong had formerly been hostile to Xifeng; but after Jia Lian’s ill-treatment of her on account of Second Sister, Xifeng had won her over and now she was quite submissive, though not as devoted as Pinger. Seeing Xifeng unwell, she brought her some tea.\n\nXifeng took a sip. “Don’t trouble,” she said. “You can go back to sleep. I just want Pinger here.”\n\nBut Qiutong wanted to show her zeal. “If you can’t sleep, madam, we can take it in turns to sit with you,” she offered.\n\nEven as she spoke Xifeng dozed off again. Seeing this, Pinger and Qiutong dozed in their clothes too until the distant crowing of cocks heralded dawn and they got up quickly to help Xifeng wash and dress. Although still upset by the night’s happenings, Xifening as usual put on a bold front and forced herself to get up.\n\nShe was sitting there in a daze when a young maid asked in the courtyard, “Is Miss Ping here?”\n\nPinger answered and lifted the portiere to see one of Lady Wang’s maids, who had come to fetch Jia Lian.\n\n“Some messengers have come with important official business,” she said. “The master’s just gone out. Her Ladyship wants the second master to go over quickly.”\n\nXifeng was consternated.\n\nTo know what ensued, read the next chapter."
