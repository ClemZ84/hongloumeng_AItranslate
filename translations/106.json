  "original": "话说贾政闻知贾母危急，即忙进去看视。见贾母惊吓气逆，王夫人、鸳鸯等唤醒回来，即用疏气安神的丸药服了，渐渐的好些，只是伤心落泪。贾政在旁劝慰，总说：“是儿子们不肖，招了祸来，累老太太受惊。若老太太宽慰些，儿子们尚可在外料理；若是老太太有什么不自在，儿子们的罪孽更重了。”贾母道：“我活了八十多岁，自作女孩儿起，到你父亲手里，都托着祖宗的福，从没有听见过这些事。如今到老了，见你们倘或受罪，叫我心里过的去吗？倒不如合上眼随你们去罢了。”说着又哭。\n　　贾政此时着急异常，又听外面说：“请老爷，内廷有信。”贾政急忙出来，见是北静王府长史，一见面便说：“大喜！”贾政谢了，请长史坐下，请问：“王爷有何谕旨？”那长史道：“我们王爷同西平郡王进内复奏，将大人俱怕之心，感激天恩之语，都代奏过了。主上甚是悯恤，并念及贵妃溘逝未久，不忍加罪，着加恩仍在工部员外上行走。所封家产，惟将贾赦的入官，馀俱给还，并传旨令尽心供职。惟抄出借券，令我们王爷查核。如有违禁重利的，一概照例入官，其在定例生息的，同房地文书，尽行给还。贾琏着革去职衔，免罪释放。”贾政听毕，即起身叩谢天恩，又拜谢王爷恩典：“先请长史大人代为禀谢，明晨到阙谢恩，并到府里磕头。”那长史去了。少停，传出旨来，承办官遵旨一一查清，入官者入官，给还者给还。将贾琏放出，所有贾赦名下男妇人等造册入官。\n　　可怜贾琏屋内东西，除将按例放出的文书发给外，其馀虽未尽入官的，早被查抄的人尽行抢去，所存者只有家伙物件。贾琏始则惧罪，后蒙释放，已是大幸，及想起历年积聚的东西并凤姐的体己，不下五七万金，一朝而尽，怎得不疼。且他父亲现禁在锦衣府，凤姐病在垂危，一时悲痛。又见贾政含泪叫他，问道：“我因官事在身，不大理家，故叫你们夫妇总理家事。你父亲所为固难谏劝，那重利盘剥究竟是谁干的？况且非咱们这样人家所为。如今入了官，在银钱呢是不打紧的，这声名出去还了得吗？”贾琏跪下说道：“侄儿办家事，并不敢存一点私心，所有出入的账目，自有赖大、吴新登、戴良等登记，老爷只管叫他们来查问。现在这几年，库内的银子出多入少，虽没贴补在内，已在各处做了好些空头，求老爷问太太就知道了。这些放出去的账，连侄儿也不知道那里的银子，要问周瑞、旺儿才知道。”贾政道：“据你说来，连你自己屋里的事还不知道，那些家中上下的事更不知道了！我这会子也不查问你，现今你无事的人，你父亲的事和你珍大哥有事，还不快去打听打听吗？”贾琏一心委屈，含着眼泪，答应了出去。\n　　贾政连连叹气，想道：“我祖父勤劳王事，立下功勋，得了两个世职，如今两房犯事，都革去了。我瞧这些子侄没一个长进的。老天哪，老天哪！我贾家何至一败如此！我虽蒙圣恩格外垂慈，给还家产，那两处食用自应归并一处，叫我一人那里支撑的往？方才琏儿所说，更加诧异，说不但库上无银，而且尚有亏空，这几年竟是虚名在外。只恨我自己为什么糊涂若此？倘或我珠儿在世，尚有膀臂；宝玉虽大，更是无用之物。”想到那里不觉泪满衣襟。又想：“老太太若大年纪，儿子们并没奉养一日，反累他老人家吓得死去活来，种种罪孽，叫我委之何人？”正在独自悲切，只见家人禀报：“各亲友进来看候。”贾政一一道谢，说起“家门不幸，是我不能管教了侄，所以至此。”有的说：“我久知令兄赦大老爷行事不妥，那边珍爷更加骄纵。若说因官事错误得个不是，于心无愧；如今自己闹出的，倒带累了二老爷。”有的说：“人家闹的也多，也没见御史参奏。不是珍老大得罪朋友，何至如此。”有的说：“也不怪御史，我们听说是府上的家人同几个泥腿在外头哄嚷出来的。御史恐参奏不实，所以诓了这里的人去，才说出来的。我想府上待下人最宽的，为什么还有这事？”有的说：“大凡奴才们是一个养活不得的。今儿在这里都是好亲友，我才敢说。就是尊驾在外任，我保不得你是不爱钱的，那外主头的风声也不好，都是奴才们闹的，你该提防些。如今虽说没有动你的家，倘或再遇着主上疑心起来，好些不便呢。”贾政听说，心下着忙道：“众位听见我的风声怎样？”众人道：“我们虽没见实据，只听得外头人说你在粮道任上，怎么叫门上家人要钱。”贾政听了，便说道：“我这是对天可表的，从不敢起这个念头。只是奴才们在外头招摇撞骗，闹出事来，我就耽不起。”众人道：“如今怕也无益，只好将现在的管家们都严严的查一查，若有抗主的奴才，查出来严严的办一办也罢了。”\n　　贾政听了点头。便见门上的进来回说：“孙姑爷打发人来说，自己有事不能来，着人来瞧瞧。说大老爷该他一项银子，要在二老爷身上还的。”贾政心内忧闷，只说：“知道了。”众人都冷笑道：“人说令亲孙绍祖混账，果然有的。如今丈人抄了家，不但不来瞧看帮补，倒赶忙的来要银子，真真不在理上。”贾政道：“如今且不必说他，那头亲事原是家兄配错了的。我的侄女儿的罪已经受够了，如今又找上我来了。”正说着，只见薛蝌进来说道：“我打听锦衣府赵堂官必要照御史参的办，只怕大老爷和珍大爷吃不住。”众人都道：“二老爷，还是得你出去求求王爷，怎么挽回挽回才好。不然，这两家子就完了。”贾政答应致谢，众人都散。\n　　那时天已点灯时候，贾政进去请贾母的安，见贾母略略好些。回到自己房中，埋怨贾琏夫妇不知好歹，如今闹出放账的事情，大家不好，心里很不受用。只是凤姐现在病重，况他所有的什物尽被抄抢，心内自然难受，一时也未便说他，暂且隐忍不言。一夜无话。次早贾政进内谢恩，并到北静王府西平王府两处叩谢，求二位王爷照应他哥哥侄儿。二王应许。贾政又在同寅相好处托情。\n　　且说贾琏打听得父兄之事不大妥，无法可施，只得回到家中。平儿守着凤姐哭泣，秋桐在耳房里抱怨凤姐。贾琏走到旁边，见凤姐奄奄一息，就有多少怨言，一时也说不出来。平儿哭道：“如今已经这样，东西去了不能复来；奶奶这样，还得再请个大夫瞧瞧才好啊。”贾琏啐道：“呸！我的性命还不保，我还管他呢！”凤姐听见，睁眼一瞧，虽不言语，那眼泪直流。看见贾琏出去了，便和平儿道：“你别不达时务了。到了这个田地，你还顾我做什么？我巴不得今儿就死才好。只要你能够眼里有我，我死后你抚养大了巧姐儿，我在阴司里也感激你的情。”平儿听了，越发抽抽搭搭的哭起来了。凤姐道：“你也不糊涂。他们虽没有来说，必是抱怨我的。虽说事是外头闹起，我不放账，也没我的事。如今枉费心计，挣了一辈子的强，偏偏儿的落在人后头了！我还恍惚听见珍大爷的事，说是强占良民妻子为妾，不从逼死，有个姓张的在里头，你想想还有谁呢？要是这件事审出来，咱们二爷是脱不了的，我那时候儿可怎么见人呢？我要立刻就死，又耽不起吞金服毒的。你还要请大夫，这不是你疼我，反倒害了我了么？”平儿愈听愈惨，想来实在难处，恐凤姐自寻短见，只得紧紧守着。\n　 幸贾母不知底细，因近日身子好些，又见贾政无事，宝玉、宝钗在旁，天天不离左右，略觉放心。素来最疼凤姐，便叫鸳鸯：“将我的体己东西拿些给凤丫头，再拿些银钱交给平儿，好好的伏侍好了凤丫头，我再慢慢的分派。”又命王夫人照看邢夫人。此时宁国府第入官，所有财产房地等项并家奴等俱已造册收尽。这里贾母命人将车接了尤氏婆媳过来。可惜赫赫宁府，只剩得他们婆媳两个并佩凤偕鸾二人，连一个下人没有。贾母指出房子一所居住，就在惜春所住的间壁，又派了婆子四人、丫头两个伏侍。一应饭食起居在大厨房内分送，衣裙什物又是贾母送去，零星需用亦在账房内开销，俱照荣府每人月例之数。那贾赦、贾珍、贾蓉在锦衣府使用，账房内实在无项可支。如今凤姐儿一无所有，贾琏外头债务满身。贾政不知家务，只说：“已经托人，自有照应。”贾琏无计可施，想到那亲戚里头，薛姨妈家已败，王子腾已死，馀者亲戚虽有，俱是不能照应的，只得暗暗差人下屯，将地亩暂卖数千金作为监中使费。贾琏如此一行，那些家奴见主家势败，也使趁此弄鬼，并将东庄租税也就指名借用些。此是后话，暂且不提。\n　　且说贾母见祖宗世职革去，现在子孙在监质审，邢夫人、尤氏等日夜啼哭，凤姐病在垂危，虽有宝玉、宝钗在侧，只可解劝，不能分忧，所以日夜不宁，思前想后，眼泪不干。一日傍晚，叫宝玉回去，自己扎挣坐起，叫鸳鸯等各处佛堂上香，又命自己院内焚起斗香，用拐拄着，出到院中。琥珀知是老太太拜佛，铺下大红猩毡拜垫。贾母上香跪下，磕了好些头，念了一回佛，含泪祝告天地道：“皇天菩萨在上，我贾门史氏，虔诚祷告，求菩萨慈悲。我贾门数世以来，不敢行凶霸道。我帮夫助子，虽不能为善，也不敢作恶。必是后辈儿孙骄奢淫佚，暴殄天物，以致合府抄检。现在儿孙监禁，自然凶多吉少，皆由我一人罪孽，不教儿孙，所以至此。我今叩求皇天保佑，在监的逢凶化吉，有病的早早安身。总有合家罪孽，情愿一人承当，求饶恕儿孙。若皇天怜念我虔诚，早早赐我一死，宽免儿孙之罪！”默默说到此处，不禁伤心，呜呜咽咽的哭泣起来。鸳鸯珍珠一面解劝，一面扶进房去。\n　　只见王夫人带了宝玉宝钗过来请晚安，见贾母伤悲，三人也大哭起来。宝钗更有一层苦楚：想哥哥也在外监，将来要处决，不知可能减等；公婆虽然无事，眼见家业萧条；宝玉依然疯傻，毫无志气。想到后来终身，更比贾母王夫人哭的悲痛。宝玉见宝钗如此，他也有一番悲戚，想着：“老太太年老不得安心，老爷太太见此光景，不免悲伤，众姐妹风流云散，一日少似一日。追思园中吟诗起社，何等热闹；自林妹妹一死，我郁闷到今，又有宝姐姐伴着，不便时常哭泣。况他又忧兄思母，日夜难得笑容。今日看他悲哀欲绝，心里更加不忍。”竟嚎啕大哭起来。鸳鸯、彩云、莺儿、袭人看着，也各有所思，便都抽抽搭搭的。馀者丫头们看的伤心，不觉也都哭了。竟无人劝。满屋中哭声惊天动地，将外头上夜婆子吓慌，急报于贾政知道。那贾政正在书房纳闷，听见贾母的人来报，心中着忙，飞奔进内。远远听得哭声甚众，打量老太太不好，急的魂魄俱丧。疾忙进来，只见坐着悲啼，才放下心来，便道：“老太太伤心，你们该劝解才是啊，怎么打伙儿哭起来了？”众人这才急忙止哭，大家对面发怔。贾政上前安慰了老太太，又说了众人几句。都心里想道：“我们原怕老太太悲伤，所以来劝解，怎么忘情，大家痛哭起来？”\n　　正自不解，只见老婆子带了史侯家的两个女人进来，请了贾母的安，又向众人请安毕，便说道：“我们家的老爷、太太、姑娘打发我来说：听见府里的事，原没什么大事，不过一时受惊。恐怕老爷太太烦恼，叫我们过来告诉一声，说这里二老爷是不怕的了。我们姑娘本要自己来的，因不多几日就要出阁，所以不能来了。”贾母听了，不便道谢，说：“你回去给我问好。这是我们的家运合该如此。承你们老爷太太惦记着，改日再去道谢。你们姑娘出阁，想来姑爷是不用说的了，他们的家计如何呢？”两个女人回道：“家计倒不怎么着，只是姑爷长的很好，为人又和平。我们见过好几次，看来和这里的宝二爷差不多儿，还听见说，文才也好。”贾母听了，喜欢道：“这么着才好，这是你们姑娘的造化。只是咱们家的规矩还是南方礼儿，所以新姑爷我们都没见过。我前儿还想起我娘家的人来，最疼的就是你们姑娘，一年三百六十天，在我跟前的日子倒有二百多天。混的这么大了，我原想给他说个好女婿，又为他叔叔不在家，我又不便作主。他既有造化配了个好姑爷，我也放心。月里头出阁，我原想过来吃杯喜酒，不料我们家闹出这样事来，我的心里就象在热锅里熬的似的，那里能够再到你们家去？你回去说我问好，我们这里的人都请安问好。你替另告诉你们姑娘，不用把我放在心上。我是八十多岁的人了，就死也算不得没福了。只愿他过了门，两口儿和和顺顺的百年到老，我就心安了。”说着，不觉掉下泪来。那女人道：“老太太也不必伤心。姑娘过了门，等回了九，少不得同着姑爷过来请老太太的安。那时老太太见了才喜欢呢。”贾母点头。那女人出去。别人都不理论。只有宝玉听着发了一回怔。心里想着：“为什么人家养了女孩儿到大了必要出嫁呢？一出了嫁就改换了一个人似的。史妹妹这么个人，又叫他叔叔硬压着配了人了。他将来见了我，必是也不理我了。我想一个人到了这个没人理的分儿，还活着做什么！”想到这里，又是伤心，见贾母此时才安，又不敢哭，只得闷坐着。\n　　一时贾政不放心，又进来瞧瞧老太太。见是好些，便出来传了赖大，叫他将合府里管事的家人的花名册子拿来，一齐点了一点。除去贾赦入官的人，尚有三十馀家，共男女二百十二名。贾政叫现在府内当差的男人共四十一名进来，问起历年居家用度，共有若干进来，该用若干出去。那管总的家人将近来支用簿子呈上。贾政看时，所入不敷所出，又加连年宫里花用，账上多有在外浮借的。再查东省地租，近年所交不及祖上一半，如今用度比租上加了十倍。贾政不看则已，看了急的跺脚道：“这还了得！我打谅琏儿管事，在家自有把持，岂知好几年头里，已经‘寅年用了卯年’的，还是这样装好看，竟把世职俸禄当作不打紧的事，有什么不败的呢？我如今要省俭起来，已是迟了。”想到这里，背着手踱来踱去，竟无方法。众人知贾政不知理家，也是白操心着急，便说道：“老爷也不用心焦，这是家家这样的。若是统总算起来，连王爷家还不够过的呢，不过是装着门面，过到那里是那里罢咧。如今老爷到底得了主上的恩典，才有这点子家产，若是一并入了官，老爷就不过了不成？”贾政嗔道：“放屁！你们这班奴才最没良心的。仗着主子好的时候儿，任意开销，到弄光了，走的走跑的跑，还顾主子的死活吗？如今你们说是没有查抄，你们知道吗？外头的名声，连大本儿都保不住了，还搁的住你们在外头支架子说大话，诓人骗人？到闹出事来，望主子身上一推就完了！如今大老爷和你珍大爷的事，说是咱们家人鲍二吵嚷的，我看这册子上并没有什么鲍二，这是怎么说？”众人回道：“这鲍二是不在档子上的。先前在宁府册上。为二爷见他老实，把他们两一子叫过来了。后来他女人死了，他又回宁府去。自从老爷衙门里头有事，老太太、太太们和爷们往陵上去了，珍大爷替理家事，带过来的，以后也就去了。老爷几年不管家务事，那里知道这些事呢？老爷只打量着册子上有这个名字就只有这一个人呢，不知道一个人手底下亲戚们也有好几个，奴才还有奴才呢。”贾政道：“这还了得！”想来一时不能清理，只得喝退众人。早打了主意在心里了，且听贾赦等的官事审的怎样再定。\n一日，正在书房筹算，只见一人飞奔进来，说：“请老爷快进内廷问话。”贾政听了，心下着忙，只得进去。\n未知吉凶，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jia Zheng, on hearing that his mother had been taken ill, hurried in to see her. The Lady Dowager had fainted from shock and rage, and Lady Wang and Yuanyang had revived her. She was somewhat better now after taking some sedative pills, but was still weeping in distress. Jia Zheng did his best to comfort her.\n\n“My worthless sons have brought this trouble on us, distressing you, madam,” he said. “If you will take things more calmly, we may still be able to straighten things out outside. If you fall ill, that will make our guilt even heavier.”\n\n“I’m over eighty,” she sobbed. “I’ve enjoyed good fortune all my life, ever since I was a girl and in your father’s time too, thanks to our ancestors. Never have I heard of such shocking goings-on. Now that I’m old, to see you all in trouble is more than I can bear. I’d rather close my eyes and follow your father to the grave!” She broke down again.\n\nJia Zheng was at his wits’ end when a servant announced, “An officer from the inner court wants to see you, sir.” He hurried out and found it was the chief steward of the Prince of Beijing.\n\n“Congratulations!” said the steward, bowing.\n\nJia Zheng thanked him and invited him to be seated.\n\n“What instructions have you from His Highness?” he asked.\n\n“Our prince went with the Prince of Xiping to report to the throne,” the steward told him. “We informed His Majesty of your trepidation and gratitude for the Imperial favour. The Emperor is very compassionate and, in consideration of the fact that the Imperial Consort has not long left the world, is unwilling to punish you further. He has graciously appointed you to your former post of an under-secretary in the Ministry of Works. All your property which was confiscated is to be returned to you, with the exception of Sir She’s share which is to be forfeited to the government. You are ordered to devote yourself to your duties. Only the promissory notes discovered are to be checked by our prince; any which are illegal or carry high interest are to be confiscated according to the law, while those based on the normal interest rates, together with the deeds of your houses and land, are to be returned. Jia Lian is to be deprived of his rank but pardoned and released.”\n\nJia Zheng rose and kowtowed in gratitude for the Imperial clemency, then thanked the prince for his goodness.\n\n“Will you do me the favour of reporting my thanks to His Highness?” he said. “I shall go to the court tomorrow to express my gratitude, and call at His Highness’ residence to kowtow to him.”\n\nWhen the steward had left, the Imperial decree was issued and the officers in charge carried it out. They made a careful check, confiscating what was to be confiscated and returning what was to be returned. Jia Lian was released. And the servants under Jia She had their names registered for government confiscation.\n\nOf the contents of Jia Lian’s rooms, apart from the title-deeds which were returned according to the law, although not all the rest was confiscated the raiding party had made off with most of it, leaving only the heavier furniture. At first he was afraid of punishment, and counted himself lucky to have been let off. But then it distressed him to think that all the savings of the last few years as well as Xifeng’s private hoard — at least fifty or sixty thousand ounces of silver — had vanished overnight. Besides, his father was now in prison and Xifeng was critically ill. He was frantically worried when Jia Zheng called him over.\n\nWith tears in his eyes Jia Zheng asked, “Because of my official duties I’ve had no time to manage the household, so I put you and your wife in charge. Your father’s behaviour was of course hard to curb; but who was it who practised such usury? That’s not the sort of thing our family should do. Now the government has confiscated the money — that doesn’t matter so much. But what a scandal! This is terrible!”\n\nJia Lian fell on his knees.\n\n“In managing the household I never dared to try to profit at the family’s expense,” he said. “All the accounts of income and expenditure were entered by Lai Da, Wu Xindeng and Dai Liang. You can call them to question them, uncle. In the last few years, our expenditure has exceeded our income; and although we haven’t made up the deficit, we’ve had to show a lot of false balances. If you ask my wife, she can tell you. As for those loans, I didn’t even know where the money came from. You’ll have to ask Zhou Rui and Wang’er.”\n\n“So you don’t even know about your own household, to say nothing of the rest!” exclaimed Jia Zheng. “I haven’t time to question you now. As you’re in the clear, you can help to settle your father’s and Cousin Zhen’s business.”\n\n\"Why not send someone to make inquiries at once?\" Chia Lien, smarting from the injustice, assented with tears in his eyes and withdrew.\n\nChia Cheng sighed repeatedly. \"My grandfather worked hard for the court and won two hereditary titles by his exploits,\" he thought. \"Now because of the crimes of both branches of the family, both titles have been revoked. None of my nephews and sons is any good. Oh Heaven, must our house be ruined like this? Although His Majesty has shown exceptional kindness by returning our property, the expenses of both households should be combined and charged to me; but how can I cope with this by myself? What Lien just said is even more fantastic -- not only is our treasury empty, we are in debt; for the last few years we've just had a fine reputation. Why was I such a fool? If my son Chu were still alive he could have helped me; but Pao-yu, for all he's grown up, is completely useless.\" At this point, his clothes were drenched with tears. \"Our Old Ancestress is so advanced in years,\" he went on thinking, \"yet her sons have not waited on her a single day; instead, we made the old lady suffer fear and anguish. To whom can I leave the settlement of all these troubles?\"\n\nHe was giving way to grief when a servant announced that some relatives and friends had called to inquire after them. Chia Cheng thanked them one by one.\n\n\"This is our family disgrace,\" he said. \"I failed to discipline my nephews, and this is the result.\"\n\nOne observed, \"I knew all along that your elder brother the Lord of Sheh was not handling affairs properly, and Master Chen on the other side was even more unbridled. If they'd blundered in their official duties and been reprimanded, their consciences would be clear; but they've brought this on themselves and involved you in it, sir.\"\n\nAnother said, \"There are plenty of other people who carry on too, yet we've never seen censors impeach them. If Lord Chen hadn't offended his friends, this would never have happened.\"\n\nA third put in, \"You can't blame the censors. We heard that it was your servants who stirred up trouble outside, together with some local ruffians. The censors were afraid of making a false report, so they tricked some of your people into talking. We thought you treated your servants very well, sir; how did this come about?\"\n\n\"Generally speaking, servants are a bad lot and not worth keeping,\" remarked another. \"I wouldn't say this to anyone else, but as we're all good friends here I'll speak frankly. When you held a provincial post, sir, I don't suppose you were averse to money -- who is? But your reputation outside was not good, all because of the way your servants carried on. You should have taken precautions. Although your property hasn't been confiscated this time, if the Emperor becomes suspicious again you may find yourself in a very awkward position.\"\n\nIn dismay Chia Cheng asked, \"What have you heard about my reputation?\"\n\n\"Although we've no proof, we heard people outside say that when you were a Grain Intendant the gatemen under you demanded money.\"\n\n\"I can call Heaven to witness that I never had any such intention!\" he exclaimed. \"But if the servants make trouble outside in my name, I can't answer for it.\"\n\n\"It's no use worrying now,\" they said. \"You had better make a strict investigation of all your stewards, and punish severely any of them who have been insubordinate.\"\n\nChia Cheng nodded. Then the gateman came in to report, \"Your son-in-law has sent a messenger to say that he is too busy to come in person, but has come to pay his respects. He says that your elder brother owes him some silver, and he would like you to pay it back, sir.\"\n\nInwardly fuming, Chia Cheng simply said, \"I see.\"\n\nThe others sneered, \"People say your relative Sun Shao-tsu is a scoundrel, and so he is. Instead of coming to see how his father-in-law is and help him out, now that he's been raided, he sends to dun him for payment. That's most unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about him,\" said Chia Cheng. \"That marriage was a mistake on my brother's part. My niece has suffered enough at his hands; and now he comes to pester me.\"\n\nAs they were speaking, Hsueh Ko came in to announce, \"I've found out that Commissioner Chao of the Imperial Guards will act on the censor's\n\nThe only thing to be feared is that the Elder Master and Master Zhen won’t be able to stand up to it.”\n\n“You must go and beg the prince, sir,” they all urged him. “Do try to save the situation. Otherwise, both households are done for.”\n\nJia Zheng expressed his gratitude and agreement, then they dispersed.\n\nBy then lamps had been lit. Jia Zheng went in to pay his respects to the Lady Dowager, and found her slightly better. Upon returning to his own quarters he blamed Jia Lian and his wife for this trouble over the loans which had involved the whole family in such a scandal. He was most upset. However, as Xifeng was seriously ill and naturally felt bad because all her belongings had been confiscated, he could hardly reproach her just then but had to suppress his resentment. Nothing happened that night.\n\nThe next day Jia Zheng went to court to express his thanks for the Emperor’s clemency, then called to kowtow his gratitude to the princes of Beijing and Xiping, begging them to intercede for his brother and nephew. Both princes promised to do this. Jia Zheng also asked other colleagues and friends to put in a good word for them.\n\nJia Lian, having found out that his father and cousin were in serious trouble and there was no way to save them, had to go home. Pinger was there in tears keeping watch over Xifeng, while Qiutong in the side-room was complaining about her. Jia Lian went over to the couch and saw that Xifeng was at her last gasp. Though he had plenty of grievances, at this juncture he could not voice them.\n\nPinger sobbed, “Things have come to such a pass, what’s gone can’t come back. But the mistress is so ill, we must get another doctor to see her.”\n\n“Pooh!” he spat. “How can I care about her when my own life may be in danger?”\n\nXifeng heard this and opened her eyes. She said nothing but tears streamded down her cheeks. When Jia Lian had left she told Pinger, “Don’t be so foolish. At a time like this, why care about me? I’d rather die today. If you have any love for me, if after my death you’ll bring up Qiaojie properly, I’ll be grateful to you even in the Nether World.”\n\nThis made Pinger cry even more bitterly.\n\n“You’re not stupid,” continued Xifeng. “Though they haven’t come to say so, they must be blaming me. Of course the trouble started outside, but if I hadn’t made those loans this wouldn’t have involved me. All my calculations and struggles to be the winner have ended with my being the loser! I seem to have heard too that Master Zhen is charged with taking by force some decent citizen’s wife as his concubine, and when she refused he drove her to suicide; and that a certain Zhang is involved. Can you think who that is? If this case comes up, our Second Master is bound to be implicated too. How can I face people then? I’d like to kill myself at once, but I haven’t the courage to swallow gold or poison. And you want to fetch a doctor — isn’t that the way to kill me, not to save me?”\n\nPinger, more appalled by this, could see how desperate Xifeng was. Afraid she might commit suicide, she kept close watch over her.\n\nFortunately the Lady Dowager knew nothing of all this. Because she was slightly better and Jia Zheng had been let off, with Baoyu and Baochai in constant attendance she felt rather reassured. Having always had a soft spot for Xifeng, she told Yuanyang, “Take some of my things over to Xifeng, and give Pinger some money to look after her well. I’ll make other arrangements by and by.” She also ordered Lady Wang to take good care of Lady Xing.\n\nBy now the Ning Mansion had been taken over by the government and all its property, deeds and slaves had been registered and confiscated. The old lady sent carriages to fetch Madam You and her daughter-in-law over. Alas for the illustrious Ning Mansion! Of its masters only these two ladies were left, together with Peifeng and Xieluan, without a single maid. The Lady Dowager assigned them a house next to Xichun’s quarters, and gave them four old serving-women and two maids. Their meals were sent from the big kitchen, their clothes and other effects were provided by the old lady, and their petty cash was drawn from the accounts office — the same allowance as that of the ladies in the Rong Mansion.\n\nThe Jia family’s hereditary rank had been taken from them and the two Dukes’ portraits removed from the Ancestral Temple. Though the Emperor in his mercy had allowed them to keep their mansion, both Jia She and Jia Zhen had been sentenced to banishment for frontier service. Jia Rong, being young and considered to have acted under pressure from his elders, was exempted from punishment but forbidden to take the examinations. The authorities were ordered to confiscate only those parts of the Jia property which had been improperly acquired. The Emperor’s instructions were that the family was to be allowed to keep enough to live on.\n\nJia Lian and Xifeng’s cases were to be dealt with separately. Jia She and Jia Zhen had been using the Brocade Guard, and there was nothing left in the accounts to cover these expenses. Xifeng had nothing left of her own, and Jia Lian was up to his ears in debt. Jia Zheng was completely ignorant of household matters.\n\n‘I’ve already asked a friend to help,’ was all he could say. ‘He’ll see to it.’\n\nJia Lian was at his wits’ end. He thought of appealing to their relatives, but Aunt Xue’s family was ruined, Wang Zi-teng was dead, and the rest were either unable or unwilling to help. He was finally reduced to sending someone secretly to sell some of their land for a few thousand taels, to meet their immediate expenses in prison. This step of his gave the family servants their opportunity. Seeing their masters in such desperate straits, they too began helping themselves to whatever they could lay their hands on, and even ‘borrowed’ some of the rent from the Eastern Estate, in their masters’ name. But more of this later.\n\nLet us return to Grandmother Jia. She had seen the family’s hereditary rank taken from them, and their two young masters held in prison for questioning. Lady Xing and You-shi wept day and night, and Xifeng was critically ill. Although Bao-yu and Bao-chai were at her side and did their best to comfort her, they could not share her burden, and she passed her days and nights in a state of constant agitation, her thoughts wandering from past to present, her eyes never free from tears. One evening she told Bao-yu to go back to his room, struggled into a sitting position and supported herself on a staff. She told Faithful to go to all the different shrines and burn incense, and had a great spiral of ‘Glorious’ incense lit in the courtyard. Then, leaning on her staff, she made her way out into the courtyard. Amber knew that she intended to pray, and laid a crimson camel-hair cushion for her to kneel on. Lady Jia planted her stick in the ground, and was about to kneel, when Faithful came up to her:\n\n‘Your vase is too heavy, ma’am. Let me help you.’\n\nShe supported her as she knelt, and Lady Jia bowed down to the ground several times, and began to recite a Buddhist prayer. Then, with tears in her eyes, she raised her head and prayed to Heaven:\n\n‘Almighty Buddha in Heaven above! I, née Shi, of the Jia family, pray with a humble and contrite heart. In your infinite mercy, hear my prayer! For generations the Jias have acted in good faith and never resorted to violence or intimidation. I have helped my husband and nurtured my sons; I have tried to do no evil, and have done what little good I can. But our younger generations have grown up so spoiled and wanton and have so abused your precious gifts, that they have now brought upon us the calamity of confiscation. My sons and grandsons are in prison, and I fear the worst for them. The fault is mine, for failing to guide them and teach them as a mother should. I beg you in your mercy to watch over them in prison and protect them from harm, and to grant the sick a speedy recovery. If there must be retribution for our family’s sins, I beg that I alone be punished. Spare my sons and grandsons, I pray you! If you will only hear my prayer and take my life, that they may be pardoned and escape further suffering, I shall die content.’\n\nShe came to the end of her prayer and could contain herself no longer. She broke down and sobbed bitterly. Faithful and Pearl did their best to comfort her, and helped her back into the house.\n\nThey found Lady Wang there with Bao-yu and Bao-chai, who had come to say goodnight. When they saw how upset Lady Jia was, the three of them also began to weep. Bao-chai had her own special reasons for grief. She was thinking of her brother Pan in prison, and of his impending sentence. Would it be possible to obtain a reduction? Her parents-in-law might be safe for the time being, but she could see for herself how the family’s fortunes had declined. And Bao-yu was still as deranged and listless as ever. When she thought of the future, her own prospects, she wept even more bitterly than Lady Jia or Lady Wang. Bao-yu, seeing her weep, was also greatly affected.\n\n‘Grandmother is old,’ he thought, ‘and has never known a moment’s peace. Mother and Father must be distressed by the present state of affairs. And all my cousins have scattered, some have died; our numbers grow daily fewer. When I think of the poetry club, and the fun we used to have in the garden! And now Cousin Lin is dead, and I have been depressed ever since. I can’t even cry when I want to, with Bao-chai around. And she has her own troubles, worrying about her mother and her brother. I never see her smile anymore. Now she is utterly miserable, and it distresses me more than I can say.’\n\nHe burst into tears and cried at the top of his voice. The maids, Faithful, Sunset, Oriole and Aroma, were all present, and each had her own reasons for being sad. They now began weeping in a most heart-rending fashion. Soon the whole room was sobbing and wailing, and there was no one left to comfort anyone else. The sound of their grief reached the night-watchwomen outside, who thought at first that Lady Jia must have died, and rushed in a panic to report to Jia Zheng. He was sitting in his study, brooding over his family’s misfortunes, when one of Lady Jia’s servants came running in with this alarming news. Greatly alarmed, he hurried indoors. From a distance he could hear the sound of many voices crying, and thinking the worst he sped on his way, his soul almost flying from his body in terror. When he entered Lady Jia’s apartment and saw that she was only sitting there crying, and that there was no immediate cause for alarm, he pulled himself together and protested:\n\n‘You should be trying to comfort Mother, not joining in and upsetting her like this!’\n\n\"Why, are you all trying to outdo each other in weeping?\" At that they hastily dried their tears and stared at each other in consternation.\n\nJia Zheng stepped forward to comfort the Lady Dowager and reproved the others, thinking, \"We came to comfort the old lady for fear she might grieve; but carried away by emotion we've all burst out weeping. How very odd!\"\n\nAs they were puzzling over this, an old nurse came in with two maids sent by the Marquis of Zhongjing. They paid their respects to the Lady Dowager and the rest.\n\n\"Our master, madam and young lady sent us,\" they announced, \"to say that they've heard what happened in your mansion and it's nothing serious -- just a fright. They were afraid you might be worried, madam, and told us to come and report that the Second Master here is out of danger. Our young lady would have come herself, but she's getting married in a few days' time so she can't.\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager, not venturing to thank them for their concern, replied, \"Give them my best regards when you go back. This is our family's fate, there's no help for it. Please thank your master and mistress for their concern; we'll express our gratitude another day. Your young lady's marriage must mean that her fiance is an exceptional young man. What is his family's situation?\"\n\n\"The family's nothing much, but the young gentleman's very handsome and good-tempered. We've seen him several times and he seems the image of your Master Bao. They say he's a good scholar too.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" said the Lady Dowager cheerfully. \"Your young lady is lucky. But according to our southern custom we don't see the bridegroom, so none of us has set eyes on him. The other day I was thinking of my family: of all my nieces I'm fondest of your young lady, who used to spend more than two hundred days of the year with me. Now she's grown up. I'd have liked to find her a good husband, but as her uncle wasn't here I couldn't decide for her. Since she's lucky enough to have a fine fiance, that sets my mind at rest. I'd meant to go to her wedding this month, but now this trouble in our house has made me as frantic as if I were boiling in a cauldron -- how can I go to your place? Give them all my best regards. Tell your young lady not to worry about me. I'm over eighty, so even if I died now I'd have lived to a good old age. As long as she and her husband live happily together to a ripe old age, that will set my mind at rest.\" Her voice faltered and she shed tears.\n\n\"Don't distress yourself, madam,\" said the maids. \"After the wedding, once your grandniece has paid the nine-day visit to her parents, she's bound to come with her husband to pay her respects; and then you'll be able to see how happy she is.\"\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded and the two maids withdrew. The others paid little attention to this, but Baoyu listened in a daze.\n\n\"Why must girls be married off when they grow up?\" he wondered. \"Once married they change. A girl like Cousin Shi has been forced by her uncle to marry someone. In future, when she sees me she's bound to ignore me. What's the point of living when you're ignored by everyone?\" This reflection reduced him to despair, but as his grandmother had just been comforted he dared not cry, and had to sit there gloomily by himself.\n\nPresently Jia Zheng, still worried, came in to see how the old lady was. Finding her calmer he went out and summoned Lai Da to bring the register of all the servants in the different households. The total number of men and women, excluding those taken away when Jia She was arrested, was over two hundred and twelve in more than thirty households. Jia Zheng ordered the forty-one men now working in the mansion to come in, and asked them about the household's annual income and expenditure in previous years.\n\nHe decided to make some cuts. The steward in charge brought him the recent account books, and when Jia Zheng looked at them he found that expenditure exceeded income. Moreover, because of the heavy expenses incurred in the last few years in the Palace, many items in the accounts were covered by outside loans. Then when he checked the land rents from the Eastern Mansion, these in the last few years had come to less than half of what they were in his grandfather’s time, whereas current expenses were ten times higher. This discovery made him stamp his feet in despair.\n\n“This is terrible!” he exclaimed. “I thought that since Lian took charge he must have run things better. Who could have guessed that we’ve been overspending for years and just keeping up appearances? If we look on our hereditary stipend as unimportant, how can we avoid bankruptcy? But it’s too late now to start retrenching.”\n\nHands clasped behind his back he paced the floor, at his wits’ end. Knowing that he was no manager and that this anxiety was pointless, his servants said, “Don’t distress yourself, sir. All families are in the same fix. Why, even the households of princes are hard up, but they just keep up appearances and live from hand to mouth. Now that you’ve been favoured by the Emperor, sir, and have this property, even if it were all confiscated you’d still manage somehow.”\n\n“Nonsense!” he fumed. “You slaves are all heartless. When your masters are doing well you spend freely; when the money’s gone you run away, leaving your masters to shift for themselves. You say we haven’t been confiscated, but do you know that outside our reputation is so bad we can’t hold on to our capital? How can you put on a show outside and boast and swindle people? If you land in trouble, you’ll push the blame on your masters. In the case of the Elder Master and Master Zhen, the charge was brought by that fellow Bao Er of our house. But I don’t see his name in this book. How do you explain that?”\n\n“Bao Er isn’t on our register,” they told him. “He used to be on the register of the Ning Mansion. Because Master Lian thought him honest, he and his son were transferred here. Then after his wife died he went back to the Ning Mansion. After you had that trouble in the yamen, sir, and the old lady, the mistresses and young masters went to the mausoleum, Master Zhen took charge here and brought him back; but later he left again. You’ve had no hand in running the household for years, sir, so how could you know all this? You think each name in the book stands for just one person, not realizing that each has several dependants, and we slaves have slaves of our own too.”\n\n“This is monstrous!” he cried.\n\nReflecting that it was impossible to straighten this out at once, he had to dismiss them. He had already made up his mind what to do, but would wait to see the outcome of the court case of Jia She and the others before taking action.\n\nOne day, as he was making calculations in his study, in ran one of his men to announce, “His Majesty wants you to go to the Inner Court at once for an audience, sir.”\n\nJia Zheng, much taken aback, had to go.\n\nTo know whether this boded well or ill, read the next chapter."
