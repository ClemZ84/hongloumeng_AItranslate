  "original": "话说那柳家的，听了这小么儿一席话，笑道：“好猴儿崽子！你亲婶子找野老儿去了，你不多得一个叔叔吗，有什么疑的？别叫我把你头上的杩子盖揪下来，还不开门让我进去呢。”那小厮且不推门，又拉着笑道：“好婶子，你这一进去，好歹偷几个杏儿出来赏我吃。我这里老等。你要忘了，日后半夜三更打酒买油的，我不给你老人家开门，也不答应你，随你干叫去。”柳氏啐道：“发了昏的！今年还比往年？把这些东西部分给了众妈妈了。一个个的不象抓破了脸的，人打树底下一过，两眼就象那黧鸡似的，还动他的果子！可是你舅母、姨娘两三个亲戚都管着，怎么不和他们要，倒和我来要？这可是‘仓老鼠问老鸹去借粮，守着的没有，飞着的倒有’。”小厮笑道：“嗳哟，没有罢了，说上这些闲话。我看你老人家从今以后就用不着我了？就是姐姐有了好地方儿，将来呼唤我们的日子多着呢，只要我们多答应他些就有了。”柳氏听了笑道：“你这个小猴儿精又捣鬼了，你姐姐有什么好地方儿？”那小厮笑道：“不用哄我了，早已知道了。单是你们有内纤，难道我们就没有内纤不成？我虽在这里听差，里头却也有两个姐姐成个体统的，什么事瞒的过我！”正说着，只听门内又有老婆子向外叫：“小猴儿，快传你柳婶子去罢，再不来可就误了。”柳家的听了，不顾和那小厮说话，忙推门进去，笑说：“不必忙，我来了。”一面来至厨房，虽有几个同伴的人，他们都不敢自专，单等他来调停分派。一面问众人：“五丫头那里去了？”众人都说：“才往茶房里找我们姐妹去了。”柳家的听了，便将茯苓霜搁起，且按着房头分派菜馔。忽见迎春房里小丫头莲花儿走来说：“司棋姐姐说，要碗鸡蛋，顿的嫩嫩的。”柳家的道：“就是这一样儿尊贵。不知怎么，今年鸡蛋短的很，十个钱一个还找不出来。昨日上头给亲戚家送粥米去，四五个买办出去，好容易才凑了二千个来，我那里找去？你说给他，改日吃罢。”莲花儿道：“前日要吃豆腐，你弄了些馊的，叫他说了我一顿，今儿要鸡蛋又没有了。什么好东西，我就不信连鸡蛋都没有了，别叫我翻出来。”一面说，一面真个走来揭起菜箱一看，只见里面果有十来个鸡蛋，说道：“这不是？你就这么利害，吃的是主子分给我们的分例，你为什么心疼？又不是你下的蛋，怕人吃了。”柳家的忙丢了手里的活计，便上来说道：“你少满嘴里混，你妈才下蛋呢！通共留下这几个，预备菜上的飘马儿，姑娘们不要，还不肯做上去呢。预备遇急儿的，你们吃了，倘或一声要起来，没有好的，连鸡蛋都没了！你们深宅大院，‘水来伸手，饭来张口’，只知鸡蛋是平常东西，那里知道外头买卖的行市呢。别说这个，有一年连草棍子还没了的日子还有呢！我劝他们，细米白饭，每日肥鸡大鸭子，将就些儿也罢了。吃腻了肠子，天天又闹起故事来了。鸡蛋、豆腐，又是什么面筋、酱萝卜炸儿，敢自倒换口味。只是我又不是答应你们的。一处要一样，就是十来样，我倒不用伺候头层主子，只预备你们二层主子了。”\n    莲花儿听了便红了脸，喊道：“谁天天要你什么来，你说这么两车子话！叫你来不是为便宜是为什么？前日春燕来，说晴雯姐姐要吃蒿子杆儿，你怎么忙着还问肉炒鸡炒？春燕说荤的不好，另叫你炒个面筋儿，少搁油才好，你忙着就说自己‘发昏’，赶着洗手炒了，狗颠屁股儿似的亲自捧了去。今儿反倒拿我作筏子，说我给众人听！”柳家的忙道：“阿弥陀佛，这些人眼见的。别说前日一次，就从旧年以来，那屋里偶然间不论姑娘姐儿们要添一样半样，谁不是先拿了钱来另买另添？有的没的，名声好听。算着连姑娘带姐儿们四五十人，一日也只管要两只鸡、两只鸭子、一二十斤肉、一吊钱的菜蔬，你们算算，够做什么的？连本项两顿饭还撑持不住，还搁得住这个点这样、那个点那样？买来的又不吃，又要别的去！既这样，不如回了大太，多添些分例，也象大厨房里预备老太太的饭，把天下所有的菜蔬用水牌写了，天天转着吃，到一个月现算倒好。连前日三姑娘和宝姑娘偶然商量了要吃个油盐炒豆芽儿来，现打发个姐儿拿着五百钱给我。我倒笑起来了，说：‘二位姑娘就是大肚子弥勒佛，也吃不了五百钱的。这二三十个钱的事，还备得起。’赶着我送回钱去，到底不收，说赏我打酒吃，又说：‘如今厨房在里头，保不住屋里的人不去叨登。一盐一酱那不是钱买的？你不给又不好，给了你又没的赔，你拿着这个钱，权当还了他们素日叨登的东西窝儿。’这就是明白体下的姑娘，我们心里只替他念佛。没的赵姨奶奶听了又气不忿，反说太便宜了我，隔不了十天也打发个小丫头子来，寻这样寻那样，我倒好笑起来。你们竟成了例，不是这个就是那个，我那里有这些赔的？”\n　　正乱时，只见司棋又打发人来催莲花儿，说他：“死在这里？怎么就不回去？”莲花儿赌气回来，便添了一篇话，告诉了司棋。司棋听了，不免心头起火。此刻伺候迎春饭罢，带了小丫头们走来，见了许多人正吃饭，见他来得势头不好，都忙起身陪笑让坐。司棋便喝命小丫头子动手：“凡箱柜所有的菜蔬，只管扔出去喂狗，大家赚不成！”小丫头子们巴不得一声，七手八脚抢上去，一顿乱翻乱掷。慌的众人一面拉劝，一面央告司棋说：“姑娘别误听了小孩子的话，柳嫂子有八个脑袋，也不敢得罪姑娘。说鸡蛋难买是真。我们才也说他不知好歹，凭是什么东西，也少不得变法儿去。他已经悟过来了，连忙蒸上了。姑娘不信，瞧那火上。”司棋被众人一顿好言语，方将气劝得渐平了，小丫头子们也没得摔完东西，便拉开了。司棋连说带骂闹了一回，方被众人劝去。柳家的只好摔碗丢盘，自己咕唧了一回，蒸了一碗鸡蛋令人送去。司棋全泼了地下。那人回来也不敢说，恐又生事。\n　　柳家的打发他女儿喝了一回汤，吃了半碗粥，又将茯苓霜一节说了。五儿听罢，便心下要分些赠芳官，遂用纸另包了一半，趁黄昏人稀之时，自己花遮柳隐的来找芳官，且喜无人盘问。一径到了怡红院门首，不好进去，只在一簇玫瑰花前站立，远远的望着。有一盏茶时候，可巧春燕出来，忙上前叫住。春燕不知是那一个，到跟前方看真切，因问：“做什么？”五儿笑道：“你叫出芳官来，我和他说话。”春燕悄笑道：“姐姐太性急了。横竖等十来日就来了，只管找他做什么？方才使了他往前头去了，你且等他一等。不然，有什么话告诉我，等我告诉他，恐怕你等不得，只怕关了园门。”五儿便将获茯苓霜递给春燕，又说这是茯苓霜，如何吃，如何补益，“我得了些送他的，转烦你递给他就是了。”说毕，便走回来。正走蓼溆一带，忽迎见林之孝家的带着几个婆子走来。五儿藏躲不及，只得上来问好。林家的问道：“我听见你病了，怎么跑到这里来？”五儿陪笑说道：“因这两日好些，跟我妈进来散散闷。才因我妈使我，到怡红院送家伙去。”林之孝家的说道：“这话岔了。方才我见你妈出去，我才关门。既是你妈使了你去，他如何不告诉我说你在这里呢？竟出去让我关门，什么意思？可是你撒谎。”五儿听了，没话回答，只说：“原是我妈一早教我去取的，我忘了，挨到这时我才想起来。只怕我妈错认我先去了，所以没和大娘说。”\n　　林之孝家的听他词钝意虚，又因近日玉钏儿说那边正房内失落了东西，几个丫头对赖，没主儿，心下便起了疑。可巧小蝉、莲花儿和几个媳妇子走来见了这事，便说道：“林奶奶倒要审审他。这两日他往这里头跑的不象，鬼鬼祟祟的，不知干些什么事。”小蝉又道：“正是。昨日玉钏儿姐姐说：‘太太耳房里的柜子开了，少了好些零碎东西。’琏二奶奶打发平姑娘和玉钏儿姐姐要些玫瑰露，谁知也少了一罐子，不是找还不知道呢！”莲花儿笑道：“这我没听见。今日我倒看见一个露瓶子。”林之孝家的正因这事没主儿，每日凤姐儿使平儿催逼他，一听此言，忙问在那里。莲花儿便说：“在他们厨房里呢。”林之孝家的听了，忙命打了灯笼，带着众人来寻。五儿急的便说：“那原是宝二爷屋里的芳官给我的。”林之孝家的便说：“不管你‘方官’‘圆官’！现有赃证，我只呈报了，凭你主子前辩去。”一面说，一面进入厨房。莲花儿带着，取出露瓶。恐还偷有别物，又细细搜了一遍，又得了一包茯苓霜。一并拿了，带了五儿来回李纨与探春。\n　　那时李纨正因兰儿病了，不理事务，只命去见探春。探春已归房。人回进去，丫鬟们都在院内纳凉，探春在内盥沐，只有侍书回进去，半日出来说：“姑娘知道了，叫你们找平儿回二奶奶去。”林之孝家的只得领出来，到凤姐那边，先找着平儿进去回了凤姐。凤姐方才睡下，听见此事，便吩咐：“将他娘打四十板子，撵出去，永不许进二门。把五儿打四十板子，立刻交给庄子上，或卖或配人。”平儿听了出来，依言吩咐了林之孝家的。五儿吓得哭哭啼啼，给平儿跪着，细诉芳官之事。平儿道：“这也不难，等明日问了芳官便知真假。但这茯苓霜前日人送了来，还等老太太、太太回来看了才敢打动，这不该偷了去。”五儿见问，忙又将他舅舅送的一节说出来。平儿听了，笑道：“这样说，你竟是个平白无辜的人了，拿你来顶缸的。此时天晚，奶奶才进了药歇下，不便为这点子小事去絮叨。如今且将他交给上夜的人看守一夜，等明日我回了奶奶，再作道理。”林之孝家的不敢违拗，只得带出来，交给上夜的媳妇们看守着，自己便去了。\n　　这里五儿被人软禁起来，一步不敢多走。又兼众媳妇也有劝他说：“不该做这没行止的事。”也有抱怨说：“正经更还坐不上来，又弄个贼来给我们看守。倘或眼不见，寻了死，或逃走了，都是我们的不是。”又有素日一于与柳家不睦的人，见了这般十分趁愿，都来奚落嘲戏他。这五儿心内又气又委屈，竟无处可诉！且本来怯弱有病，这一夜思茶无茶，思水无水，思睡无衾枕，呜呜咽咽直哭了一夜。谁知和他母女不和的那些人，巴不得一时就撵他出门去。生恐次日有变，大家先起个清早，都悄悄的来买转平儿，送了些东西，一面又奉承他办事简断，一面又讲述他母亲素日许多不好处。平儿一一的都应着。打发他们去了，却悄悄的来访袭人，问他可果真芳官给他玫瑰露了。袭人便说：“露却是给了芳官，芳官转给何人，我却不知。”袭人于是又问芳官，芳官听了，唬了一跳，忙应是自己送他的。芳官便又告诉了宝玉，宝玉也慌了，说：“露虽有了，若勾起茯苓霜来，他自然也实供。若听见了是他舅舅门上得的，他舅舅又有了不是，岂不是人家的好意，反被咱们陷害了？”因忙和平儿计议：“露的事虽完了，然这霜也是有不是的。好姐姐，你只叫他也说是芳官给的就完了。”平儿笑道：“虽如此，只是他昨晚已经同人说是他舅舅给的了，如何又说你给的？况且那边所丢的霜正没主儿，如今有赃证的白放了，又去找谁？谁还肯认？众人也未必心服。”晴雯走来，笑道：“太太那边的露，再无别人，分明是彩云偷了给环哥儿去了，你们可瞎乱说。”平儿笑道：“谁不知这个原故？这会子玉钏儿急的哭，悄悄问他，他要应了，玉钏儿也罢了，大家也就混着不问了，谁好意揽这事呢？可恨彩云不但不应，他还挤玉钏儿，说他偷了去了。两个人‘窝里炮’，先吵的合府都知道了，我们怎么装没事人呢？少不得要查的。殊不知告失盗的就是贼，又没赃证，怎么说他？”宝玉道：“也罢。这件事，我也应起来，就说原是我要吓他们玩，悄悄的偷了太太的来了：两件事就都完了。”袭人道：“也倒是一件阴骘事，保全人的贼名儿。只是太太听见了，又说你小孩子气，不知好歹了。”平儿笑道：“也倒是小事。如今就打赵姨娘屋里起了赃来也容易，我只怕又伤着一个好人的体面。别人都不必管，只这一个人岂不又生气？我可怜的是他，不肯为‘打老鼠伤了玉瓶儿’。”说着，把三个指头一伸。袭人等听说，便知他说的是探春，大家都忙说：“可是这话，竟是我们这里应起来的为是。”平儿又笑道：“也须得把彩云和玉钏儿两个孽障叫了来，问准了他方好。不然，他们得了意，不说为这个，倒象我没有本事问不出来。就是这里完事，他们以后越发偷的偷、不管的不管了。”袭人等笑道：“正是，也要你留个地步。”\n　　平儿便命一个人叫了他两个来，说道：“不用慌，贼已有了。”玉钏儿先问：“贼在那里？”平儿道：“现在二奶奶屋里呢，问他什么应什么。我心里明白，知道不是他偷的，可怜他害怕，都承认了。这里宝二爷不过意，要替他认一半。我要说出来呢，但只是这做贼的，素日又是和我好的一个姐妹；窝主却是平常，里面又伤了一个好人的体面，因此为难。少不得央求宝二爷应了，大家无事。如今反要问你们两个还是怎么样。要从此以后，大家小心存体面呢，就求宝二爷应了，要不然，我就回了二奶奶，别冤屈了人。”彩云听了，不觉红了脸，一时羞恶之心感发，便说道：“姐姐放心，也不用冤屈好人，我说了罢。伤体面，偷东西，原是赵姨奶奶央及我再三，我拿了些给环哥儿是情真。连太太在家我们还拿过，各人去送人，也是常有的。我原说说过两天就完了，如今既冤屈了人，我心里也不忍。姐姐竟带了我回奶奶去，一概应了完事。”众人听了这话，一个个都诧异，他竟这样有肝胆。宝玉忙笑道：“彩云姐姐果然是个正经人。如今也不用你应，我只说我悄悄的偷的吓你们玩，如今闹出事来，我原该承认。我只求姐姐们以后省些事，大家就好了。”彩云道：“我干的事为什么叫你应？死活我该去受。”平儿袭人忙道：“不是这么说。你一应了，未免又叨登出赵姨奶奶来，那时三姑娘听见，岂不又生气？竟不如宝二爷应了，大家没事。且除了这几个人，都不知道，这么何等的干净。但只以后千万大家小心些就是了。要拿什么，好歹等太太到家；那怕连房子给了人，我们就没干系了。”彩云听了，低头想了想，只得依允。\n　　于是大家商议妥贴，平儿带了他两个并芳官来至上夜房中，叫了五儿，将茯苓霜一节也悄悄的教他说系芳官给的，五儿感激不尽。平儿带他们来至自己这边，已见林之孝家的带领了几个媳妇，押解着柳家的等够多时了。林之孝家的又向平儿说：“今日一早押了他来，怕园里没有人伺候早饭，我暂且将秦显的女人派了去伺候姑娘们的饭呢。”平儿道：“秦显的女人是谁？我不大相熟啊。”林之孝家的道：“他是园里南角子上夜的，白日里没什么事，所以姑娘不认识。高高儿的孤拐，大大的眼睛，最干净爽利的。”玉钏儿道：“是了，姐姐你怎么忘了？他是跟二姑娘的司棋的婶子。司棋的父亲虽是大老爷那边的人，他这叔叔却是咱们这边的。”平儿听了，方想起来，笑道：“哦，你早说是他，我就明白了。”又笑道：“也太派急了些。如今这事，八下里水落石出了，连前日太太屋里丢的也有了主儿。是宝玉那日过来，和这两个孽障不知道要什么来着，偏这两个孽障怄他玩，说太太不在家，不敢拿。宝玉便瞅着他们不提防，自己进去拿了些个什么出来。这两个孽障不知道，就吓慌了。如今宝玉听见带累了别人，方细细的告诉了我，拿出东西来我瞧，一件不差。那茯苓霜也是宝玉外头得了的，也曾赏过许多人，不独园内人有，连妈妈子们讨了出去给亲戚们吃，又转送人。袭人也曾给过芳官一流的人。他们私情各自来往，也是常事。前日那两篓还摆在议事厅上，好好的原封没动，怎么就混赖起人来？等我回了奶奶再说。”说毕，抽身进了卧房，将此事照前言回了凤姐儿一遍。凤姐儿道：“虽如此说，但宝玉为人，不管青红皂白，爱兜揽事情。别人再求求他去，他又搁不往人两句好话，给他个炭篓子带上，什么事他不应承？咱们若信了，将来若大事也如此，如何治人？还要细细的追求才是。依我的主意，把太太屋里的丫头都拿来，虽不便擅加拷打，只叫他们垫着磁瓦子跪在太阳地下，茶饭也不用给他们吃。一日不说跪一日，就是铁打的，一日也管招了。”又道：“‘苍蝇不抱没缝儿的鸡蛋’，虽然这柳家的没偷，到底有些影儿人才说他。虽不加贼刑，也革出不用。朝廷原有挂误的，到底不算委屈了他。“平儿道：“何苦来操这心？‘得放手时须放手’，什么大不了的事，乐得施恩呢。依我说，纵在这屋里操上一百分心，终久是回那边屋里去的，没的结些小人的仇恨，使人含恨抱怨。况且自己又三灾八难的，好容易怀了一个哥儿，到了六七个月还掉了，焉知不是素日操劳太过，气恼伤着的？如今趁早儿见一半不见一半的，也倒罢了。”一席话说的凤姐儿倒笑了，道：“随你们罢！没的怄气。”平儿笑道：“这不是正经话？”说毕，转身出来，一一发放。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After listening to the page’s speech, Liu’s wife chuckled.\n\n“You young rascal! If your auntie goes off to find herself a fancy man, won’t that give you another uncle? What are you afraid of? If you don’t open up and let me in, I’ll pull that tuft of hair off your head.”\n\nInstead of opening the gate, the page tugged at her and said with a grin, “Do, auntie, and when you’re in, pinch a few apricots for me to taste. I’ll be waiting for you here. If you forget, next time you want to buy oil or wine in the middle of the night, don’t expect me to open the gate or answer when you call. You can stand there calling as long as you like.”\n\n“You crazy thing!” She spat in disgust. “This year’s not like other years. These fruit trees have been allocated to different nurses, and they’re not like shameless hussies who’d let people pick the fruit. The moment anyone goes under the trees they stare with eyes like coaltits. How dare you touch their fruit? Your aunts and the other women are in charge here. Why not ask them for some instead of asking me? This is like the rat in the barn asking a crow for corn — the one who has it can’t get at it, while the one who can get at it hasn’t any.”\n\n“All right, if you haven’t, that’s that. Why spin such a yarn?” retorted the page. “Are you going to have no further use for me from now on? When your daughter’s promoted to a fine new place, she’ll be needing our help even more often. We’ll have to do her plenty of favours then.”\n\n“What nonsense, you young monkey. What fine new place for my daughter?”\n\n“Don’t try to fool me. I’ve known for some time. You think you’re the only ones with friends tipping you off? Though I work outside, I’ve two sisters inside who know the ropes. How can you keep anything from me?”\n\nAs he was speaking an old woman inside called, “Little monkey, hurry up and fetch Mrs. Liu. If she doesn’t come soon, it’ll be too late.”\n\nAt that Mrs. Liu, not stopping to bandy more words with the page, hastily pushed open the gate and went in.\n\n“Don’t worry, I’m here,” she cried.\n\nShe went straight to the kitchen where, although some of the others had already assembled, not liking to take the initiative they were waiting for her to come and allocate the tasks.\n\n“Where’s Number Five?” she asked.\n\n“She’s just gone to the tea-house to look for her sister,” the others told her.\n\nSo Mrs. Liu put the poria away and started assigning the dishes to different servants. Just then Lotus, a young maid from Yingchun’s apartments, came in.\n\n“Siqi wants a bowl of eggs steamed nice and tender,” she announced.\n\n“That’s asking for the moon!” exclaimed Mrs. Liu. “I don’t know why, but there’s a fearful shortage of eggs this year. You can’t buy one for love or money. Yesterday, when the mistresses sent presents of congee and rice to some relatives, four or five purchasers had the greatest difficulty in getting two thousand eggs. Where do you expect me to find any? Tell her she’ll have to wait a few days.”\n\n“The other day she fancied beancurd, but what you sent was sour and she gave me a talking-to,” said Lotus. “Now there are no eggs. What’s so wonderful about eggs anyway? I don’t believe it. Let me have a look.”\n\nShe went over to raise the lid of the food hamper and discovered a dozen or so eggs inside.\n\n“What are these?” she cried. “Why are you so stingy? It’s our mistresses’ allowance we’re eating, not yours. Are you afraid we’ll eat you out of house and home? It’s not as if you’d laid these eggs yourself.”\n\nDropping her work, Mrs. Liu hurried over.\n\n“Don’t talk so silly,” she scolded. “It’s your mother who lays eggs. We’ve only these few left to dress dishes with or to use as garnishing. If the young ladies don’t want them, we don’t like to use them. We’re keeping them for emergencies. If you eat them now and they suddenly call for some, we’ll have none to give them, not so much as an egg-shell.”\n\n\"You live in grand mansions, with 'water brought when you hold out your hands and food when you open your mouths,'\" she retorted. \"All you know is that eggs are common fare, you've no idea how prices have shot up outside. Let me tell you, there was a year when we didn't even have any kindling! I advise you to make do with your fine rice and the fat hens and ducks you get every day. You've cloyed your stomachs with rich food and are forever starting something new. Now you want eggs and beancurd, now gluten and pickled turnip — just for a change of diet. But I'm not here to wait on you. If each place asks for one dish, that means a dozen or more. I needn't serve the real masters, just you second-class mistresses!\"\n\nLotus flushed with anger. \"Who asks you for things every day?\" she cried. \"What a way to talk! If not to get things cheap, what did they put you here for? The other day when Swallow came and said Miss Qingwen fancied some artemisia, why were you so eager to ask whether she wanted it fried with meat or chicken? When Swallow said she didn't want it with meat, but would like some fried gluten with very little oil, you lost no time saying you'd 'take leave of your senses' to please her. You washed your hands then and there to fry it, and wagging your tail like a dog you took it to her yourself. How can you hold me up today as an example to everyone?\"\n\n\"Gracious Buddha!\" exclaimed Liu's wife. \"These young ladies can see what's what. Not to speak of the other day, but ever since last year whenever any of the young ladies or maids has asked for an extra dish or two, hasn't she paid for it out of her own pocket? Whether they have the things or not, it sounds well. Just reckon it out. There are forty or fifty young ladies and maids to cater for, and each day we're only allowed two hens, two ducks and some ten catties of meat costing a string of cash — how far do you think that goes? It's not enough for the two proper meals, let alone all the extra dishes you keep ordering. You don't eat what's bought, you want other things instead. If this is the way, I'd better ask the mistress to increase our allowance and do as they do in the big kitchen where the old lady's meals are prepared, writing all the dishes in the world on a board and changing them round every day, settling accounts at the end of the month. Why, the other day when Miss Tanchun and Miss Baochai happened to feel like some bean-sprouts fried with oil and salt, they sent a maid with five hundred cash to me. I had to laugh.\n\n\"'Even if these two young ladies had the belly of Maitreya,' I said, 'they couldn't eat five hundred cash worth. This is a matter of twenty or thirty cash at most — we can manage that.' But when I took the money back they wouldn't have it. They told me to keep it to buy wine with, and said, 'Now that the kitchen's inside the Garden, we can't guarantee that the servants here won't demand things. Every grain of salt and every drop of soy sauce has to be paid for. If they ask and you refuse, that's awkward; but if you give them these things you'll be out of pocket. Take this money to make up to you for what they cadge.' Now those young ladies are really considerate. I couldn't help blessing them. But then Concubine Zhao heard of it and was so annoyed she had to put her oar in, saying I was getting too many perquisites. And less than ten days later she sent a young maid to ask for this and that. I had to laugh. It seems to have become a custom. If it isn't one thing it's another. How can I afford to make good so many losses?\"\n\nIn the middle of this argument another maid arrived from Chess to ask Lotus, \"Are you dead? Why don't you come back?\"\n\nLotus went back in a huff and gave Chess a full account of what had happened. This so incensed Chess that after waiting on Yingchun while she had her meal she went over with some younger maids. Seeing a number of people there having a meal and that Chess looked angry, they all rose to offer her a seat with a smile.\n\nBut Chess ordered her young maids, \"Throw out all the vegetables you find in the cupboards and feed them to the dogs! No one's going to make any money out of this.\"\n\nThe young maids were only too glad to obey.\n\nWith a crash all the maids rushed forward and started snatching things, throwing everything into confusion. While trying to calm them down the other women pleaded with Siqi:\n\n“Don’t take any notice of what that child says, miss. Mrs. Liu wouldn’t dare offend you, not if she had eight heads. It’s true eggs are hard to get. We told her she didn’t know what was good for her, and that she must get hold of some somehow, whatever it was. She saw our point then and steamed one at once. If you don’t believe us, look on the stove.”\n\nSiqi finally calmed down after this cajolery, and the young maids who had not finished smashing things were dragged away. Siqi went on scolding and making a scene for a while until the others persuaded her to leave. Mrs. Liu had to put up with the loss of her bowls and dishes. Muttering angrily to herself, she steamed an egg and sent it to Siqi, who flung the whole bowl on the ground. The maid who had taken it dared not report this, for fear of causing more trouble.\n\nAfter Mrs. Liu had made her daughter drink some soup and eat half a bowl of gruel, she told her about the Poria. When Wuer heard this she decided to share it with Fangguan. So she wrapped up half in paper and, seizing a chance when dusk fell and few people were about, flitted through the flowers and trees to look for Fangguan. She was lucky enough to meet with no one. Upon reaching Happy Red Court, not liking to go straight in, she stood waiting behind a rose trellis, gazing towards the house. She had been there for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea when Chunyan happened to come out, and she stepped forward to stop her.\n\nNot sure who it was in the dusk, Chunyan came closer to see.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\nWuer smiled. “Will you ask Fangguan to come out? I want a word with her.”\n\nChunyan chuckled. “Aren’t you in a hurry! She’ll be back in ten days or so; why look for her now? She’s been sent to the front court, but you can wait if you like. Or if it’s anything important, you can tell me and I’ll pass it on — only I’m afraid you may not want to wait so long, as the garden gate may be closed presently.”\n\nWuer then showed her the Poria and explained how to take it and how good it was as a tonic.\n\n“I’ve brought her this that was given to me,” she said. “Will you give it to her for me?”\n\nWith that she turned back. But as she was passing by Smartweed Bank she suddenly encountered Mrs. Lin with some other women. Unable to avoid them, she had to go up to greet them.\n\n“I heard you were ill,” said Mrs. Lin. “What are you doing here?”\n\nWuer forced a smile. “I’m a bit better these last couple of days. I came in with my mother for a change. And just now she sent me to Happy Red Court to return something.”\n\n“That’s a strange thing. I saw your mother go out, and that’s why I came to lock the gate. If she sent you to Happy Red Court, why didn’t she tell me you were here instead of going and leaving me to lock up? There’s something fishy about this. You’re telling me lies.”\n\nWuer could think of no answer.\n\n“My mother told me first thing this morning to go and fetch something, but I forgot,” she faltered. “I only remembered a short while ago. I suppose she thought I’d already gone and that’s why she didn’t tell you.”\n\nMrs. Lin, hearing how she hemmed and hawed and remembering that recently Yuchuan had reported the loss of some things from the main lodging-house — several maids were under suspicion but no decision had been reached — became rather suspicious. And now along came Xiaochan, Lotus and a few other matrons.\n\n“You’d better cross-examine her, Mrs. Lin,” they said. “The last couple of days she’s been forever coming here, slinking around in a very suspicious way. We don’t know what she’s up to.”\n\n“That’s right,” agreed Xiaochan. “Yesterday Sister Yuchuan said, ‘The cabinet in Her Ladyship’s anteroom’s been broken open and a lot of trifles are missing.’ And when the Second Young Mistress sent Pinger to ask Yuchuan for some rose flavoured juice, a whole bottle of it had gone. If they hadn’t looked for it, no one would have known.”\n\n“I didn’t hear that,” put in Lotus. “But today I saw a\n\n“I saw a bottle of flavoured syrup.” Mrs. Lin had been worried because this business was still not cleared up and Xifeng was sending Ping’er every day to urge her to get to the bottom of it. The mention of a bottle made her ask quickly where it was.\n\n“In their kitchen,” said Lotus.\n\nMrs. Lin promptly ordered lanterns to be lit and went with the others to search. In desperation Wuer said:\n\n“That was given me by Fangguan in Master Bao’s place.”\n\n“I don’t care if it was Fangguan or Yuanguan,” snapped Mrs. Lin. “Here’s the evidence of your theft. I shall just report it and you can argue it out with your mistress.”\n\nShe went into the kitchen, followed by Lotus who produced the bottle. Then, afraid there might be other stolen goods there, they made a careful search and discovered a packet of poria. This evidence too was taken, and they escorted Wuer to Li Wan and Tanchun.\n\nNow Li Wan, because Lan was ill, had stopped attending to affairs and simply sent them to Tanchun, who had gone back to her own quarters. When this was reported, as her maids were enjoying the cool in the courtyard, Tanchun was having a bath inside and only Shishu went in to tell her. After some time she came out.\n\n“The young lady says she knows,” she announced. “She wants you to find Ping’er and report this to the Second Mistress.”\n\nMrs. Lin had to take her party to Xifeng’s apartments. First they found Ping’er and reported the matter to her, and she passed it on to Xifeng. Xifeng, who had just gone to bed, ordered:\n\n“Give the mother forty strokes of the bamboo and drive her out, never to set foot inside the inner gate again. Give Wuer forty strokes too, then send her at once to the farm to be sold or married off.”\n\nPing’er passed on these orders to Mrs. Lin. Wuer, crying hysterically, knelt down before her to explain how Fangguan had given her the syrup.\n\n“That’s easy to check,” said Ping’er. “I’ll ask Fangguan tomorrow and find out the truth. But that poria was sent the other day, and we were waiting for Their Ladyships to come back before touching it. It shouldn’t have been stolen.”\n\nWuer then explained how her uncle had given it to her. At that Ping’er smiled.\n\n“In that case you’re completely innocent, and someone else is to blame. But it’s late now. The mistress has taken medicine and gone to sleep, and it’s no time to bother her with such a trifle. Have her kept under guard by the women on night duty, and tomorrow when I report to Her Ladyship we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nNot daring to object, Mrs. Lin had to take Wuer away and hand her over to the women on duty, after which she went home.\n\nWuer, thus held in custody, dared not take a step in any direction. Some of the women urged her to admit her guilt, others grumbled, “We can’t even sit down properly on our shift, and now we’ve a thief to keep watch over. If we don’t watch out and she hangs herself or runs away, that will be our fault.”\n\nThen there were those on bad terms with Liu and her daughter, who were overjoyed by this and came to mock at Wuer. She was frantic with indignation but had no way to justify herself. Besides, she was a delicate, ailing girl. That whole night she had no tea or water or a pillow or coverlet for her bed; and she sobbed the whole night through.\n\nBut those who bore a grudge against her and her mother were afraid the next day might bring some new development. They got up early and went on the quiet to bribe Ping’er with presents, praising her for the efficient way she handled matters and telling her all the bad things they knew about Liu. Ping’er assented to all they said. When she had got rid of them she went to see Xiren and asked whether Fangguan had really given Wuer the rose flavoured syrup.\n\n“Yes, I gave it to Fangguan,” said Xiren. “But whom she passed it on to, I don’t know.”\n\nXiren then asked Fangguan, who was consternated and admitted giving it to Wuer. She told Baoyu this, and he was alarmed too.\n\nShe smiled and said, “I know who has the pachyma, but if she’s taxed with it she’ll naturally confess and implicate Poria too. And if we say she got it from her uncle, he’ll get into trouble again too. In return for his kindness to us, wouldn’t it be mean to make out that he put her up to this?”\n\nShe hastily took Pinger aside to whisper, “We’ve got to the bottom of the pachyma business, but this Poria is a problem too. Do make her say Fangguan gave it to her, dear sister.”\n\n“That’s all very well,” said Pinger. “But last night she told someone her uncle gave it to her. How can she now say you did? Besides, as that Poria was lost and no one owns up to taking it, if we let the one caught with it off and try to pin it on someone else, who will admit it? Who’ll own up? The others won’t be convinced either.”\n\nJust then Qingwen came in.\n\n“Nobody but Caiyun in the mistress’ place could have stolen that pachyma for Master Huan,” she announced. “What nonsense you’re talking!”\n\n“Who doesn’t know that?” Pinger smiled. “But Yuchuan’s so upset, she’s crying. If we question Caiyun on the quiet and she admits it, Yuchuan will be in the clear and we can drop the matter. Who wants to make trouble? The annoying thing is that not only won’t Caiyun own up, she’s accusing Yuchuan of stealing the things. Their squabble has set the whole household by the ears; so how can we pretend to know nothing about it? We’ve got to investigate. But although the one who reports a theft is often the thief, there’s no evidence; so how can we accuse her?”\n\n“All right,” said Baoyu. “I’ll take the blame. I’ll say I took the things from the mistress for fun, to frighten them. That will cover both cases.”\n\n“A good deed, saving them from being branded as thieves,” said Xiren. “But when the mistress hears it she’ll scold you for being childish and not knowing what’s good for you.”\n\n“That’s a small matter,” replied Pinger. “It would be easy to find the stolen goods in Concubine Zhao’s place, but I’m afraid of hurting an innocent person’s feelings. Never mind the rest, but if this one person is upset won’t that be too bad? I’m sorry for her. I don’t want to break a jade vase while hitting a rat.” She held up three fingers as she spoke.\n\nXiren and the others knew that she meant Tanchun.\n\n“You’re right,” they cried. “Better for us to take the blame.”\n\nPinger smiled.\n\n“We must send for those two wretches Caiyun and Yuchuan and get them to confess,” she said. “Otherwise, if they think they’ve got away with it they won’t credit us with having hushed up the business, and from now on they’ll go on stealing or not as they please.”\n\n“Quite right,” agreed Xiren. “You must cover yourself.”\n\nPinger ordered someone to fetch the two girls.\n\nWhen they came she said, “There’s no need to worry. The thief has been found.”\n\n“Who is it?” asked Yuchuan.\n\n“She’s in the Second Mistress’ room now,” Pinger told her. “She admits everything she’s asked. I know quite well she didn’t steal the things, but she’s so scared she’s confessed. Master Bao is sorry for her and wants to take half the blame. If I tell on the real thief, she’s a good friend of mine; and the receiver is nobody special, but an innocent person would be involved and that would hurt the reputation of a good family. So there’s nothing for it but to ask Master Bao to take the blame, so that we can drop the matter. Now I want to know what you two propose to do. If from now on you’ll be more careful and not lose face again, I’ll ask Master Bao to take the rap. If not, I shall report this to the Second Mistress. I don’t want to wrong anyone.”\n\nWhen Caiyun heard this she flushed. Overcome by shame she exclaimed:\n\n“Set your mind at rest, sister. Don’t wrong good people. I’ll tell the truth. It was Concubine Zhao who kept begging me to help her, and not wanting to lose face she stole the things.”\n\n\"I was perfectly sincere when I gave some to Master Huan,\" said Caiyun. \"Why, even when the mistress is at home we take things to give away sometimes. I said we'd get to the bottom of this in a couple of days; but now that someone's been wrongfully accused, I can't bear it. Take me to the mistress, sister, and I'll confess everything.\"\n\nThey were all amazed by her pluck.\n\n\"You really are an honest soul,\" Baoyu told her with a smile. \"There's no need for you to confess. I'll say I stole the things just for fun to scare you all, and now that there's been this fuss I admit it. I just beg you sisters not to make such a commotion in future, then all will be well.\"\n\n\"Why should you take the blame for what I did?\" she retorted. \"I'm the one who should be punished.\"\n\nPinger and Xiren expostulated, \"It's not that. If you confess, the whole story of Concubine Zhao may come out, and when Miss Tanchun hears of it she'll be angry again. Better let Master Bao take the blame so that no one gets into trouble. Besides, only a few of us know the truth, so this is the cleanest way. We must just be more careful in future. If you want anything, wait till the mistress comes back. Even if she gives the whole house away, it's none of our business.\"\n\nCaiyun lowered her head and thought this over, then finally agreed.\n\nSo the matter was settled. Pinger took her, Baoyu and Fangguan to the room where the night watch was kept, and sent for Wuer, telling her quietly to say that the Poria cocos powder had been a present from Fangguan. Wuer was very grateful.\n\nPinger then took them to her own apartments, where she found Lin Zhixiao's wife with some other matrons who had brought along Liu's wife some time ago.\n\n\"I brought her here first thing this morning,\" said Lin Zhixiao's wife. \"But as I was afraid there might be no one to see to the young ladies' breakfast in the Garden, I sent Qin Xian's wife to do it temporarily.\"\n\n\"Who is Qin Xian's wife?\" asked Pinger. \"I don't seem to know her.\"\n\n\"She's on night duty at the south corner of the Garden, so she has nothing to do in the daytime. That's why you don't know her, miss. She has high cheekbones and big eyes, and is very clean and capable.\"\n\n\"I know,\" put in Yuchuan. \"Have you forgotten, sister? She's Sigi's aunt. Sigi's father works for the Elder Master, but his uncle is on our side.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, now I know who you mean,\" cried Pinger. Then she remarked, \"But you were too hasty. Now this business is completely cleared up, and we know who took the things missing from the mistress' room the other day too. The other day when Baoyu called there, he asked these two little wretches for something, and they played a trick on him by saying they dared not take anything while the mistress was away. So he slipped in when they weren't looking and helped himself. These two silly creatures didn't know that, and got scared. Now that Baoyu has heard that others are being blamed, he's told me the whole story and shown me the things — they're all there. That Poria cocos powder was given him by someone outside, and he's given some to quite a few people, not only those in the Garden but even to some nurses who asked for it to take home for their relatives or to give away. Xiren gave some to Fangguan and the other actresses. It's quite usual for them to exchange little presents. The other day two hampers of the stuff were left in the hall and nobody touched them, so how can we accuse people wrongly? I shall report this to the mistress.\"\n\nWith that she went into her bedroom and repeated this to Xifeng.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Xifeng. \"But Baoyu's the sort who, regardless of right and wrong, loves to take things on himself. If other people beg him, he can't refuse them....\"\n\nJust say something nice to flatter him and he’ll agree to anything. If we take his word for it and in future let important matters slide too, how are we to keep people under control? We must investigate this carefully. My idea is to have all the maids from Her Ladyship’s apartments brought here. Although we can’t very well have them beaten, we can make them kneel in the sun on broken china, without any food or drink. Those who won’t confess can go on kneeling for days; even if they’re made of iron, in one day they’ll confess.”\n\nShe continued, “Flies don’t swarm round an egg that’s not cracked. Even if this Liu woman didn’t steal, there must have been some reason for people to accuse her. We needn’t punish her as a thief, but she must be dismissed. Even the court has cases of wrongful dismissal; so she won’t be badly treated.”\n\n“Why worry about such a trifle?” asked Pinger. “We should be ready to let people off whenever possible. Why not show some generosity? In my opinion, no matter how much trouble you take here, in the end we shall be going back to the other house; so why incur the resentment of petty people and make them bear you a grudge? Besides, you’ve been ailing a lot yourself. You were lucky to conceive a son, but you miscarried in the sixth or seventh month — who knows but that wasn’t brought on by overwork and worry? Why not shut your eyes to much of this and let things slide? That would be better for you.”\n\nThis made Xifeng smile.\n\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “I don’t want to argue.”\n\n“Isn’t that only reasonable?” Pinger smiled too.\n\nHaving had her way she went out to announce their decision.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
