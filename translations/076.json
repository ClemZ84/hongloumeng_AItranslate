  "original": "话说贾赦、贾政带领贾珍等散去不提。且说贾母这里命将围屏撤去，两席并作一席。众媳妇另行擦桌整果，更杯洗箸，陈设一番。贾母等都添了衣，盥漱吃茶，方又坐下，团团围绕。贾母看时，宝钗姊妹二人不在坐内，知他家去圆月，且李纨、凤姐二人又病，少了这四个人，便觉冷清了好些。贾母因笑道：“往年你老爷们不在家，咱们都是请过姨太太来大家赏月，却十分热闹。忽一时想起你老爷来，又不免想到母子夫妻儿女不能一处，也都没兴。及至今年你老爷来了，正该大家团圆取乐，又不便请他们娘儿们来说笑说笑，况且他们今年又添了两口人，也难撂下他们跑到这里来。偏又把凤丫头病了，有他一个人说说笑笑，还抵得十个人的空儿。可见天下事总难十全！”说毕，不觉长叹一声，随命拿大杯来斟热酒。王夫人笑道：“今日得母子团圆，自比往年有趣。往年娘儿们虽多，终不似今年骨肉齐全的好。”贾母笑道：“正是为此，所以我才高兴，拿大杯来吃酒。你们也换大杯才是。”邢夫人等只得换上大杯来。因夜深体乏，且不能胜酒，未免都有些倦意。无奈贾母兴犹未阑，只得陪饮。贾母又命将毡毯铺在阶上，命将月饼、西瓜、果品等类都叫搬下去，命丫头媳妇们也都团团围坐赏月。\n　　贾母因见月至天中，比先越发精彩可爱，因说：“如此好月，不可不闻笛。”因命又将十番上女子传来。贾母道：“音乐多了，反失雅致，只用吹笛的远远的吹起来，就够了。”说毕，刚才去吹时，只见跟邢夫人的媳妇走来向邢夫人说了两句话。贾母便问：“什么事？”邢夫人便回说：“方才大老爷出去，被石头绊了一下，歪了腿。”贾母听说，忙命两个婆子快看去，又命邢夫人快去。邢夫人遂告辞起身。贾母便又说：“珍哥媳妇也趁便儿就家去罢，我也就睡了。”尤氏笑道：“我今日不回去了，定要和老祖宗吃一夜。”贾母笑道：“使不得。你们小两口儿今夜要团团圆圆的，如何为我耽搁了？”尤氏红了脸，笑道：“老祖宗说的我们太不堪了。虽是我们年轻，已经是二十来年的夫妻，也奔四十岁的人了，况且孝服未满。陪着老太太玩一夜是正理。”贾母听说，笑道：“这话很是。我倒也忘了孝未满。可怜你公公已死了二年多了！可是我倒忘了，该罚我一大杯。既这样，你就别送，竟陪着我罢。叫蓉儿媳妇送去，就顺便回去罢。”尤氏说给贾蓉媳妇答应着，送出邢夫人，一同至大门，各自上车回去，不在话下。\n　　这里众人赏了一回桂花，又入席换暖酒来。正说着闲话，猛不防那壁里桂花树下，呜咽悠扬，吹出笛声来。趁着这明月清风，天空地静，真令人烦心顿释，万虑齐除，肃然危坐，默然相赏。听约两盏茶时，方才止住。大家称赞不已，于是遂又斟上暖酒来，贾母笑道：“果然好听么？”众人笑道：“实在好听。我们也想不到这样，须得老太太带领着，我们也得开些心儿。”贾母道：“这还不大好，须得拣那曲谱越慢的吹来越好听。”便命斟一大杯酒送给吹笛之人，慢慢的吃了再细细的吹一套来。媳妇们答应了。方送去，只见方才看贾赦的两个婆子回来说：“瞧了。右脚面上白肿了些。如今调服了药，疼的好些了，也没大关系。”贾母点头叹道：“我也太操心！打紧说我偏心，我反这样。”\n　　说着，鸳鸯拿巾兜与大斗篷来，说：“夜深了，恐露水下了，风吹了头，坐坐也该歇了。”贾母道：“偏今儿高兴，你又来催。难道我醉了不成？偏要坐到天亮。”因命再斟来，一面戴上兜巾，披了斗篷，大家陪着又饮，说些笑话。只听桂花阴里又发出一缕笛音来，果然比先越发凄凉，大家都寂然而坐。夜静月明，众人不禁伤感，忙转身陪笑发语解释，又命换酒止笛。尤氏笑说道：“我也就学了一个笑话，说给老太太解闷儿。”贾母勉强笑道：“这样更好，快说来我听。”尤氏乃说道：“一家子，养了四个儿子。大儿子只一个眼睛；二儿子只一个耳朵；三儿子只一个鼻子眼；四儿子倒都齐全，偏又是个哑吧。”正说到这里，只见席上贾母已朦胧双眼，似有睡去之态。尤氏方住了，忙和王夫人轻轻叫请。贾母睁眼笑道：“我不困，白闭闭眼养神。你们只管说，我听着呢。”王夫人笑道：“夜已深了，风露也大，请老太太安歇罢了，明日再赏。十六月色也好。”贾母道：“什么时候？”王夫人笑道：“已交四更，他们姊妹们熬不过，都去睡了。”贾母听说，细看了一看，果然都散了，只有探春一人在此。贾母笑道：“也罢。他们也熬不惯，况且弱的弱，病的病，去了倒省心。只是三丫头可怜，尚还等着。你也去罢，我们散了。”说着便起身，吃了一口清茶，便坐竹椅小轿，两个婆子搭起，众人围随出园去了，不在话下。\n　　这里众媳妇收拾杯盘，却少了个细茶杯，各处寻觅不见。又问众人：“必是失手打了。撂在那里？告诉我，拿了磁瓦去交，好作证见。不然，又说偷起来了。”众人都说，没有打碎。只怕跟姑娘的人打了，也未可知。你细想想，或问问他们去？”一语提醒了那媳妇，笑道：“是了。那一会记得是翠缕拿着的，我去问他。”说着便找时，刚到了甬道，就遇见紫鹃和翠缕来了。翠缕便问道：“老太太散了？可知我们姑娘那里去了？”这媳妇道：“我来问你一个茶钟那里去了，你倒问我要姑娘。”翠缕笑道：“我因倒茶给姑娘喝来着，展眼回头连姑娘也没了。”那媳妇道：“太太才说，都睡觉去了。你不知那里玩去了，还不知道呢。”翠缕和紫鹃道，“断乎没有悄悄儿睡去的，只怕在那里走了一走，如今老太太走了，赶过前边送去，也未可知，我们且往前边找去。有了姑娘，自然，你的茶钟也有了。你明日一早再找罢，有什么忙的。”媳妇笑道：“有了下落就不必忙了，明儿和你要罢。”说毕回去查收家伙。这里紫鹃和翠缕便往贾母处来，不在话下。\n　　原来黛玉和湘云二人并未去睡。只因黛玉见贾府中许多人赏月，贾母犹叹人少，又想宝钗姐妹家去，母女弟兄自去赏月，不觉对景感怀，自去倚栏垂泪。宝玉近因晴雯病势甚重，诸务无心，王夫人再四遣他去睡，他从此去了。探春又因近日家事恼着，无心游玩。虽有迎春、惜春二人，偏又素日不大甚合，所以只剩湘云一人宽慰他。因说：“你是个明白人，还不自己保养。可恨宝姐姐、琴妹妹天天说亲道热，早已说今年中秋要大家一处赏月，必要起诗社，大家联句。到今日，便扔下咱们自己赏月去了，社也散了，诗也不做了。倒是他们父子叔侄纵横起来，你可知宋太祖说的好：‘卧榻之侧，岂容他人酣睡？’他们不来，咱们两个竟联起句来，明日羞他们一羞。”黛玉见他这般劝慰，也不肯负他的豪兴，因笑道：“你看这里边等人声杂，有何诗兴！”湘云笑道：“这山上赏月虽好，总不及近水赏月更妙。你知道这山坡底下就是池沿。山凹里近水一个所在，就是凹晶馆。可知当日盖这园子，就有学问。这山之高处，就叫凸碧；山之低洼近水处，就叫凹晶。这‘凸’‘凹’二字，历来用的人最少，如今直用作轩馆之名，更觉新鲜，不落巢臼。可知这两处，一上一下，一明一暗，一高一矮，一山一水，竟是特因玩月而设此处。有爱那山高月小的，便往这里来，有爱那皓月清波的，便往那里去，只是这两个字俗念作‘洼’‘拱’二音，便说俗了，不大见用。只陆放翁用了一个‘凹’字，‘古砚微凹聚墨多’，还有人批他俗，岂不可笑？”黛玉道：“也不只放翁才用，古人中用者太多。如《青苔赋》，东方朔《神异经》，以至《画记》上云‘张僧繇画一乘寺’的故事，不可胜举。只是今日不知，误作俗字用了。实和你说罢：这两个字，还是我拟的呢。因那年试宝玉，宝玉拟了未妥，我们拟写出来，送给大姐姐，我们拟写出来，送给大姐姐瞧了。他又带出来，命给舅舅瞧过，所以都用了。如今咱们就往凹晶馆去。”\n　　说着，二人同下山坡，只一转弯就是。池沿上一带竹栏相接，直通着那边藕香榭的路径。只有两个婆子上夜，因知在凸碧山庄赏月，与他们无干，早已息灯睡了。黛玉、湘云见息了灯，都笑道：“倒是他们睡了好，咱们就在卷篷底下赏这水月何如？”二人遂在两个竹墩上坐下。只见天上一轮皓月，池中一个月影，上下争辉，如置身于晶宫鲛室之内。微风一过，粼粼然池面皱碧叠纹，真令人神清气爽。湘云笑道：“怎么得这会子上船吃酒才好。要是在我家里，我就立刻坐船了。”黛玉道：“正是古人常说的：‘事若求全何所乐？’据我说，这也罢了，何必偏要坐船。”湘云笑道：“得陇望蜀，人之常情。”\n　　正说间，只听笛韵悠扬起来。黛玉笑道：“今日老太太、太太高兴，这笛子吹的有趣，倒是助咱们的兴趣了。咱们两个都爱五言，就还是五言排律罢。”湘云道：“什么韵？”黛玉笑道：“咱们数这个栏杆上的直棍，这头到那头为止，他是第几根，就是第几韵。”湘云笑道：“这倒别致。”于是二人起身，便从头数至尽头，止得十三根。湘云道：“偏又是‘十三元’了，这个韵可用的少，你排律只怕牵强不能压韵呢。少不得你先起一句罢了。”黛玉笑道：“倒要试试咱们谁强谁弱。只是没有纸笔记。”湘云道：“明儿再写，只怕这一点聪明儿还有。”黛玉道：“我先起一句现成的俗语罢。”因念道。\n　　三五中秋夕，\n　　湘云想了一想，道：\n　　情游拟上元。撒天箕斗灿，\n　　黛玉笑道：\n　　匝地管弦繁。几处狂飞盏？\n　　湘云笑道：“这一句‘几处狂飞盏’有些意思。这倒要对得好呢。”想了一想，笑道：\n　　谁家不启轩？轻寒风剪剪，\n　　黛玉道：“好对！比我的却好。只是这句又说俗话了，就该加劲说了去才是。”湘云笑道：“诗多韵险，也要铺陈些才是。纵有好的，且留在后头。”黛玉笑道：“到后头没有好的，我看你羞不羞。”因联道：\n　　良夜景暄暄。争饼嘲黄发，\n　　湘云笑道：“这句不好，杜撰。用俗事来难我了。”黛玉笑道：“我说你不曾见过书呢，‘吃饼’是旧典。《唐书》《唐志》，你看了来再说。”湘云笑道：“这也难不倒，我也有了。”因联道：\n　　分瓜笑绿媛。香新荣玉桂，\n　　黛玉道：“这可实实是你的杜撰了。”湘云笑道：“明日咱们对查了出来，大家看看，这会子别耽搁工夫。黛玉笑道：“虽如此，下句也不好。不犯又用‘玉桂’‘金兰’等字样来塞责。”因联道：\n　　色健茂金萱。蜡烛辉琼宴，\n　　湘云笑道：“‘金萱’二字，便宜了你，省了多少力！这样现成的韵，被你得了。只不犯着替他们颂圣去。况且下句你也是塞责了。”黛玉笑道：“你不说‘玉桂’，我难道强对个‘金萱’罢？再也要铺陈些富丽，方是即景之实事。”湘云只得又联道：\n　　觥筹乱绮园。分曹尊一令，\n　　黛玉笑道：“下句好。只难对些。”因想了一想，联道：\n　　射覆听三宣。骰彩红成点，\n　　湘云笑道：“‘三宣’有趣，竟化俗成雅了。只是下句又说上银子！”少不得联道：\n　　传花鼓滥喧。晴光摇院宇，\n　　黛玉笑道：“对得却好。下句又溜了，只管拿些风月来塞责吗？”湘云道：“究竟没说到月上，也要点缀点缀，方不落题。”黛玉道：“且姑存之，明日再斟酌。”因联道：\n　　素彩接乾坤。赏罚无宾主，\n　　湘云道：“又倒说他们做什么？不如说咱们。”因联道：\n　　吟诗序仲昆。构思时倚槛，\n　　黛玉道：“这可以入上你我了。”因联道：\n　　拟句或依门。酒尽情犹在，\n　　湘云说道：“这时候了！”乃联道：\n　　更残乐已谖。渐闻语笑寂，\n　　黛玉说道：“这时候，可知一步难似一步了。”因联道：\n　　空剩雪霜痕。阶露团朝菌，\n　　湘云道：“这一句怎么叶韵？让我想想。”因起身负手想了一想，笑道：“够了，幸而想出一个字来，不然几乎败了。”因联道：\n　　庭烟敛夕棔。秋湍泻石髓，\n　　黛玉听了，不禁也起身叫妙，说：“这促狭鬼！果然留下好的。这会子方说‘’字，亏你想得出。”湘云道：“幸而昨日看《历朝文选》，见了这个字。我不知是何树，因要查一查，宝姐姐说：‘不用查，这就是如今俗叫做“朝开夜合”的。’我信不及，到底查了一查，果然不错。看来宝姐姐知道的竟多。”黛玉笑道：“‘’字用在此时更恰，也还罢了。只是‘秋湍’一句，亏你好想。只这一句，别的都要抹倒，我少不得打起精神来对这一句，只是再不能似这一句了。”因想了又想，方对道：\n　　风中聚云根。宝婺情孤洁，\n　　湘云道：“这对得也还好。只是这一句，你也溜了。幸而是景中情，不单用‘宝婺’来塞责。”因联道：\n　　银蟾气吐吞。药催灵兔捣，\n　　黛玉不语点头，半日遂念道：\n　　人向广寒奔。犯斗邀牛女，\n　　湘云也望月点首，联道：\n　　乘槎访帝孙。盈虚轮莫定，\n　　黛玉道：“对句不好，合掌。下句推开一步，倒还是‘急脉缓灸法’。”因又联道：\n　　晦朔魄空存，壶漏声将涸，\n　　湘云方欲联时，黛玉指池中黑影与湘云看道：“你看那河里，怎么象个人到黑影里去了？敢是个鬼？”湘云笑道：“可是又见鬼了！我是不怕鬼的，等我打他一下。”因弯腰拾了一块小石片，向那池中打去。只听打得水响，一个大圆圈将月影激荡，散而复聚者几次。只听那黑影里“嘎”的一声，却飞起一个白鹤来，直往藕香榭去了。黛玉笑道：“原是他，猛然想不到，反吓了一跳。”湘云笑道：“正是这个鹤有趣，倒助了我了。”因联道：\n　　窗灯焰已昏。寒塘渡鹤影，\n　　黛玉听了，又叫好，又跺足，说：“了不得了，这鹤真是助他的了！这一句更比‘秋湍’不同，叫我对什么才好？‘影’字只有一个‘魂’字可对。况且‘寒塘渡鹤’，何等自然，何等现成，何等有景，且又新鲜，我竟要搁笔了。”湘云笑道：“大家细想就有了，不然，就放着明日再联也可。”黛玉只看天，不理他，半日，猛然笑道：“你不必捞嘴，我也有了，你听听。”因对道：\n　　冷月葬花魂。\n　　湘云拍手赞道：“果然好极，非此不能对。好个‘葬花魂’！”因又叹道：“诗固新奇，只是太颓丧了些。你现病着，不该作此过于凄清奇谲之语。”黛玉笑道：“不如此，如何压倒你？只为用工在这一句了。”\n　　一语未了，只见栏外山石后转出一个人来，笑道：“好诗，好诗，果然太悲凉了，不必再往下做。若底下只这样去，反不显这两句了，倒弄的堆砌牵强。”二人不防，倒吓了一跳。细看时不是别人，却是妙玉。二人皆诧异，因问：“你如何到了这里？”妙玉笑道：“我听见你们大家赏月，又吹得好笛，我也出来玩赏这清池皓月。倾脚走到这里，忽听见你们两个吟诗，更觉清雅异常，故此就听住了。只是方才我听见这一首中，有几句虽好，只是过于颓败凄楚。此亦关人之气数，所以我出来止住你们。如今老太太都早已散了，满园的人想俱已睡熟了，你两个的丫头还不知在那里找你们呢，你们也不怕冷了？快同我来，到我那里去吃杯茶，只怕就天亮了。”黛玉笑道：“谁知道就这个时候了。”\n　　三人遂一同来至栊翠用中，只见龛焰犹青，炉香未烬。几个老道婆也都睡了，只有小丫头在蒲团上垂头打盹，妙玉唤起来现烹茶。忽听扣门之声，小丫鬟忙开门看时，却是紫鹃翠缕和几个老嬷嬷，来找他姊妹两个。进来见他们正吃茶，因都笑道：“叫我们好找。一个园子里走遍了，连姨太太那里都找到了。那小亭里找时，可巧那里上夜的正睡醒了，我们问他们，他们说：‘方才亭外头棚下两个人说话，后来又添了一个人，听见说大家往庵里去。’我们就知道这里来了。”妙玉忙命丫鬟，引们到那边去坐着歇息吃茶。自却取了笔砚纸墨出来，将方才的诗命他二人念着，遂从头写出来。黛玉见他今日十分高兴，便笑道：“从来没见你这样高兴，我也不敢唐突请教，这还可以见教否？若不堪时，便就烧了；若或可改，即请改正改正。”妙玉笑道：“也不敢妄评。只是这才有二十二韵。我意思想着你二位警句已出，再续时，倒恐后力不加。我竟要续貂，又恐有玷。”黛玉从没见妙玉做过诗，今见他高兴如此，忙说：“果然如此，我们虽不好，亦可以带好了。”妙玉道：“如今收结，到底还归到本来面目上去。若只管丢了真情真事，且去搜奇检怪，一则失了咱们的闺阁面目，二则也与题目无涉了。”林、史二人皆道：“极是。”妙玉提笔微吟，一挥而就，递与他二人道：“休要见笑。依我必须如此，方翻转过来。虽前头有凄楚之句，亦无甚碍了。”二人接了看时，只见他续道：\n　　香篆销金鼎，冰脂腻玉盆。\n　　箫憎嫠妇泣，衾倩侍儿温。\n　　空帐悲文凤，闲屏设彩鸳。\n　　露浓苔更滑，霜重竹难扪。\n　　犹步萦纡沼，还登寂历原。\n　　石奇神鬼缚，木怪虎狼蹲。\n　　赑屭朝光透，罘罳晓露屯。\n　　振林千树鸟，啼谷一声猿。\n　　歧熟焉忘径？泉知不问源。\n　　钟鸣栊翠寺，鸡唱稻香村。\n　　有兴悲何极？无愁意岂烦？\n　　芳情只自遣，雅趣向谁言！\n　　彻旦休云倦，烹茶更细论。\n　　后书“右中秋夜大观园即景联句三十五韵”。\n　　黛玉湘云二人称赞不已，说：“可见咱们天天是舍近求远。现有这样诗人在此，却天天去纸上谈兵。”妙玉笑道：“明日再润色。此时已天明了，到底也歇息歇息才是。”林、史二人听说，便起身告辞，带领了丫鬟出来。妙玉送至门外，看他们去远方掩门进来，不在话下。这里翠缕向湘云道：“大奶奶那里还有人等着咱们睡去呢。如今还是那里去好。”湘云笑道：“你顺路告诉他们，叫他们睡罢。我这一去，未免惊动病人，不如闹林姑娘去罢。”说着，大家走至潇湘馆中。有一半人已睡去。二人进去了，卸妆宽衣，盥洗巳毕，方上床安歇。紫鹃放下绡帐，移灯掩门出去。谁知湘云有择席之病，虽在枕上，只是睡不着。黛玉又是个心血不足，常常不眠的，今日又错过困头，自然也是睡不着。二人在枕上翻来覆去。黛玉因问道：“怎么还睡不着？”湘云微笑道：“我有个择席的病，况且走了困，只好躺躺儿罢。你怎么也睡不着？”黛玉叹道：“我这睡不着也并非一日了。大约一年之中，通共也只好睡十夜满足的觉。”湘云道：“你这病就怪不得了。”\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Jia She and Jia Zhen had led the others away, the Lady Dowager had the screens removed and the two tables of feasts joined together. The matrons cleared the tables and replenished them with fruit, then fetched clean cups and chopsticks and rearranged everything. The Lady Dowager and the others, who had put on extra clothes, washed their hands and rinsed their mouths, then sat down again in a close circle.\n\nNoticing that Baochai and Baoqin were not there, she knew that they had gone home to enjoy the moon. And as Li Wan and Xifeng were both ill, the absence of these four made the party seem rather quiet.\n\n“In other years, when your fathers were away,” she remarked, “we used to invite your aunt Xue over to enjoy the moon, and we had a fine lively time. But then I’d think of your fathers and feel sad that mothers and sons, husbands and wives, couldn’t all be together. This year, now that your fathers are back, we should have a family reunion — but then it didn’t seem right to ask them over, especially as there are two more in their family now; we could hardly expect them to leave their own party to join us. And now Xifeng’s fallen ill too. She alone can take the place of a dozen people. It just shows, nothing in this world is ever perfect.”\n\nShe sighed and called for large cups to be heated and filled with warm wine.\n\n“This year, with mother and sons together, it’s so much better than other years,” said Lady Wang. “Even though we had more women here before, it’s not as good as having the whole family together.”\n\n“That’s why I’m so pleased that I want to drink from a large cup. You must all do the same.”\n\nLady Xing and the others had to change to large cups too. But as it was late and they were tired, not being good drinkers they were beginning to feel drowsy. However, the old lady was still in high spirits and they had to keep her company.\n\nShe ordered rugs to be spread on the steps and all the mooncakes, watermelons and other fruit to be carried down there, then made the maids and matrons sit round in a circle to enjoy the moon too.\n\nAs the moon was now right overhead, more brilliant and lovely than ever, the Lady Dowager exclaimed, “This is too fine a moon to miss hearing some fluting.” She sent to invite the girls from the Ten Grades band.\n\n“Too much music would spoil the effect,” she said. “One flute far away would be just the thing.”\n\nBut then one of Lady Xing’s matrons came up and whispered something to her mistress.\n\n“What is it?” the Lady Dowager asked.\n\nLady Xing answered, “Just now, when the Elder Master went out, he stumbled over a stone and sprained his leg.”\n\nThe old lady at once sent two matrons to see how he was, and told Lady Xing to go back too. Lady Xing took her leave then and there.\n\n“You’d better go home too, Zhen’s wife,” said the Lady Dowager. “I shall be turning in soon.”\n\n“I’m not going back today,” said Madam You smiling. “I mean to keep you company the whole night.”\n\n“That won’t do. You young couples should keep each other company tonight on this festival. Why should you stay with me?”\n\nMadam You flushed. “You’re making fun of us, Old Ancestress,” she protested. “Though we’re young, we’ve been married for twenty years and are pushing forty. Besides, we’re still in mourning. It’s only right that I should keep you company.”\n\n“That’s true, I’d forgotten you were still in mourning,” said the Lady Dowager. “Poor things, your father-in-law’s been dead two years or more — I’d forgotten. Very well, I deserve to be fined with a big cup. In that case, don’t see Aunt Xing off but stay with me. Let Rong’s wife see her out, then she can go home too.”\n\nMadam You passed on this order to Jia Rong’s wife, who saw Lady Xing out to the main gate before driving home.\n\nThe others meanwhile enjoyed the fragrance of the osmanthus and then returned to the feast to drink warm wine. As they chatted, suddenly from under the osmanthus tree by the wall they heard the clear, mellow sound of fluting, which in that limpid moonlight and fresh breeze\n\nThe stillness was broken by the sound of flutes wafting from the osmanthus grove. So soothing was the music that everyone fell under its spell and sat rapt in silence. After listening for the time it takes to drink two cups of tea, the flutes stopped and they all exclaimed in admiration. More warm wine was poured.\n\n“Does it really sound good?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Excellent!” they replied. “We’d never have thought of this if you hadn’t suggested it, madam. It’s most diverting.”\n\n“It’s not too bad yet,” she said. “But the slower the air the better. Get the flautist a big cup of wine and tell him to take his time in drinking it before playing another air slowly.”\n\nThe serving-women assented. But as they were taking the wine they saw the two matrons sent to inquire after Jia She return and report, “We found that the master’s right foot is rather swollen, but after taking medicine the pain is less and it’s nothing serious.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded and sighed, “I’m too prone to worry. When they accuse me of being biased, this is what happens.”\n\nJust then Yuanyang brought her a scarf and a cape.\n\n“It’s late,” she said. “There’s dew now and the wind is chilly. You’ve sat here long enough, madam; it’s time to rest.”\n\n“How annoying!” exclaimed the Lady Dowager. “I’m enjoying myself and you come pestering me. Do you think I’m drunk? I mean to sit here till dawn.” She ordered more wine and put on the scarf and cape, then went on drinking with the others and chatting.\n\nNow from the osmanthus grove came the sound of flutes again, this time more mournful. All the company sat listening in silence. The night was still, the moon bright, and they were rather overcome. To dispel this mood they made conversation, called for hot wine and told the flautists to stop.\n\n“I know a joke,” said Madam You. “Let me tell it to amuse you, madam.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager forced a smile. “Good, let’s hear it.”\n\n“This is the story of a family with four sons,” began Madam You. “The eldest had only one eye, the second only one ear, the third only one nostril, and the fourth was all there but dumb....”\n\nAt this point she noticed that the old lady had closed her eyes and seemed to be dozing off. She broke off and she and Lady Wang gently called her name. The Lady Dowager opened her eyes and laughed.\n\n“I’m not sleepy, I was just closing my eyes to rest them. Go on with your story, I’m listening.”\n\n“It’s very late, and there’s dew,” said Lady Wang. “Won’t you go to bed, madam? You can enjoy the moonlight again tomorrow — it will be full on the sixteenth.”\n\n“What time is it?”\n\n“The fourth watch has started. All the young people can’t keep their eyes open and have gone to bed.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager looked round and saw that this was true; only Tanchun was still there.\n\n“Well, they’re not used to staying up,” she said. “And some of them are delicate or ailing. They may as well go and rest. But poor Tanchun’s still waiting. All right, you can go too. We’ll break up.” She stood up and sipped a mouthful of clear tea, then was carried back in her bamboo sedan-chair, escorted by the others. But no more of this.\n\nThe serving-women left behind to clear up found one small tea-cup missing. They searched high and low but without success.\n\n“It must have been broken,” said one. “Well, where are the pieces? If you tell me, I can take them to the right place as evidence; otherwise people will think we’ve stolen it.”\n\nThe others assured her, “None of us broke it. Maybe one of the maids attending the young ladies did. Why not think carefully or ask them?”\n\nThis reminded the woman, who said with a smile, “Yes, I remember now. Cuilu was holding it. I must ask her.”\n\nShe went off and had just reached the corridor when she met Zijuan and Cuilu.\n\n“Has the party ended?” asked Cuilu. “Where’s our young lady now?”\n\n“Where’s that teacup? You’re asking me for our young lady!” cried Tsui Lu.\n\n“I went to pour some tea for her,” was Green Lace’s reply. “But when I turned round she’d gone.”\n\n“Her Ladyship said they’ve all gone to bed,” the woman told her. “You’ve no idea where you’ve been amusing yourself, that’s what.”\n\n“She can’t have gone to bed without a word,” protested Green Lace. “Most likely she’s strolled off somewhere. Now that the old lady’s left, she may have gone to see her home. Let’s go and look for her there. Once we find Miss Lin, we’ll find your teacup. You can look for it first thing tomorrow — there’s no hurry.”\n\nThe woman laughed.\n\n“As long as it’s not lost, there’s no hurry. I’ll ask you for it tomorrow.” She went off then to check the other things.\n\nBut let us return to Tai-yu and Hsiang-yun, who had not gone to bed. Seeing so many people in the Chia mansion enjoying the moonlight, and hearing the Lady Dowager complain that it was a pity they were so few, Tai-yu had thought of Pao-chai and the other cousins who had gone home to enjoy the festival with their own families. This had so depressed her that, leaning on the balustrade shedding tears, she was comforted by Hsiang-yun.\n\n“You’re an understanding person, cousin. Why don’t you look after your health? It’s too bad of Pao-chai and Pao-chin to abandon us like this, just when they’d been carrying on so affectionately and talking only the other day about getting all of us together to enjoy the mid-autumn moon, and to start a poetry club to write couplets. Now they’ve dropped us and gone to enjoy the moon by themselves, so the club’s disbanded before it’s even started, and we shan’t be writing any poems. They’re having a high old time with their fathers and brothers. As the first emperor of Sung put it so well, ‘How can I let other people sleep alongside my bed?’ Since they’ve left us in the lurch, let’s two write some linked verses to shame them tomorrow!”\n\nNot wanting to dampen her high spirits, Tai-yu replied with a smile, “All this noise here would spoil any poetic inspiration.”\n\n“You know, the view of the moon from this hill is good, but it can’t compare with the view from the waterside. At the foot of this slope is the pool, and in the hollow near the water is Concave Crystal Lodge. The planning of this garden shows real scholarship. The highest point of the hill is called Convex Emerald Hall, and the low-lying place by the water Concave Crystal Lodge. The terms ‘convex’ and ‘concave’ are so little used that they sound fresh and original as names for these halls. Obviously, one high and one low, one in a prominent position and one hidden, one on the hill and one by the water, were designed specially for enjoying the moon. Those who like the moon small and high can come up here; those who like it reflected in clear water can go down there. But as few people use these two words, pronouncing them ‘wa’ and ‘gong,’ they’re considered vulgar. Lu Fangweng, you remember, used the word ‘concave’ in his line: ‘In ancient ink-stone’s slight concavity much ink is gathered.’ Yet some critics consider that vulgar too. Isn’t that ridiculous?”\n\n“Not only Lu Fangweng,” rejoined Tai-yu. “Many other ancients used these words too. For instance, in Green Mosses, in Tungfang Shuo’s Classic of Gods and Marvels, and in the Record of Paintings we find the story of Chang Seng-yu’s painting of the I-Cheng Monastery — there are too many instances to cite. It’s just that modern people don’t know this and mistakenly consider the words vulgar. Well, to tell you the truth, these two names were thought up by me that year when we were testing Pao-yu. His suggestions weren’t good, so I made some up and we showed them to the Imperial Consort. She took them to show the Emperor, and that’s how they came to be adopted. Let’s go now to Concave Crystal Lodge.”\n\nSo, chatting, the two girls descended the slope.\n\nJust round this bend. A bamboo railing ran along the edge of the pool all the way to the path leading to Alpinia Park. Only two old women were on night duty there, but knowing that the family was enjoying the moonlight on Convex Emerald Hall and they were not needed, they had put out their light and gone to bed.\n\nDaiyu and Xiangyun, seeing their light was out, chuckled, “Well, they’ve gone to bed. Why don’t we enjoy the moon from this pavilion here over the water?”\n\nThey sat down on two bamboo stools. Overhead was a bright moon and in the pool its reflection, vying in radiance so that they seemed to be in a palace of crystal. A faint breeze rippled the emerald water, wrinkling it into shimmering folds, and they felt pleasantly refreshed.\n\n“How nice it would be to drink in a boat now,” remarked Xiangyun. “If I were at home, I’d take a boat at once.”\n\n“That’s what is known as ‘If you seek perfection, you’ll never be happy,’” rejoined Daiyu. “I don’t see that it’s necessary to take a boat.”\n\nXiangyun smiled. “The more you get, the more you want. That’s only human.”\n\nAs they were chatting, the sound of a flute was wafted to them.\n\n“The old lady’s in high spirits today, so this flute-playing is very pleasing,” said Daiyu. “It adds to our fun. As we both like poetry in five-character lines, suppose we compose an ode in regulated verse?”\n\n“Which rhyme shall we use?” asked Xiangyun.\n\nDaiyu proposed with a smile, “Let’s count the upright rails in this railing, from this end to that, and whichever number we stop at will be our rhyme.”\n\n“That’s a novel idea.”\n\nThey rose to their feet and counted from the beginning to the end. There were just thirteen rails.\n\n“So it’s the thirteenth rhyme again,” cried Xiangyun. “This is one of the less common rhymes. You may find it hard to make all the lines rhyme in a long poem. You’d better start it.”\n\nDaiyu smiled. “We’ll see which of us does better. But we’ve no paper or brush to write it down.”\n\n“We can write it out tomorrow. I’m sure we’ll remember it.”\n\n“All right, I’ll start with a ready-made commonplace line.” She recited:\n\n“On mid-autumn night thrice five,”\n\nXiangyun thought for a second.\n\n“As on fifteenth night fine.\nThe sky with stars doth shine,”\n\nDaiyu continued:\n\n“And sweet music is heard everywhere.\nIn how many houses do revellers flare?”\n\n“That line ‘In how many houses do revellers flare?’ is good,” approved Xiangyun. “My next line must match it.” After a little thought she said:\n\n“What family does not gaze at the moon fair?\nThe cool breeze sighing.”\n\n“That’s a good matching line, better than mine,” said Daiyu. “But you’ve lapsed into colloquialism again. You should make more effort.”\n\n“The more rhymes, the more difficulties,” Xiangyun replied. “We have to be discursive. If we have any good lines, we should keep them for the end.”\n\n“If by the end you’ve no good lines, you’ll feel like a fool.” Daiyu went on:\n\n“The lovely night is clamorous.\nOld folk are mocked for snatching cake.”\n\n“That’s no good, you’re inventing,” protested Xiangyun. “Using a homely incident to make things difficult for me.”\n\n“You show your ignorance,” retorted Daiyu. “The expression ‘eating cake’ is an old典故 allu-sion. Look it up in the Tang History and Tang Records before you argue.”\n\n“Well, that doesn’t floor me. I’ve got an answer.” Xiangyun continued:\n\n“Young girls for melon-scooping are laughed at.\nThe cassia blooms smell sweet;”\n\n“Now you’re inventing,” teased Daiyu.\n\n“We can look it up tomorrow to show everyone. But now let’s not waste time.”\n\n“All the same, your next line is no good either. There’s no need to pad it out with phrases like ‘cassia’ or ‘golden orchids.’” Daiyu continued:\n\n“The golden lily leaves grow wild.\nCandle-light shines on the feast;”\n\nXiangyun chuckled, “You’re let off lightly with ‘golden lily.’ That saves you a lot of trouble. You’ve got such a handy rhyme.”\n\n“I’m not against praising Their Majesties, but not on their account. Besides, your next line was a makeshift one too.”\n\n“If you hadn’t said ‘jade cassia,’” retorted Daiyu, “do you think I’d have forced this ‘golden daylilies’ on you? We have to have some grand phrases too to describe the actual scene.”\n\nXiangyun had to go on:\n\n“The cups and dice in the garden run riot.\nThe guests divide into groups, each with a leader...”\n\n“A good line, though hard to match,” approved Daiyu. After a little thought she continued:\n\n“Three times the game of forfeits is announced.\nDice like red spots are thrown...”\n\n“Interesting, ‘three times announced’!” cried Xiangyun. “You’ve made a common expression poetic. But your next line brings in money again.” She had to cap it:\n\n“While the drum for Pass-the-Flower madly sounds.\nThe clear moonbeams on courtyard and house shimmer...”\n\n“Not a bad couplet,” said Daiyu. “But you’ve slipped up again, padding with wind and moonlight.”\n\n“We haven’t yet brought in the moon, we must make some allusion to it or we’ll be off the subject.”\n\n“All right, let’s keep it and make corrections tomorrow.” Daiyu went on:\n\n“Its white light merges with the sky.\nNo distinction is made in forfeits between host and guests...”\n\n“Why turn to them again?” objected Xiangyun. “Why not keep to ourselves?”\n\nShe continued:\n\n“In composing poems we vie.\nLeaning on the balustrade we meditate...”\n\n“Now that’s more like us,” said Daiyu, and capped:\n\n“Or pace the door to find a line.\nThe wine is finished, but still the fun lasts...”\n\n“It’s late now!” Xiangyun exclaimed, and added:\n\n“The night is far spent, the merry-making ends.\nGradually the talking and laughter die away...”\n\n“Yes, each line from now on should be harder to find,” agreed Daiyu, and continued:\n\n“Till nothing remains but moonlight and frost.\nOn the steps, dewdrops glisten on fungus...”\n\n“How can I find a rhyme for that?” Xiangyun wondered. She rose and clasping her hands behind her back thought hard. “Well, I’ve got it, luckily, or I’d have had to drop out.” Then she declaimed:\n\n“In the courtyard, mist shrouds the night-closing flowers.\nA swift stream lashes the rocks...”\n\nDaiyu, impressed, stood up and cried, “You devil! So you were keeping the best lines for the end. This character hūn for ‘night-closing’ is a real find.”\n\n“I saw it yesterday in an anthology of essays through the ages, but couldn’t guess what tree it was and wanted to look it up. Cousin Baochai told me, ‘No need to, it’s what’s commonly called “that which opens at dawn and closes at night.”’ I didn’t believe her and looked it up, and it was right. She seems to know everything.”\n\n“This character hūn is very apt here,” conceded Daiyu. “But as for your line about a swift stream, that’s really ingenious. It puts all the rest in the shade. I shall have to take great pains with the next line, though I can’t hope to match it.” After some reflection she said:\n\n“From the clouds’ roots wind-driven snow swirls.\nThe star Altair is pure and bright...”\n\n“Not a bad couplet,” said Xiangyun. “Still, you’ve slipped up again by bringing in a star to pad with — though at least it’s in keeping with the scene.” She went on:\n\n“The Silver River exhales its breath.\nThe elixir is pounded by the Jade Hare...”\n\nDaiyu nodded in silence and after a while said:\n\n“To the Cold Palace flies the goddess.\nThey would challenge the Herdboy...”\n\nXiangyun, gazing at the moon, nodded too and continued:\n\n“Or visit the Weaving Maid by raft.\nThe full and the waning none can fix...”\n\n“A poor antithesis, too much the same,” commented Daiyu. “You should make the next line open up a new vista, applying the method of ‘treating a critical disease with slow-acting drugs.’” She continued:\n\n“The dark and bright sides are both empty.\nThe clepsydra will soon run dry...”\n\nAs Xiangyun was wondering how to follow this, Daiyu pointed out a dark shadow in the pool.\n\n“Look at that black shape in the river,” she said. “It looks like a person. Is it a ghost?”\n\n“Yes, I see it too,” cried Xiangyun. “I’m not afraid of ghosts. I’ll hit it with a stone.”\n\n\"I'll hit him.\" She bent down, picked up a small stone and threw it into the pool. There was a splash, and the moon's reflection rippled out in a big circle, scattering and re-forming several times. Then from the dark shadow came a squawk as a white stork flew up towards Lotus Fragrance Anchorage.\n\n\"It was only that stork,\" said Daiyu. \"It gave me quite a fright, coming so unexpectedly.\"\n\nXiangyun laughed. \"It's a delightful stork, and it's just helped me.\" She continued:\n\nThe lamp by the window flickers, spent.\nOver the cold pool a stork's shadow flies...\n\nDaiyu, impressed but disconcerted, exclaimed, \"This is really fantastic! That stork did help her. This line is even better than 'autumn torrents.' What can I write to match it? 'Shadow' only rhymes with 'soul.' Besides, 'over the cold pool a stork's shadow flies' is so natural, apt and picturesque, and so original too, it makes me want to throw down my brush.\"\n\nXiangyun said, \"Let's think carefully. If we can't find the next line, we can always leave this couplet till tomorrow.\"\n\nDaiyu ignored her, looking up at the sky. After a while she suddenly smiled.\n\n\"Don't crow! I have it. Listen.\" She declaimed:\n\nThe cold moon buries the flower's soul.\n\nXiangyun clapped her hands and cried, \"Excellent! That's the only possible line. 'Buries the flower's soul' is superb.\" She added with a sigh, \"The verse is certainly original, only it sounds rather too decadent. You shouldn't write such ominous, fantastic lines while you're still ill.\"\n\nDaiyu retorted, \"If I didn't, how could I surpass you? I had to put all my inspiration into that one line.\"\n\nBefore the words were out of her mouth, they saw someone emerge from behind the rocks by the balustrade and laugh.\n\n\"That's a fine poem, very fine,\" she said. \"Only it's too melancholy. You'd better not go on. If what follows is in the same vein, it will spoil the effect of these two lines and make the whole seem forced.\"\n\nStartled, the two girls looked hard at the speaker and were surprised to see it was Miaoyu.\n\n\"How did you get here?\" they asked.\n\n\"I've been listening to you enjoying the moonlight and the fine flute-playing, so I came out to enjoy the clear pool and bright moon too,\" she told them. \"As I strolled over I heard you two composing verses. It sounded so refined, I was quite entranced. But some lines in the poem you've just composed, though good, are too decadent and dismal. This has to do with one's fate, which is why I came out to stop you. The old lady has dismissed the party long ago, and everyone in the Garden must be asleep by now. Your maids will be wondering where you are -- aren't you afraid of catching cold? Come back with me quickly to my place for some tea. It will soon be dawn.\"\n\nDaiyu said with a smile, \"I'd no idea it was so late.\"\n\nThe three of them went to Green Lattice Nunnery. They saw that the lamp before the shrine was still alight and the incense in the burner not quite burnt out. The old nuns were asleep and a young novice was dozing on a hassock. Miaoyu roused her to make tea. Then they heard knocking at the gate and the young novice went to open it. It was Zijuan and Cuilu with some old nurses, who had come to look for their young mistresses.\n\nFinding them drinking tea, the newcomers exclaimed, \"We've been hunting high and low for you. We've searched the whole Garden, even gone to Lady Wang's quarters. The watchmen in the little pavilion had just woken up, and we asked them. They said, 'Just now we heard two people talking under the shed outside the pavilion, then a third joined in. They said they were going to the nunnery.' So we knew we'd find you here.\"\n\nMiaoyu told her novice to take them to the side room to rest and have some tea. She herself, taking brush, ink-slab and paper, asked the two girls to repeat their verses and wrote them all down from the beginning. Daiyu, seeing how unusually friendly she was...\n\nBaoyu was so delighted that he remarked with a smile, “I’ve never seen you in such high spirits. I didn’t venture to ask for your instruction, but may I do so now? If this is too poor, just burn it; but if it can be improved, please correct it for me.”\n\n“I wouldn’t presume to pass judgment,” she replied. “But this has only twenty-two rhymes. It seems to me that you two have already produced such fine lines, if you go on you may not be able to keep up the same standard. If I try to add a dog’s tail to your sable, I may spoil it.”\n\nDaiyu, who had never seen Miaoyu write poetry before, was so impressed by her enthusiasm that she urged her, “Do have a try. Even if it’s not up to our standard, it won’t matter.”\n\n“We must wind up now by harking back to our start,” said Miaoyu. “If we abandon truth and just go in for the fantastic, not only shall we lose the feminine touch but the poem will lack unity.”\n\nDaiyu and Xiangyun agreed and urged her to start. After a little reflection Miaoyu picked up her brush and wrote straight off. Then she handed them the paper, saying, “Don’t laugh at me. This is the only way, in my opinion, to reverse the previous trend. Although there are some distressing lines ahead, that doesn’t matter.”\n\nThey took the paper and read:\n\nThe incense in the gold tripod melts away,\n\nGrease from the jade basin has congealed.\n\nThe flute’s notes grieve like a widow’s sobs;\n\nThe bed-mat’s cold, a maid must bring warm quilts.\n\nThe phoenix design on the tent hangs slack;\n\nThe painted drake on the screen seems desolate.\n\nThick dew has made the moss more slippery;\n\nHeavy frost on bamboos can’t be brushed away.\n\nBy the winding pool we take a stroll,\n\nThen climb the silent, lonely hill.\n\nStrange rocks look like crouching beasts;\n\nGrotesque trees are like sleeping tigers.\n\nIn the glow of dawn the palace fountains spurt;\n\nMorning mist veils the turrets and the towers.\n\nA thousand birds in the woods are roused;\n\nOne ape in the valley cries.\n\nFamiliar with the cross-roads, we forget the path;\n\nKnowing the source, we need not ask about the stream.\n\nFrom Green Lattice Temple boom the bells;\n\nAt Paddy-Sweet Cottage cocks crow.\n\nWhy should our inspiration lead to grief?\n\nWhy should free thoughts give way to sorrow?\n\nLet each her own emotions express,\n\nAnd to none other her fancies confess.\n\nLet us not say that we have sat up too late,\n\nBut brew some fresh tea and talk more yet.\n\nBelow was written: “Thirty-five rhymes on the Mid-Autumn Festival in Grand View Garden.”\n\nDaiyu and Xiangyun praised this poem enthusiastically.\n\n“We’ve been carrying a torch all this time for no reason,” they said. “To think that all these days we’ve had such a fine poetess here, yet were too blind to see it and tried to show off our own poor skill!”\n\nMiaoyu laughed.\n\n“I can polish it tomorrow. But it’s dawn now and high time to rest.”\n\nAt that, the other two rose to take their leave and went out with their maids. Miaoyu saw them to the gate, then closed it after they had gone.\n\nNow Cuilu remarked to Xiangyun, “Madam Zhu must have people waiting for us to go to bed. Where had we better go now?”\n\n“We can send to tell them on our way to turn in,” said Xiangyun. “If I go back, I may wake the patient up. I’d better go and disturb Cousin Lin.”\n\nSo they went to Bamboo Lodge. Half the inmates there were asleep. The two girls went in and, after washing, undressed and went to bed. Zijuan put down the bed-curtain and moved the lamp outside, then closed the door on them.\n\nNow Xiangyun suffered from insomnia in a strange bed, and try as she would she could not sleep. Daiyu too was a light sleeper, and now that she had missed her usual hour she could not doze off either. So they tossed to and fro in their beds.\n\n“Are you still awake?” asked Daiyu.\n\nXiangyun chuckled. “I’ve this wretched habit of being wakeful in a strange bed. I’ll just have to lie here. What’s keeping you awake?”\n\n“I’ve been like this for some time,” sighed Daiyu. “I don’t think I get ten good nights’ sleep in a year.”\n\n“No wonder you’re so poorly.”\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
