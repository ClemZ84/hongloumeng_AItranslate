  "original": "话说莺儿见宝玉说话，摸不着头脑，正自要走，只听宝玉又说道：“傻丫头，我告诉你罢。你姑娘既是有造化的，你跟着他，自然也是有造化的了。你袭人姐姐是靠不住的。只要往后你尽心伏侍他就是了，日后或有好处，也不枉你跟着他熬了一场。”莺儿听着前头象话，后头说的又有些不象了，便道：“我知道了。姑娘还等我呢。二爷要吃果子时，打发小丫头叫我就是了。”宝玉点头，莺儿才去了。一时，宝钗、袭人回来，各自房中去了，不提。\n　　且说过了几天，便是场期。别人只知盼望他爷儿两个作了好文章，便可以高中的了，只有宝钗见宝玉的工课虽好，只是那有意无意之间，却别有一种冷静的光景。知他要进场了，头一件，叔侄两个都是初次赴考，恐人马拥挤，有什么失闪；第二件，宝玉自和尚去后，总不出门，虽然见他用功喜欢，只是改的太速太好了，反倒有些信不及，只怕又有什么变故。所以进场的头一天，一面派了袭人带了小丫头们同着素云等给他爷儿两个收拾妥当，自己又都过了目，好好的搁起，预备着，一面过来同李纨回了王夫人，拣家里老成的管事的多派了几个，只说怕人马拥挤碰了。\n　　次日，宝玉、贾兰换了半新不旧的衣服、欣然过来见了王夫人。王夫人嘱咐道：“你们爷儿两个都是初次下场，但是你们活了这么大，并不曾离开我一天。就是不在我跟前，也是丫头媳妇们围着，何曾自己孤身睡过一夜？今日各自进去，孤孤凄凄，举目无亲，须要自己保重。早些作完了文章出来，找着家人，早些回来，也叫你母亲、媳妇们放心。”王夫人说着，不免伤起心来。贾兰听一句答应一句。只见宝玉一声不哼，待王夫人说完了，走过来给王夫人跪下，满眼流泪，磕了三个头，说道：“母亲生我一世，我也无可答报。只有这一入场，用心作了文章，好好的中个举人出来，那时太太喜欢喜欢，便是儿子一辈子的事也完了，一辈子的不好也都遮过去了。”王夫人听了，更觉伤心，便道：“你有这个心，自然是好的，可惜你老太太不能见你的面了！”一面说，一面哭着拉他。那宝玉只管跪着，不肯起来，便说道：“老太太见与不见，总是知道的，喜欢的。既能知道了喜欢了，便是不见也和见了的一样。只不过隔了形质，并非隔了神气啊。”\n　　李纨见王夫人和他如此，一则怕勾起宝玉的病来，二则也觉得光景不大吉祥，连忙过来说道：“太太，这是大喜的事，为什么这样伤心？况且宝兄弟近来很知好歹，很孝顺，又肯用功。只要带了侄儿进去，好好的作文章，早早的回来，写出来请咱们的世交老先生们看了，等着爷儿两个都报了喜，就完了。”一面叫人搀起宝玉来。宝玉却转过身来给李纨作了个揖，说：“嫂子放心，我们爷儿两个都是必中的。日后兰哥还有大出息，大嫂子还要带凤冠穿霞帔呢。”李纨笑道：“但愿应了叔叔的话，也不枉……”说到这里，恐怕又惹起王夫人的伤心来，连忙咽住了。宝玉笑道：“只要有了个好儿子，能够接续祖基，就是大哥哥不能见，也算他的后事完了。”李纨见天气不早了，也不肯尽着和他说话，只好点点头儿。\n　　此时宝钗听得，早已呆了。这些话不但宝玉说的不好，便是王夫人李纨所说，句句都是不祥之兆，却又不敢认真，只得忍泪无言。那宝玉走到跟前，深深的作了一个揖。众人见他行事古怪，也摸不着是怎么样，又不敢笑他。只见宝钗的眼泪直流下来，众人更是纳罕。又听宝玉说道：“姐姐，我要走了。你好生跟着太太，听我的喜信儿罢！”宝钗道：“是时候了，你不必说这些唠叨话了。”宝玉道：“你倒催的我紧，我自己也知道该走了！”回头见众人都在这里，只没惜春、紫鹃，便说道：“四妹妹和紫鹃姐姐跟前，替我说罢。他们两个横竖是再见的。”\n　　众人见他的话，又象有理，又象疯话。大家只说他从来没出过门，都是太太的一套话招出来的，不如早早催他去了就完了事了，便说道：“外面有人等你呢，你再闹就误了时辰了。”宝玉仰面大笑道：“走了，走了！不用胡闹了，完了事了！”众人也都笑道：“快走罢！”独有王夫人和宝钗娘儿两个倒象生离死别的一般，那眼泪也不知从那里来的，直流下来，几乎失声哭出。但见宝玉嘻天哈地，大有疯傻之状，遂从此出门而去。正是：\n　　走来名利无双地，打出樊笼第一关。\n　　不言宝玉、贾兰出门赴考，且说贾环见他们考去，自己又气又恨，便自大为王，说：“我可要给母亲报仇了。家里一个男人没有，上头大太太依了我，还怕谁！”想定了主意，跑到邢夫人那边请了安，说了些奉承的话。那邢夫人自然喜欢，便说道：“你这才是明理的孩子呢。象那巧姐儿的事，原该我作主的。你琏二哥糊涂，放着亲奶奶倒托别人去。”贾环道：“人家那头儿也说了：只认得这一门子，现在定了，还要备一分大礼来送太太呢。如今太太有了这样的藩王孙女女婿，还怕大老爷没大官做么？不是我说自己的太太，他们有了元妃姐姐，便欺压的人难受！将来巧姐别也是这样没良心，等我去问问他。”邢夫人道：“你也该告诉他，他才知道你的好处。只怕他父亲在家也找不出这么门子好亲事来。但只平儿那个糊涂东西，他倒说这件事不好，说是你太太也不愿意。想来恐怕我们得了意。若迟了，你二哥回来，又听人家的话，就办不成了。”贾环道：“那边都定了，只等太太出了八字。王府的规矩，三天就要来娶的。但是一件，只怕太太不愿意，那边说是不该娶犯官的孙女，只好悄悄的抬了去，等大老爷免了罪，做了官，再大家热闹起来。”邢夫人道：“这有什么不愿意？也是礼上应该的。”贾环道：“既这么着，这帖子太太出了就是了。”邢夫人道：“这孩子又糊涂了！里头都是女人，你叫蔷哥儿写了一个就是了。”贾环听说，喜欢的了不得，连忙答应了出来。赶着和贾芸说了，邀着王仁到那外藩公馆立文书、兑银子去了。\n　　那知刚才所说的话早被跟邢夫人的丫头听见。那丫头是求了平儿才挑上的，便抽空儿赶到平儿那里，一五一十的都告诉了。平儿早知此事不好，已和巧姐细细的说明。巧姐哭了一夜，必要等他父亲回来作主，大太太的话不能遵；今儿又听见这话，便大哭起来，要和太太讲去。平儿急忙拦住道：“姑娘且慢着。大太太是你的亲祖母，他说二爷不在家，大太太做得主的，况且还有舅舅做保山。他们都是一气，姑娘一个人，那里说得过呢？我到底是下人，说不上话去。如今只可想法儿，断不可冒失的。”邢夫人那边的丫头道：“你们快快的想主意，不然可就要抬走了！”说着各自去了。\n　　平儿回过头来，见巧姐哭作一团，连忙扶着道：“姑娘，哭是不中用的。如今是二爷彀不着。听见他们的话头……”这句话还没说完，只见邢夫人那边打发人来告诉：“姑娘大喜的事来了，叫平儿将姑娘所有应用的东西料理出来。若是赔送呢，原说明了等二爷回来再办。”平儿只得答应了回来。又见王夫人过来。巧姐儿一把抱住，哭得倒在怀里。王夫人也哭道：“妞儿不用着急。我为你吃了大太太好些话，看来是扭不过来的。我们只好应着缓下去，即刻差个家人赶到你父亲那里去告诉。”平儿道：“太太还不知道么，早起三爷在大太太跟前说了，什么外藩规矩，三日就要过去的。如今大太太已叫芸哥儿写了名字年庚去了，还等待二爷么？”王夫人听说是三爷，便气得话也说不出来，呆了半天，一叠声叫找贾环。找了半天，人回：“今早同蔷哥儿、王舅爷出去了。”王夫人问：“芸哥呢？”众人回说：“不知道。”巧姐屋内人人瞪眼，都无方法。王夫人也难和邢夫人争论，只有大家抱头大哭。\n　　正闹着，一个婆子进来回说：“后门上的人说，那个刘老老又来了。”王夫人道：“咱们家遭了这样事，那有工夫接待人，不拘怎么回了他去罢。”平儿道：“太太该叫他进来，他是姐儿的干妈，也得告诉告诉他。”王夫人不言语。那婆子便带了刘老老进来。各人见了问好。刘老老见众人的眼圈儿通红，也摸不着头脑，迟了一会子，问道：“怎么了？太太姑娘们必是想二姑奶奶了。”巧姐儿听见提起他母亲，越发大哭起来。平儿道：“老老别说闲话。你既是姑娘的干妈，也该知道的。”便一五一十的告诉了。把个刘老老也唬怔了，等了半天，忽然笑道：“你这样一个伶俐姑娘，没听见过鼓儿词么？这上头的法儿多着呢，这有什么难的？”平儿赶忙问道：“老老，你有什么法儿快说罢！”刘老老道：“这有什么难的呢，一个人也不叫他们知道，扔崩一走就完了事了。”平儿道：“这可是混说了。我们这样人家的人，走到那里去？”刘老老道：“只怕你们不走，你们要走，就到我屯里去。我就把姑娘藏起来，即刻叫我女婿弄了人，叫姑娘亲笔写个字儿，赶到姑老爷那里，少不得他就来了，可不好么？”平儿道：“大太太知道呢？”刘老老道：“我来他们知道么？”平儿道：“大太太住在前头，他待人刻薄，有什么信，没人送给他的。你若前门走来，就知道了；如今是后门来的，不妨事。”刘老老道：“咱们说定了几时，我叫女婿打了车来接了去。”平儿道：“这还等得几时吗？你坐着罢。”急忙进去，将刘老老的话，避了旁人告诉了。\n　　王夫人想了半天不妥当。平儿道：“只好这样。为的是太太，才敢说明。太太就装不知道，回来倒问大太太。我们那里就有人去，想二爷回来也快。”王夫人不言语，叹了一口气。巧姐儿听见，便和王夫人道：“求太太救我！横竖父亲回来只有感激的。”平儿道：“不用说了，太太回去罢。只要太太派人看屋子。”王夫人道：“掩密些！你们两个人的衣服铺盖是要的啊。”平儿道：“要快走才中用呢！若是他们定了回来，就有饥荒了。”一句话提醒了王夫人，便道：“是了，你们快办去罢，有我呢。”\n　　于是王夫人回去，倒过去找邢夫人说闲话儿，把邢夫人先绊住了。平儿这里便遣人料理去了，嘱咐道：“倒别避人。有人进来看见，就说是大太太吩咐的，要一辆车子送刘老老去。”这里又买嘱了看后门的人雇了车来。平儿便将巧姐装做青儿模样，急急的去了。后来平儿只当送人，眼错不见，也跨上车去了。原来近日贾府后门虽开，只有一两个人看着，余外虽有几个家下人，因房大人少，空落落的，谁能照应？且邢夫人又是个不怜下人的。家人明知此事不好，又都感念平儿的好处，所以通同一气，放走了巧姐。邢夫人还自和王夫人说话，那里理会。只有王夫人甚不放心，说了一回话，悄悄的走到宝钗那里坐下，心里还是惦记着。宝钗见王夫人神色恍惚，便问：“太太的心里有什么事？”王夫人将这事背地里和宝钗说了。宝钗道：“险得很！如今得快快儿的叫芸哥儿止住那里才妥当。”王夫人道：“我找不着环儿呢。”宝钗道：“太太总要装作不知，等我想个人去叫大太太知道才好。“王夫人点头，一任宝钗想人，暂且不言。\n　　且说外藩原是要买几个使唤的女人，据媒人一面之辞，所以派人相看。相看的人回去，禀明了藩王，藩王问起人家，众人不敢隐瞒，只得实说。那外藩听了，知是世代勋戚，便说：“了不得，这是有干例禁的，几乎误了大事！况我朝觐已过，便要择日起程。倘有人来再说，快快打发出去！”这日恰好贾芸、王仁等递送年庚，只见府门里头的人便说：“奉王爷的命说，敢拿贾府的人来冒充民女者，要拿住究治的！如今太平时候，谁敢这样大胆？”这一嚷，唬得王仁等抱头鼠窜的出来，埋怨那说事的人，大家扫兴而散。\n　　贾环在家候信，又闻王夫人传唤，急得烦躁起来，见贾芸一人回来，赶着问道：“定了么？”贾芸慌忙跺足道：“了不得，了不得，不知谁露了风了。”还把吃亏的话说了一遍。贾环气得发怔，说：“我早起在大太太跟前说的这样好，如今怎么样处呢？这都是你们众人坑了我了！”\n　　正没主意，听见里头乱嚷，叫着贾环等的名字，说：“大太太、二太太叫呢！”两个人只得蹭进去。只见王夫人怒容满面，说：“你们干的好事！如今逼死了巧姐和平儿了。快快的给我找还尸首来完事！”两个人跪下。贾环不敢言语。贾芸低头说道：“孙子不敢干什么。为的是邢舅太爷和王舅爷说给巧妹妹作媒，我们才回太太们的。大太太愿意，才叫孙子写帖儿去的。人家还不要呢，怎么我们逼死了妹妹呢？”王夫人道：“环儿在大太太那里说的，三日内便要抬了走。说亲作媒，有这样的么？我也不问，你们快把巧姐儿还了我们，等老爷回来再说！”邢夫人如今也是一句话儿说不出了，只有落泪。王夫人便骂贾环说，“赵姨娘这样混账东西，留的种子也是这混账的！”说着，叫丫头扶了，回到自己房中。\n　　那贾环、贾芸、邢夫人三个人互相埋怨，说道：“如今且不用埋怨。想来死是不死的，必是平儿带了他到那什么亲戚家躲着去了。”邢夫人叫了前后的门上人来骂着，问：“巧姐儿和平儿，知道那里去了？”岂知下人一口同音，说是：“大太太不必问我们，问当家的爷们就知道了。在大太太也不用闹，等我们太太问起来，我们有话说。要打大家打，要发大家都发。自从琏二爷出了门，外头闹的还得了！我们的月钱月米是不给了，赌钱喝酒，闹小旦，还接了外头的媳妇儿到宅里来，这不是爷吗？”说得贾芸等顿口无言。王夫人那边又打发人来催说：“叫爷们快找来！”那贾环等急得恨无地缝可钻，又不敢盘问巧姐那边的人。明知众人深恨，是必藏起来了，但是这句话怎敢在王夫人面前说，只得各处亲戚家打听，毫无踪迹。里头一个邢夫人，外头环儿等，这几天闹的昼夜不宁。\n　　看看到了出场日期，王夫人只盼着宝玉、贾兰回来。等到晌午，不见回来，王夫人、李纨、宝钗着忙，打发人去到下处打听。去了一起，又无消息，连去的人也不来了。回来又打发一起人去，又不见回来。三个人心里如热油熬煎。\n　　等到傍晚，有人进来，见是贾兰。众人喜欢，问道：“宝二叔呢？”贾兰也不及请安，便哭道：“二叔丢了！”王夫人听了这话，便怔了半天，也不言语，便直挺挺的躺倒床上，亏得彩云等在后扶着，下死的叫醒转来。哭着，见宝钗也是白瞪两眼，袭人等已哭得泪人一般。只有哭着骂贾兰道：“糊涂东西！你同二叔在一处，怎么他就丢了？”贾兰道：“我和二叔在下处是一处吃，一处睡，进了场相离也不远，刻刻在一处的。今儿一早，二叔的卷子早完了，还等我呢。我们两个人一起去交了卷子，一同出来，在龙门口一挤，回头就不见了。我们家接场的人都问我。李贵还说：‘看见的，相离不过数步，怎么一挤就不见了？’现叫李贵等分头的找去。我也带了人，各处号里都找遍了，没有，我所以这时候才回来。”\n　　王夫人是哭的一句话也说不出来，宝钗心里已知八九，袭人痛哭不已，贾蔷等不等吩咐，也是分头而去。可怜荣府的人，个个死多活少，空备了接场的酒饭。贾兰也都忘了辛苦，还要自己找去。倒是王夫人拦住道：“我的儿，你叔叔丢了，还禁得再丢了你么？好孩子你歇歇去罢。”贾兰那里肯走，尤氏等苦劝不止。众人中只有惜春心里却明白了，只不好说出来，便问宝钗道：“二哥哥带了玉去了没有？”宝钗道：“这是随身的东西，怎么不带？”惜春听了，便不言语。袭人想起那日抢玉的事来，也是料着那和尚作怪，柔肠几断，珠泪交流，呜呜咽咽哭个不住，追想当年宝玉相待的情分：“有时怄他，他便恼了，也有一种令人回心的好处，那温存体贴，是不用说了。若怄急了他，便赌誓说做和尚。谁知今日却应了这句话了！”\n　　不言袭人苦想，却说那天已是四更，并没个信儿。李纨怕王夫人苦坏了，极力劝着回房。众人都跟着伺候，只有邢夫人回去。贾环躲着不敢出来。王夫人叫贾兰去了，一夜无眠。次日天明，虽有家人回来，都说：“没有一处不寻到，实在没有影儿。”于是薛姨妈、薛蝌、史湘云、宝琴、李婶娘等接二连三的过来请安问信。\n　　如此一连数日，王夫人哭得饮食不进，命在垂危。忽有家人回道：“海疆来了一人，口称统制大人那里来的，说我们家的三姑奶奶明日到京了。”王夫人听说探春回京，虽不能解宝玉之愁，那个心略放了些。到了明日，果然探春回来。众人远远接着，见探春出挑得比先前更好了，服采鲜明。看见王夫人形容枯槁，众人眼肿腮红，便也大哭起来，哭了一会，然后行礼。看见惜春道姑打扮，心里很不舒服。又听见宝玉心迷走失，家中多少不顺的事，大家又哭起来。还亏得探春能言，见解亦高，把话来慢慢儿的劝解了好些时，王夫人等略觉好些。至次日，三姑爷也来了，知有这样事，留探春住下劝解。跟探春的丫头老婆也与众姐妹们相聚，各诉别后情事。从此，上上下下的人，竟是无昼无夜，专等宝玉的信。\n　　那一夜五更多天，外头几个家人进来，到二门口报喜。几个小丫头乱跑进来，也不及告诉大丫头了，进了屋子，便说：“太太奶奶们大喜！”王夫人打量宝玉找着了，便喜欢的站起身来说：“在那里找着的？快叫他进来！”那人道：“中了第七名举人。”王夫人道：“宝玉呢？”家人不言语。王夫人仍旧坐下。探春便问：“第七名中的是谁？”家人回说：“是宝二爷。”正说着，外头又嚷：“兰哥儿中了！”那家人赶忙出去，接了报单回禀，见贾兰中了一百三十名。李纨心下自然喜欢，但因不见了宝玉，不敢喜形于色。王夫人见贾兰中了，心下也是喜欢，只想：“若是宝玉一回来，咱们这些人，不知怎样乐呢。”独有宝钗心下悲苦，又不好掉泪。众人道喜，说是：“宝玉既有中的命，自然再不会丢的，不过再过两天，必然找的着。”王夫人等想来不错，略有笑容，众人便趁势劝王夫人等多进了些饮食。只见三门外头焙茗乱嚷说：“我们二爷中了举人，是丢不了的了。”众人问道：“怎么见得？”焙茗道：“‘一举成名天下闻’，如今二爷走到那里，那里就知道的，谁敢不送来！”里头的众人都说：“这小子虽是没规矩，这句话是不错的。”惜春道：“这样大人了，那里有走失的？只怕他勘破世情，入了空门，这就难找着他了。”这句话又招的王夫人等都大哭起来。李纨道：“古来成佛作祖成神仙的，果然把爵位富贵都抛了，也多得很。”王夫人哭道：“他若抛了父母，这就是不孝，怎能成佛作祖？”探春道：“大凡一个人，不可有奇处。二哥哥生来带块玉来，都道是好事，这么说起来，都是有了这块玉的不好。若是再有几天不见，我不是叫太太生气，就有些原故了，只好譬如没有生这位哥哥罢了。果然有来头成了正果，也是太太几辈子的修积。”宝钗听了不言语。袭人那里忍得住，心里一疼，头上一晕，便栽倒了。王夫人看着可怜，命人扶他回去。\n　　贾环见哥哥侄儿中了，又为巧姐的事，大不好意思，只抱怨蔷芸两个。知道探春回来，此事不肯干休，又不敢躲开，这几天竟是如在荆棘之中。\n　　次日，贾兰只得先去谢恩，知道甄宝玉也中了，大家序了同年。提起贾宝玉心迷走失，甄宝玉叹息劝慰。知贡举的将考中的卷子奏闻，皇上一一的披阅，看取中的文章，俱是平正通达的。见第七名贾宝玉是金陵籍贯，第一百三十名又是金陵贾兰，皇上传旨询问：“两个姓贾的是金陵人氏，是否贾妃一族？”大臣领命出来，传贾宝玉、贾兰问话。贾兰将宝玉场后迷失的话，并将三代陈明，大臣代为转奏。皇上最是圣明仁德，想起贾氏功勋，命大臣查复。大臣便细细的奏明。皇上甚是悯恤，命有司将贾赦犯罪情由，查案呈奏。皇上又看到“海疆靖寇班师善后事宜”一本，奏的是“海宴河清，万民乐业”的事。皇上圣心大悦，命九卿叙功议赏，并大赦天下。贾兰等朝臣散后，拜了座师，并听见朝内有大赦的信，便回了王夫人等。合家略有喜色，只盼宝玉回来。薛姨妈更加喜欢，便要打算赎罪。\n　　一日，人报甄老爷同三姑爷来道喜，王夫人便命贾兰出去接待。不多一时，贾兰进来，笑嘻嘻的回王夫人道：“太太们大喜了。甄老爷在朝内听见有旨意，说是大爷爷的罪名免了；珍大爷不但免了罪，仍袭了宁国三等世职。荣国世职，仍是爷爷袭了，俟丁忧服满，仍升工部郎中。所抄家产，全行赏还。二叔的文章，皇上看了甚喜。问知元妃兄弟，北静王还奏说人品亦好，皇上传旨召见。众大臣奏称：‘据伊侄贾兰回称出场时迷失，现在各处寻访。’皇上降旨，着五营各衙门用心寻访。这旨意一下，请太太们放心，皇上这样圣恩，再没有找不着的。”王夫人等这才大家称贺，喜欢起来。\n　　只有贾环等心下着急，四处找寻巧姐。那知巧姐随了刘老老，带着平儿出了城，到了庄上，刘老老也不敢轻亵巧姐，便打扫上房，让给巧姐平儿住下。每日供给，虽是乡村风味，倒也洁净；又有青儿陪着，暂且宽心。那庄上也有几家富户，知道刘老老家来了贾府姑娘，谁不来瞧，都道是天上神仙。也有送菜果的，也有送野味的，倒也热闹。内中有个极富的人家姓周，家财巨万，良田千顷，只有一子，生得文雅清秀，年纪十四岁。他父母延师读书，新近科试，中了秀才。那日他母亲看见巧姐，心里羡慕，自想：“我是庄家人家，那里配得起这样世家小姐？”只顾呆想。刘老老早看出他的心事来，便说：“你的心事我知道了，我给你们做个媒罢。”周妈妈笑道：“你别哄我。他们什么人家，肯给我们庄家人？”刘老老道：“说着瞧罢。”于是两人各自走开。\n　　刘老老惦记着贾府，叫板儿进城打听。那日恰好到宁荣街，只见有好些车轿在那里，板儿便在邻近打听。说是：“宁荣两府复了官，赏还抄的家产，如今府里又要起来了。只是他们的宝玉中了官，不知走到那里去了。”板儿心里喜欢，便要回去。又见好几匹马到来，在门前下马，只见门上打千儿请安，说：“二爷回来了，大喜！大老爷身上安了么？”那位爷笑着道：“好了，又遇恩旨，就要回来了。”还问：“那些人做什么的？”门上回说：“是皇上派官在这里下旨意，叫人领家产。那位爷便喜喜欢欢的进去。板儿料是贾琏，也不再打听，赶忙回去告诉他外祖母。刘老老听说，喜的眉开眼笑，去给巧姐儿道喜，将板儿的话说了一遍。平儿笑说道：“可是亏了老老这样一办，不然，姑娘也摸不着这好时候儿了。”巧姐更自喜欢。正说着，那送贾琏信的人也回来了，说是：“姑老爷感激得很，叫我一到家，快把姑娘送回去。又赏了我好几两银子。”刘老老听了得意，便叫人赶了两辆车，请巧姐平儿上车。巧姐等在刘老老家住熟了，反是依依不舍，更有青儿哭着，恨不能留下。刘老老见他不忍相别，便叫青儿跟了进城，一径直奔荣府而来。\n　　且说贾琏先前知道贾赦病重，赶到配所，父子相见，痛哭一场，渐渐的好起来。贾琏接着家书，知道家中的事，禀明贾赦回来。走到中途，听得大赦，又赶了两天，今日到家，恰遇颁赏恩旨。里面邢夫人等正愁无人接旨，虽有贾兰，终是年轻。人报琏二爷回来，大家相见，悲喜交集。此时也不及叙话，即到前厅，叩见了。钦命大人问了他父亲好，说：“明日到内府领赏。宁国府第，发交居住。”众人起身辞别。\n　　贾琏送出门去，见有几辆屯车，家人们不许停歇，正在吵闹。贾琏早知道是巧姐来的车，便骂家人道：“你们这一起湖涂忘八崽子！我不在家，就欺心害主，将姐儿都逼走了。如今人家送来，还要拦阻，必是你们和我有什么仇么？”众家人原怕贾琏回来不依，想来少时才破，岂知贾琏说得更明，心下不懂，只得站着回道：“二爷出门，奴才们有病的，有告假的，都是三爷、蔷大爷、芸二爷作主，不与奴才们相干。“贾琏道：“什么混账东西！我完了事，再和你们说。快把车赶进来！”\n　　贾琏进去，见邢夫人也不言语，转身到了王夫人那里，跪下磕了个头，回道：“姐儿回来了，全亏太太周全。环兄弟也不用说他了。只是芸儿这东西，他上回看家就闹乱儿，如今我去了几个月，便闹到这样。回太太的话：这种人撵了他不往来也使得的！”王夫人道：“王仁这下流种子为什么也是这样坏！”贾琏道：“太太不用说了，我自有道理。”正说着，彩云等回道：“姐儿进来了！”于是巧姐儿见了王夫人。虽然别不多时，想起那样逃难的景况，不免落下泪来。巧姐儿也便大哭。贾琏忙过来道谢了刘老老。王夫人便拉他坐下，说起那日的话来。贾琏见了平儿，外面不好说别的，心里十分感激，眼中不觉流泪。自此，益发敬重平儿，打算等贾赦回来，要扶平儿为正。此是后话，暂且不提。\n　　只说邢夫人正恐贾琏不见了巧姐，必有一番的周折；又听见贾琏在王夫人那里，心下更是着急，便叫丫头去打听。回来说是巧姐儿同着刘老老在那里说话儿呢，邢夫人才如梦初觉，知是他们弄鬼，还抱怨王夫人：“调唆的我母子不和！到底不知是那个送信给平儿的？”正问着，只见巧姐同着刘老老，带了平儿，王夫人在后头跟着进来。先把头里的话都说在贾芸、王仁身上，说：“大太太原是听见人说，为的是好事。那里知道外头的鬼？”邢夫人听了，自觉羞惭，想起王夫人主意不差，心里也服。于是邢、王二夫人，彼此倒心下相安了。\n   平儿回了王夫人，带了巧姐到宝钗那里来请安，各自提各自的苦处。又说到：“皇上隆恩，咱们家该兴旺起来了。想来宝二爷必回来的。”正说到这句话，知见秋纹慌慌张张的跑来说道：“袭人不好了！”\n不知何事，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Yinger, puzzled by Baoyu’s remarks, was turning to go when he continued: “Silly child, let me tell you. Since your mistress is destined to good fortune, you who attend her will naturally share it. But Xiren is not to be counted on. Just serve your mistress well in future and you may be rewarded. It won’t have been for nothing, your working so hard for her all this time.”\n\nYinger thought the first part of this made sense but not the last. She said, “I understand. My mistress is waiting for me. If you want some fruit, sir, just send a maid to call me.”\n\nBaoyu nodded and she left.\n\nPresently Bacchai and Xiren came back and went to their own rooms, no more of this.\n\nA few days later the time for the examination arrived. The others simply assumed that since father and son were good essay-writers they were bound to pass. Bacchai alone, though pleased to see Baoyu studying hard, was disturbed because he seemed so cool and detached. Knowing that he and Lan were going to the examination, her first fear was that as this was their first time they might have some accident in the crowd; secondly, since the monk’s departure Baoyu had never left the house, and though she was glad that he was studying hard, the speed with which he had changed for the better made her suspect that something was afoot. So the day before the examination she sent Xiren with some young maids and Suyun to help the two of them pack, after which she checked their things herself and put them away ready. She also asked Li Wan to report to the Lady Dowager that some elderly, dependable servants had been assigned to accompany them to prevent them from being jostled by the crowd.\n\nThe next day, Baoyu and Jia Lan changed into none-too-new clothes and cheerfully went to take leave of the Lady Dowager, who beamingly cautioned them, “Although this is your first time at the examination, you’re not boys any more, so I’m not worried. Still, you’ve never spent a single day away from me. Even when you weren’t with me, your maids and nurses were in constant attendance — you’ve never had to sleep all on your own. Now you’ll each be in a separate cell, with no one to wait on you; you must take good care of yourselves. Finish your papers quickly and come home as soon as you can to set our minds at rest.” Her voice faltered as she said this.\n\nJia Lan assented to everything, but Baoyu said nothing. When she had finished he stepped forward and knelt to her. His eyes brimming with tears he kowtowed three times.\n\n“I shall never be able to repay you for giving me life, mother,” he said. “But if I do well in this examination and pass as a provincial graduate, that will please you and make up for all my past faults.”\n\nThis reduced her to tears. “It’s good of you to have such an ambition,” she sobbed, “but it’s a pity your grandmother couldn’t live to see this day!” She pulled him to her.\n\nBut Baoyu remained kneeling. “Even if she can’t see me, she’ll know and be glad,” he said. “That’s just as good as if she saw it. Our separation is only physical, not spiritual.”\n\nLi Wan was afraid that this would upset Baoyu again and bring on his illness, and the whole situation struck her as inauspicious. She stepped forward to urge, “Why should you be so upset, madam, over such a happy event? Besides, Brother Baoyu has been so good and dutiful lately and studied so hard. If he takes his nephew in to write good papers and come home early to show them to our old family friends, we can wait for good news.”\n\nBaoyu and Jia Lan had both reported good news, that was all. She told the maids to help Baoyu up, but he turned to make Li Wan a bow.\n\n“Set your heart at rest, sister-in-law,” he said. “We two are bound to pass. Later Lan will have an even more brilliant career, and you will wear a phoenix coronet and robes of state.”\n\n“If your prophecy comes true, cousin, all my hardships won’t have been....” She broke off for fear of distressing Lady Wang again.\n\nBaoyu assured her, “So long as you have a good son to carry on the ancestral line, even if my elder brother can’t see it, his wishes will have been fulfilled.”\n\nAs it was growing late, Li Wan simply nodded and did not like to detain him any longer with conversation.\n\nBaochai had listened in consternation. Not only Baoyu’s words but even those of Lady Wang and Li Wan struck her as inauspicious; yet she dared not take them seriously and could only hold back her tears in silence.\n\nBaoyu now stepped up to her and made her a deep bow. The others, nonplussed by his behaviour, could not help smiling at him. But when they saw Baochai burst into tears they were aghast.\n\n“I am going now, sister,” he said. “Do look after our mother and wait for the good news.”\n\n“It is time to start,” she answered. “There is no need to say any more.”\n\n“So you are hurrying me too? Well, I know I must be going.” He turned then and saw that everyone was there except Xichun and Zijuan. “Tell my fourth sister and Zijuan for me that there is no need to see me off,” he said.\n\nHis words sounded half rational, half crazy. The others put it down to the fact that he had never gone out before and attributed this to Lady Wang’s foolish talk. They thought the best thing was to speed his departure.\n\n“There are people waiting outside for you,” they said. “If you delay any more, you will be late.”\n\nBaoyu threw back his head and laughed. “I’m going! This is the end of all this foolery!”\n\nThe rest chimed in, “Go quickly!”\n\nOnly Lady Wang and Baochai felt as if this were a last farewell. Their tears flowed like rain and they nearly gave way to sobs. But Baoyu, laughing wildly, went out as if in a frenzy. Indeed:\n\nHe leaves the world of men, its fame and gain;\nBreaks out of the cage that has him confined.\n\nLeaving Baoyu and Jia Lan to set off for the examination, let us turn to Jia Huan. He was both angry and mortified to see them go. Now that he was the only man left in the family he swaggered about boastfully.\n\n“Now I can avenge my mother!” he thought. “With no man at home, if the Elder Mistress backs me up I’ve nobody to fear.”\n\nHaving made up his mind to this, he went to pay his respects to Lady Xing and flattered her so that she was quite taken in.\n\n“Now I can see you are a good boy,” she said. “In the matter of Qiaojie, I should have been the one to decide. Your Cousin Lian is a fool. Instead of consulting his own grandmother, he turned to outsiders.”\n\nJia Huan said, “The other family have stated that they only recognize our house. Now that this is settled, they will be sending Your Ladyship handsome gifts. With a princeling for a grandson-in-law, you needn’t worry that the Elder Master won’t get a high post! Not that I like to criticize my own family, but since my elder sister became an Imperial Consort they’ve been unbearably arrogant. I hope Qiaojie won’t turn out the same way. I mean to ask her.”\n\n“You should tell her, so that she knows whom she has to thank,” said Lady Xing. “Her father would never have found her such a good match at home. But that fool Pinger says this is no good. She claims that your aunt is against it too....”\n\nWilling, I’m sure. I’m afraid they may be trying to take advantage of us. If we delay and your uncle Lian comes back, he may listen to other people and call it off.”\n\n“It’s settled on their side,” said Jia Huan. “All they’re waiting for is the date of birth from Her Ladyship. The prince’s household has ruled that the wedding must take place three days from now. But there’s one problem: they’re afraid you may not agree because they say they shouldn’t marry the granddaughter of an official who’s a convict. They propose taking her over quietly first, then when the old master is pardoned and reinstated, they can celebrate in style.”\n\n“Why shouldn’t I agree? That’s only right and proper.”\n\n“In that case, will you write out the date for them, madam?”\n\n“Silly boy! There are only women here. Get young Qiang to write it for you.”\n\nJia Huan, overjoyed, assented and hurried out to tell Jia Yun and invite Wang Ren to the prince’s residence to draw up the contract and receive the silver.\n\nNow the maid attending Lady Xing had overheard this conversation. She had begged Pinger’s help to get this job, and she seized this chance to go and report all that had been said to her. Pinger, who knew that this boded ill, had already explained the situation to Qiaojie. The girl had wept all night, insisting that they must wait for her father’s return to decide the matter; she would not obey the old lady. When she heard this latest report she broke down again, and wanted to go and reason with Lady Xing. But Pinger stopped her.\n\n“Don’t be in such a hurry, miss,” she urged. “Her Ladyship is your own grandmother. She says that since your father’s away she can decide this, and besides your uncle is the guarantor. They’re all in this together — how can you argue with them all single-handed? As a servant, I have no say in the matter. We must think of some way out, but we mustn’t do anything rash.”\n\nThe maid from Lady Xing’s apartment warned them, “Do think of a plan quickly, or they’ll carry her off!” With that she left.\n\nPinger turned to see Qiaojie crying as if her heart would break. She helped her up, saying, “It’s no use crying, miss. Now that your father’s away, from the way they talk....”\n\nBefore she could finish, a maid came from Lady Xing to announce, “This happy event for the young lady has been settled. Pinger is to get all her things ready. As for the dowry, that was to be fixed by Master Lian on his return.” Pinger had to agree to this.\n\nJust then Lady Wang arrived. Qiaojie threw herself into her arms, weeping.\n\n“Don’t worry, child,” said Lady Wang tearfully. “I’ve had a big row with Her Ladyship over you, but it looks as if we can’t stop her. We’ll have to play for time by agreeing, and send a servant at once to inform your father.”\n\n“Don’t you know, madam, that this morning the third master told Her Ladyship that according to the prince’s rule the wedding must take place three days from now? Her Ladyship has already told Yun to write the date of birth and send it over. How can we wait for Master Lian?”\n\nHearing that Jia Huan was involved, Lady Wang was speechless with rage. After a pause she called for him repeatedly, but after some time the servants came back to report, “Master Huan went out first thing this morning with Master Qiang and Master Wang.”\n\n“Where is Master Yun?” she asked.\n\n“We don’t know,” they answered.\n\nAll Qiaojie’s maids were in consternation, at a complete loss. And as Lady Wang could hardly take issue with Lady Xing, they could only cling together and weep.\n\nIn the midst of this commotion an old serving-woman came in to announce, “The men on the back gate say that Granny Liu is here again.”\n\nLady Wang said, “We’re in trouble here; we’ve no time to entertain visitors. Send her away.”\n\n“You should ask her in, madam,” urged Pinger.\n\nGranny Liu, as the child’s godmother, should be told.” Lady Wang said nothing, so the woman went to fetch Granny Liu.\n\nWhen she came in and they had exchanged greetings, the old woman was puzzled to see that all their eyes were red.\n\n“What’s happened?” she asked after a pause. “Is the mistress and you young ladies missing Second Mistress?”\n\nAt this reference to her mother, Qiaojie burst out crying.\n\n“Don’t talk about that, granny,” said Pinger. “As her godmother you should be told the truth.” She explained the situation, which horrified Granny Liu. After a while, however, the old woman chuckled.\n\n“A clever girl like you should know those ways described in the drum-ballads. There are plenty of tricks to get over this. What’s so difficult?”\n\n“What trick do you know, granny? Tell us quickly!” urged Pinger.\n\n“It’s easy. Just slip away without letting anyone know, and that will be that.”\n\n“Nonsense. How can people in a family like ours go away somewhere?”\n\n“If you’re willing to, you can come to my village. I’ll hide the young lady, then send my son-in-law to find Master Qiaojie’s father-in-law and take a letter from her; and he’s bound to come. Won’t that be fine?”\n\n“But what if the Elder Mistress finds out?”\n\n“Does she know that I’ve come?”\n\n“She lives at the front, and is so hard on the servants that no one will tell her any news. If you’d come by the front gate she might know; but as you came by the back, that’s all right.”\n\n“Then let’s decide on a date, and I’ll send my son-in-law with a cart to fetch her.”\n\n“How can we wait for that? Sit down here.”\n\nPinger hurried in to report this privately to Lady Wang, who thought it over and felt it would not do.\n\n“We’ve no other way out, madam,” said Pinger. “It’s for your sake that I’m telling you this. You can pretend to know nothing about it, and just ask the Elder Mistress later. We shall be able to send to Master Lian, and he should be back soon.”\n\nLady Wang said nothing, but sighed.\n\nWhen Qiaojie heard this, she begged her, “Do save me, aunt! My father will be very grateful to you when he comes back.”\n\n“Say no more,” Pinger told her. “Go back now, madam, and just send someone to keep an eye on her room.”\n\n“Keep this dark,” warned Lady Wang. “But you two will need clothes and bedding.”\n\n“We must hurry to make it work. If they come back to press us, there’ll be trouble.”\n\nThis brought Lady Wang to a decision. “All right, go ahead quickly,” she said. “I’ll take the responsibility.”\n\nSo she went back and engaged Lady Xing in small-talk to keep her there, while Pinger made arrangements, giving orders: “Don’t try to avoid people. If anyone comes and sees you, just say the Elder Mistress has ordered a cart to take Granny Liu home.” She also bribed the men at the back gate to hire a cart. Then she dressed Qiaojie as a country girl and they slipped out. Later, on the pretext of seeing Granny Liu off, Pinger climbed into the cart herself when no one was watching.\n\nAlthough the back gate of the Rong Mansion was open, there were only one or two men on duty there. The other servants, because the compound was so big and short-handed, were too busy to attend to everything. Besides, Lady Xing was not the sort to show any consideration for servants. Though the servants knew that this was wrong, they were so grateful to Pinger that they acted in collusion to let Qiaojie escape. And Lady Xing, chatting with Lady Wang, had no inkling of this. Only Lady Wang was uneasy.\n\nAfter a little talk she slipped over to Baochai’s rooms and sat down there, still feeling very upset. Noticing her distraught look, Baochai asked, “Is something worrying you, madam?”\n\nLady Wang told her in private what had happened.\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Baochai. “We must quickly send to stop Master Yun.”\n\n“I can’t find Huan,” said Lady Wang.\n\n“You must pretend to know nothing about it, madam, while I send someone to inform the Elder Mistress.”\n\nLady Wang nodded and left Baochai to decide whom to send.\n\nNow the prince, wanting to buy some maids, had sent servants to inspect the girls recommended by the go-between. When these men reported back and he questioned them, not daring to hide the truth they told him the facts. Horrified to learn that this was an old, noble family, the prince exclaimed, “This is a serious infringement of the law! We nearly made a bad blunder. As I’ve already had audience with the Emperor, I shall be choosing a day to set off soon. If any more people come about this, drive them away!”\n\nIt so happened that Jia Yun and Wang Ren that day brought the horoscope to the prince’s residence. The gatemen there told them, “His Highness has given orders that anyone pretending that girls from the Jia family are commoners is to be arrested and punished. In these peaceful times, who would dare do such a thing?”\n\nThis so frightened Wang Ren that he scurried away like a frightened rat, complaining about the man who had proposed this, and they dispersed in dismay.\n\nJia Huan was waiting at home for news when Lady Wang sent for him. In a fever of impatience he was stamping about irritably. At the sight of Jia Yun returning alone he demanded, “Is it settled?”\n\nJia Yun stamped one foot. “A fine mess!” he cried. “Someone must have split on us.” He reported how they had been rebuffed.\n\nJia Huan was speechless with rage. “This morning I made it sound so good to the Elder Mistress — what are we going to do now?” he fumed. “You’ve all let me down!”\n\nAs they were frantically casting about, they heard uproar inside and servants calling them by name, saying that both ladies wanted them. The two of them had to slink in. Lady Wang, her face dark with anger, snapped, “What a fine thing you’ve done! Now you’ve driven Qiaojie and Ping’er to their deaths. Bring back their corpses at once if you know what’s good for you!”\n\nThey fell on their knees. Jia Huan, too terrified to speak, hung his head. But Jia Yun said, “I wouldn’t dare do anything wrong, madam. It was because Uncle Xing and Uncle Wang proposed a match for cousin Qiaojie that we reported it to you. The Elder Mistress agreed and told me to write a card. The other family didn’t want her — how can you say we drove her to death?”\n\n“Huan told the Elder Mistress that in three days she’d be carried off. Is this the way to arrange a match? I won’t argue now. Just return Qiaojie to us, and when the master comes back we’ll see about this!”\n\nLady Xing, unable to get a word in edgeways, could only shed tears. Lady Wang rounded on Jia Huan. “That bitch Concubine Zhao has produced a whelp just as worthless as herself!” she swore, then called her maids to support her back to her own apartments.\n\nJia Huan, Jia Yun and Lady Xing started blaming each other. “It’s no use recriminating now,” they said. “We don’t think they’re really dead. Most likely Ping’er has taken her to hide with some relatives.”\n\nLady Xing summoned the servants from the inner and outer gates and demanded, “Where have Qiaojie and Ping’er gone?”\n\nBut the servants answered with one voice, “Don’t ask us, madam. Ask the gentlemen in charge. There’s no need for you to storm either. When our mistress questions us, we have plenty to say. If anyone is to be beaten, let all be beaten. If anyone is to be dismissed, let all be dismissed....”\n\nAfter Jia Lian’s departure things went from bad to worse outside. No monthly allowances were issued, and the men gambled, drank, fooled around with actresses and even brought prostitutes into the mansion. Was this the way for masters to behave? Jia Yun and the others were at a loss for an answer.\n\nThen Lady Wang sent to urge the young men to make a thorough search. Jia Huan and the rest were in a dilemma, wishing they could hide themselves underground, yet not daring to question Qiaojie’s servants. They knew that everyone hated them and that Baoyu must have gone into hiding; but how could they say this to Lady Wang? They simply had to make inquiries among all their relatives, but without any success. Lady Xing inside the mansion and Jia Huan and his pack outside kept everyone in a ferment day and night for the next few days.\n\nWhen the day for the end of the examination came, Lady Wang simply waited for Baoyu and Jia Lan to come home. But by noon there was no sign of them, and she, Li Wan and Baochai, very worried, sent servants to their lodgings to find out the reason. The first messengers did not return and had no news; nor did the second batch. The three women were burning with anxiety.\n\nIt was evening when someone came in. It was Jia Lan. Their relief was short-lived, for without paying his respects he sobbed, “Uncle Baoyu has disappeared!”\n\nLady Wang, stunned, could not utter a word. She collapsed on her couch, and it took Caiyun and the others some time to revive her. As she wept, she saw that Baochai was dumbstruck too while Xiren was crying as if her heart would break. Through her tears Lady Wang scolded Jia Lan, “You stupid boy! Why did you let your Second Uncle vanish when you were with him?”\n\n“We ate and slept together in our lodgings, and in the examination hall we weren’t far apart — I was with him all the time. This morning he finished his paper very early and waited for me. We handed in our papers together and came out, but in the crowd at the gate we got separated. I couldn’t find him. The servants who’d come to meet us asked me where he was. Li Gui said, ‘I saw him only a few paces away; how could he vanish in the crowd?’ I told Li Gui and the others to search for him while I took some men to look through all the cells, but he wasn’t there. That’s why I’m so late back.”\n\nLady Wang was unable to speak for weeping. Baochai had a rough idea of the truth. Xiren was crying her heart out. Jia Qiang and the rest, without waiting to be ordered, went off to make a search. The whole household of the Rong Mansion was grief-stricken, and the feast prepared to celebrate the candidates’ return was left untouched. Jia Lan, forgetting his own exhaustion, wanted to go out again to search, but Lady Wang stopped him.\n\n“My child,” she said, “your uncle’s lost; can we risk losing you too? You must rest now, there’s a good boy!” He was unwilling to stay, however, and Madam You and the others had to plead with him.\n\nXichun alone had understood the truth, but felt she should not speak out. She asked Baochai, “Did Cousin Baoyu take his jade with him?”\n\n“Of course he did. He always wore it.”\n\nAt that Xichun said no more, while Xiren, recalling how he had tried to smash the jade, guessed that the monk had something to do with his disappearance. She was heart-broken, and wept as she remembered how good Baoyu had always been to her. “If I offended him, he would be angry, but he had such winning ways. I need hardly say how considerate he was. And if I provoked him too much, he would swear to become a monk. Who could have known that he’d really do that?”\n\nBut enough of Xiren’s grief.\n\nThe fourth watch sounded, but still no news came. Li Wan, afraid that Lady Wang was exhausting herself, urged her to go to her room to rest, and all the others attended her there except Lady Xing who went back alone. Jia Huan had hidden himself, not daring to appear.\n\nLady Wang had sent Jia Lan away, and passed a sleepless night. The next morning, although the servants who had been sent out to search came back, they all reported: \"We have searched everywhere without success. There is not a trace of him.\" Then Aunt Xue, Xue Ke, Xiangyun, Baoqin and Aunt Li came in rapid succession to inquire after Lady Wang and ask for news.\n\nThis went on for several days. Lady Wang was so distraught that she could neither eat nor drink, and her life was in danger. Then suddenly a servant announced: \"A man has arrived from the coast, sent by the Military Commander. He says that our Third Mistress will be reaching the capital tomorrow.\" This news of Tanchun’s arrival, although it could not dispel Lady Wang’s grief for Baoyu, came as a slight relief to her. The next day Tanchun did indeed return. The family went out to meet her at a distance, and saw how she had grown even more beautiful than before and was splendidly attired. When she saw Lady Wang’s haggard appearance and the others’ tear-stained faces, she too began to weep. After a while, she paid her formal respects to them. She was most upset to see Xichun dressed as a Taoist nun. And when she heard of Baoyu’s mysterious disappearance and the many other misfortunes that had befallen the family, they all wept again. But Tanchun was an intelligent and articulate girl, and she succeeded gradually in talking them round and comforting them a little. Lady Wang was somewhat calmed. The next day, Tanchun’s husband also came. When he heard what had happened, he urged Tanchun to stay on for a few days to help comfort the family. Her maids and serving-women were able to meet the other maids, and they all exchanged news. From then on, high and low in the household spent all their time, day and night, waiting for news of Baoyu.\n\nThen one day, in the small hours of the morning, several servants came in from outside and announced at the inner gate that they had good news. Some junior maids came running in, too excited to inform the senior maids first.\n\n\"Congratulations, madam! Congratulations, young mistresses!\" they cried as they burst into the room.\n\nLady Wang assumed that Baoyu had been found, and rose cheerfully to her feet.\n\n\"Where was he found? Bring him in at once!\"\n\n\"Master Bao has passed the provincial examination, and come seventh on the list!\" announced one of the servants.\n\n\"Where is he then?\" asked Lady Wang. The servant said nothing, and she sat down again.\n\n\"Who was the seventh candidate?\" asked Tanchun.\n\n\"Master Bao,\" replied the servant.\n\nJust then they heard an outcry from outside: \"Master Lan has passed too!\"\n\nThe servant hurried out, and returned with the official announcement: Jia Lan had come a hundred and thirtieth on the list. Li Wan was naturally delighted, but as Baoyu was still missing she tried to conceal her joy. Lady Wang was pleased to hear of Jia Lan’s success, but thought to herself: \"If only Baoyu would return, how happy we should all be!\" Baochai alone was overcome with grief. But she could not give way to her tears. The others came to offer their congratulations.\n\n\"If Baoyu has the destiny of a graduate, then he cannot be lost. He is sure to turn up in a day or two.\"\n\nLady Wang supposed they were right and managed a smile. They seized this opportunity to urge her to take more nourishment.\n\nFrom outside the third gate came Bao Yong’s voice, bellowing: \"I said our young master could never get lost, not after passing the examination! It’s a case of:\n\n’Success makes the whole world known to you!’\n\nWherever he’s gone, they’ll know who he is now. No one would dare not send him back!\"\n\nThe servants inside commented: \"The fellow may be a boor, but he’s talking sense.\"\n\nXichun observed: \"A grown man doesn’t just get lost. I’m afraid he has seen through the red dust of this world and become a monk. If that is so, it will be hard ever to find him again.\"\n\nThis reduced Lady Wang and the rest to tears again.\n\nLi Wan said: \"There have been plenty of cases since ancient times of people abandoning rank and wealth to become Buddhas or immortals.\"\n\n\"But if he has abandoned his own parents,\" sobbed Lady Wang, \"that is an unfilial act. How can he become a Buddha?\"\n\nTanchun said: \"This is all because from childhood Bao\n\n“Everyone says it’s a good thing to have brought that jade with him,” she observed. “But from the way you talk, it seems to have brought nothing but trouble. If he doesn’t turn up in the next few days, to avoid vexing Her Ladyship I shall have to assume that there’s some reason for it and that I was never fated to have a brother. If he really has become an immortal, that will be thanks to Her Ladyship’s virtue accumulated over many lifetimes.” Baochai made no comment.\n\nXiren could contain herself no longer. Her heart ached and dizziness overcame her; she collapsed in a faint. The Lady Dowager, distressed, ordered the maids to help her to her room.\n\nJia Huan, embarrassed by the success of his elder brother and nephew and by the business of Qiaojie, vented his spleen on Jia Qiang and Jia Yun. He knew that when Tanchun came home she would not let the matter rest, yet he dared not hide himself. He spent these days as if treading on thorns.\n\nThe next day, Jia Lan had to go to offer thanks for the imperial favour and found that Zhen Bao-yu had passed too; so they exchanged cards and declared themselves ‘classmates’. When Jia Lan told him of Bao-yu’s disappearance, Zhen sighed sympathetically.\n\nThe chief examiner presented the Palace with the test papers of the successful candidates, and the Emperor perused them one by one, finding them all sound and lucid. Noticing that the seventh candidate, Jia Bao-yu, was a native of Jinling, and the hundred and thirtieth, Jia Lan, was also from the Jia family of Jinling, he made enquiries:\n\n“Are these two Jias members of the consort’s family?”\n\nAn official was sent to summon Bao-yu and Jia Lan for an audience. Jia Lan informed him of Bao-yu’s disappearance after the examination and gave an account of his own antecedents, which the official reported to the Emperor. The sagacious, benevolent monarch, remembering the Jia family’s meritorious services, ordered a ministerial investigation. A detailed report was submitted, and the Emperor in his compassion decreed that the Board of Punishments should review Jia She’s case. Then, reading a report about the suppression of coastal bandits and the pacification of the coast, which described the country as being “in great tranquillity, the people happy in their work,” the Emperor in his delight ordered the ministers concerned to report on the achievements of those deserving rewards, and proclaimed a general amnesty.\n\nAfter the court was dismissed, Jia Lan called on the chief examiner and, learning that an amnesty would be declared, went home to report this to the Lady Dowager. The whole family was overjoyed, hoping that Bao-yu would soon be back. Aunt Xue in particular was delighted and started planning to redeem Xue Pan from penal servitude.\n\nOne day it was announced that Mr. Zhen and his son-in-law had called to offer congratulations, and the Lady Dowager sent Jia Lan out to receive them. Soon he came back beaming to report:\n\n“Congratulations, madam! Mr. Zhen heard at court that there is an edict: not only has Great-uncle She been pardoned, but Uncle Zhen has been acquitted and will inherit the Ningguo title of the third rank. Our mansion is to be returned to us, and Grandad will inherit the title of the first rank; after the period of mourning he will be promoted to an assistant secretaryship in the Board of Works. All our confiscated property is to be returned. The Emperor was very pleased with Uncle Bao’s papers, and when he learned that he was the brother of the Imperial Consort, the Prince of Beijing reported that he was a fine scholar too; so the Emperor has summoned him to an audience. The ministers told him that according to his nephew Jia Lan he disappeared after the examination and is being searched for everywhere. Then the Emperor decreed that all the yamens of the Five Barracks should make a careful search. So don’t worry, madam! The Emperor in his goodness is sure to have him found.”\n\nThen at last the Lady Dowager and the others congratulated each other, their spirits revived.\n\nOnly Jia Huan was frantic, searching high and low for Qiaojie. She, however, had gone with Granny Liu and Ping-erh out of the city to their village, where the old woman prepared the best room for the two girls, not presuming to treat them slightingly. Though the food she served was country fare, it was clean; and with Qing-erh to keep them company they were quite content. Some rich families in the village, hearing that a young lady from the Jia household was staying with Granny Liu, came to call and pronounced Qiaojie a celestial beauty. Some brought presents of fruit or game, so that quite a stir was made. Among the visitors was the son of a very rich man called Zhou, who had acres of good land and was their local magnate.\n\nElegant and refined, this fourteen-year-old youth had recently passed the district examination and become a licentiate. That day when his mother saw Qiaojie, she was filled with admiration and thought to herself: “We’re only farm folk; how could we ever be worthy of such an aristocratic young lady?” She was still wrapped up in these thoughts when Granny Liu, who had seen what was on her mind, said: “I know what you’re thinking. Shall I act as your go-between?”\n\n“You must be joking,” said Mrs. Zhou with a smile. “What family would they be, to marry into a farm household?”\n\n“We’ll see,” said Granny Liu. And they went their separate ways.\n\nGranny Liu was still thinking of the Jias and sent Baner to the city to make inquiries. He happened that day to go to Rongguo Street, where he found many carriages and sedan-chairs and made inquiries from the bystanders.\n\n“The two Rong and Ning Mansions have had their ranks and confiscated property restored to them,” he was told. “They’re on the up-grade again. But Master Bao of their house has passed the palace examination and then disappeared, nobody knows where.”\n\nBaner, overjoyed, was starting back when he saw several horsemen dismount at the gate, where the servants knelt to pay their respects, exclaiming, “So you’re back, sir! Congratulations! Is the old master well again?”\n\n“Yes, thanks,” the gentleman replied cheerfully. “Another edict of amnesty has been issued, so he’ll soon be coming home.” He asked, “Who are all those people there?”\n\nThe gatemen answered, “They are officials sent by the Emperor to announce another edict, ordering the return of your property, sir.”\n\nThe gentleman went in happily then, and Baner, assuming that this was Jia Lian, did not wait to find out more but hurried home to tell his grandmother. Granny Liu was so delighted that she beamed all over her face. She went to congratulate Qiaojie, telling her what Baner had reported.\n\n“We owe this to you, granny,” said Pinger. “But for you, the young lady would never have lived to see this day.”\n\nQiaojie was even more overjoyed. As they were talking, the messenger sent to Jia Lian came back.\n\n“The master is very grateful,” he announced. “He told me as soon as I reached home to bring the young lady back straight away.” He gave a tip of several taels of silver to the messenger.\n\nGranny Liu, feeling very proud of herself, had two carts prepared and asked Qiaojie and Pinger to get into them. But having stayed so long with her they were loath to leave, and Qinger was crying too, wishing she could keep them. Because they seemed so reluctant to part, the old woman told Qinger to go to the city with them, and they set out straight for the Rong Mansion.\n\nJia Lian, after hearing of his father’s critical illness, had hastened to his place of exile, where father and son had met and wept together. Then Jia She gradually recovered. Upon receiving a letter from home, Jia Lian had asked his father’s permission to return. On the way he heard of the amnesty and travelled post-haste for two days to reach home that day, just in time for the promulgation of the edict. Lady Xing and the others, at a loss whom to send to receive it — for Jia Lan was still too young — were delighted by the announcement of Jia Lian’s return. Their meeting was a mixture of joy and sorrow. But there was no time to talk as he went to the hall to kowtow to the imperial envoy, who inquired after his father’s health.\n\n“You are to go to the Inner Court tomorrow to receive the edict and your gifts,” he said. “The Ning Mansion is to be restored to you.” Then the envoy took his leave, and they saw him out.\n\nJia Lian, escorting him out, saw some carts which the servants would not allow to halt and there was a commotion. He knew that these must be the carts bringing Qiaojie back.\n\n“You stupid bastards!” he swore at the servants. “When I was away, you had the effrontery to drive the young lady out! Now that she’s been brought back, why raise such a racket? Do you have a grudge against me?”\n\nThe servants had been afraid that Jia Lian would call them to account on his return and would give them trouble; but they had not expected him to know the truth already. In consternation they had to kneel down.\n\n“When you were away, sir, some of us were ill or asked for leave,” they said. “The ones in charge were Master Huan, Master Qiang and Master Yun; we had nothing to do with it.”\n\n“You scoundrels!” he fumed. “...\n\n“The wretches! I’ll settle with them later. Drive the carriage in quickly!”\n\nJia Lian went in then to see Lady Xing, but as she was silent he turned and went to Lady Wang’s apartments. Falling on his knees to kowtow, he reported, “Thanks to your help, madam, my daughter is back. As for Huan, we need not speak of him now. But that rascal Jia Yun caused trouble the last time he was left in charge of the house, and now that I’ve been away for a few months he’s up to his tricks again. If I may say so, madam, such a scoundrel should be kicked out and forbidden ever to return.”\n\n“Why is that degenerate Wang Ren so wicked too?” she exclaimed.\n\n“Don’t speak of it, madam. I know how to deal with them.”\n\nAs they were talking, Caiyun and the other maids announced, “The young mistress is here.”\n\nThen Qiaojie saw Lady Wang. Although they had not been separated for long, the thought of the danger she had been in reduced her to tears, and she started sobbing. Jia Lian stepped forward to thank Granny Liu. Lady Wang made the old woman take a seat and described all that had happened that day. At sight of Pinger, Jia Lian could not express his feelings in front of the others; but he was so grateful that tears ran down his cheeks. From that day on he treated her with increasing respect, and after Jia She’s return he decided to make her his wife. But no more of this.\n\nLet us return to Lady Xing, who was afraid that because Jia Lian could not find Qiaojie there would be trouble. And when she heard that he had gone to Lady Wang’s place she felt even more apprehensive, and sent maids to find out what was happening. They came back to report that Qiaojie was there talking with Granny Liu. Then Lady Xing, as if waking from a dream, realized that they had been playing a trick on her. She complained to Lady Wang, “You’ve set my son against me! Who was it anyway who took word to Pinger?”\n\nEven as she asked, Qiaojie came in with Granny Liu and Pinger, followed by Lady Wang. They laid all the blame on Jia Yun and Wang Ren.\n\n“My lady only acted on hearsay, meaning well,” they said. “How could she know that there were villains outside?”\n\nThen Lady Xing, feeling rather ashamed and reflecting that Lady Wang had done the right thing, had to admit that she was in the wrong. So harmony was restored between the two ladies.\n\nPinger reported back to Lady Wang, then took Qiaojie to pay her respects to Baochai, and they described to each other all that they had suffered.\n\n“The Emperor’s goodness means that our family is going to prosper again,” they said. “So Baoyu is bound to come back.”\n\nAs they were speaking, Qiuwen came running in frantically.\n\n“Xiren’s done for!” she cried.\n\nTo know what had happened, read the following chapter."
