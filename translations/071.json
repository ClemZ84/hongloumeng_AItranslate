  "original": "话说贾母处两个丫头，匆匆忙忙来找宝玉，口里说道：“二爷快跟着我们走罢，老爷家来了。”宝玉听了，又喜又愁，只得忙忙换了衣服，前来请安。贾政正在贾母房中，连衣服未换，看见宝玉进来请安，心中自是喜欢，却又有些伤感之意。又叙了些任上的事情，贾母便说：“你也乏了，歇歇去罢。”贾政忙站起来，笑着答应了个“是”，又略站着说了几句话，才退出来。宝玉等也都跟过来。贾政自然问问他的工课，也就散了。\n　　原来贾政回京复命，因是学差，故不敢先到家中。珍、琏、宝玉头一天便迎出一站去，接见了。贾政先请了贾母的安，便命都回家伺候。次日面圣，诸事完毕，才回家来。又蒙恩赐假一月，在家歇息。因年景渐老，事重身衰，又近因在外几年，骨肉离异，今得宴然复聚，自觉喜幸不尽。一应大小事务，一概亦付之度外，只是看书，闷了便与清客们下棋吃酒，或日间在里边，母子夫妻，共叙天伦之乐。\n　　因今岁八月初三日乃贾母八旬大庆，又因亲友全来，恐筵宴排设不开，便早同贾赦及贾琏等商议，议定于七月二十八日起至八月初五日止，宁荣两处齐开筵宴。宁国府中单请官客，荣国府中单请堂客。大观园中收拾出缀锦阁并嘉荫堂等几处大地方来做退居。二十八日，请皇亲、驸马、王公、诸王、郡主、王姑、公主、国君、太君、夫人等，二十九日，便是阁府督镇及诰命等；三十日，便是诸官长及诰命并远近亲友及堂客。初一日，是贾赦的家宴；初二日，是贾政；初三日，是贾珍、贾琏；初四日，是贾府中合族长幼大小共凑家宴；初五日，是赖大林之孝等家下管事人等共凑一日。\n　　自七月上旬，送寿礼者便络绎不绝。礼部奉旨：钦赐金玉如意一柄，彩缎四端，金玉杯各四件，帑银五百两。元春又命太监送出金寿星一尊，沉香拐一支，伽楠珠一串，福寿香一盒，金锭一对，银锭四对，彩缎十二匹，玉杯四只。馀者自亲王驸马以及大小文武官员家，凡所来往者，莫不有礼，不能胜记。堂屋内设下大桌案，铺了红毡，将凡有精细之物都摆上，请贾母过目。先一二日，还高兴过来瞧瞧，后来烦了，也不过目，只说：“凤丫头收了，改日闷了再瞧。”\n　　至二十八日，两府中俱悬灯结彩，屏开鸾凤，褥设芙蓉，笙萧鼓乐之音，通衢越巷。宁府中，本日只有北静王、南安郡王、永昌驸马、乐善郡王并几位世交公侯荫袭；荣府中，南安王太姑、北静王妃并世交公侯诰命。贾母等皆是按品大妆迎接。大家厮见，先请至大观园内嘉荫堂，茶毕更衣，方出至荣庆堂上拜寿入席。大家谦逊半日，方才入座。上面两席是南北王妃，下面依序便是众公侯命妇。左边下手一席，陪客是锦乡侯诰命与临昌伯诰命；右边下手方是贾母主位。邢夫人、王夫人带领尤氏凤姐并族中几个媳妇，两溜雁翅站在贾母身后侍立。林之孝赖大家的带领众媳妇，都在竹帘外面，伺候上菜上酒。周瑞家的带领几个丫鬟，在围屏后伺候呼唤。凡跟来的人，早又有人款待，别处去了。\n　　一时参了场，台下一色十二个未留发的小丫头，都是小厮打扮，垂手伺候。须臾，一个捧了戏单至阶下，先递给回事的媳妇，这媳妇接了，才递给林之孝家的。林之孝家的用小茶盘托上，挨身入帘来，递给尤氏的侍妾佩凤，佩凤接了才奉与尤氏，尤氏托着走至上席。南安太妃谦让了一回，点了一出吉庆戏文，然后又让北静王妃，也点了一出。众人又让一回，命随便拣好的唱罢了。\n　　少时，菜已四献，汤始一道，跟来各家的放了赏，大家便更衣服入园来，另献好茶。南安太妃因问宝玉。贾母笑道：“今日几处庙里念保安延寿经，他跪经去了。”又问众小姐们。贾母笑道：“他们姊妹们病的病，弱的弱，见人腼腆，所以叫他们给我看屋子去了。有的是小戏子传了一班在那边厅上，陪着他姨娘家秭妹们也看戏呢。”南安太妃笑道：“既这样，叫人请来。”贾母回头命了凤姐儿，“去把史、薛、林四位姑娘带来。再只叫你三妹妹陪着来罢。”凤姐答应了，来至贾母这边，只见他姊妹们正吃果子看戏，宝玉也才从庙里跪经回来。凤姐说了，宝钗姊妹与黛玉、湘云五人来至园中，见了大众，俱请安问好。内中也有见过的，还有一两家不曾见过的，都齐声夸赞不绝。其中湘云最熟，南安太妃因笑道：“你在这里，听见我来了还不出来，还等请去！我明儿和你叔叔算帐。”因一手拉着探春，一手拉着宝钗，问：“十几岁了？”又连声夸赞，因又松了他两个，又拉着黛玉、宝琴，也着实细看，极夸一回，又笑道：“都是好的！不知叫我夸那一个的是。”早有人将备用礼物打点出几分来：金玉戒指各五个，腕香珠五串。南安太妃笑道：“你姊妹们别笑话，留着赏丫头们罢。”五人忙拜谢过。北静王妃也有五样礼物。馀者不必细说。\n　　吃了茶，园中略逛了一逛，贾母等因又让入席。南安太妃便告辞，说：“身上不快。今日若不来，实在使不得。因此，恕我竟先要告别了。”贾母等听说，也不便强留，大家又让了一回，送至园门，坐轿而去。接着北静王妃坐了一坐，也就告辞了。馀者也有终席的，也有不终席的。贾母劳乏了一日，次日便不见人，一应都是邢夫人款待。有那些世家子弟拜寿的，只到厅上行礼，贾赦、贾政、贾珍还礼看待，至宁府坐席，不在话下。\n　　这几日尤氏晚间也不回那府去，白日间待客，晚上陪贾母玩笑，又帮着凤姐料理出入大小器皿以及收放礼物。晚上往园内李氏房中歇宿。这日伏侍过贾母晚饭后，贾母因说：“你们乏了，我也乏了，早些找点子什么吃了，歇歇去罢。明儿还要起早呢。”尤氏答应着，退出去，到凤姐儿屋里来吃饭。凤姐儿正在楼上看着人收送来的围屏呢，只有平儿在屋里，给凤姐叠衣服。尤氏想起二姐儿在时多承平儿照应，便点着头儿，说道：“好丫头，你这么个好心人，难为在这里熬。”平儿把眼圈儿一红，忙拿话岔过去了。尤氏因笑问道：“你们奶奶吃了饭了没有？”平儿笑道：“吃饭么还不请奶奶去？”尤氏笑道：“既这么着，我别处找吃的去罢，饿的我受不得了。”说着就走。平儿忙笑道：“奶奶请回来，这里有饽饽，且点补些儿，回来再吃饭。”尤氏笑道：“你们忙忙的，我园里和他姐儿们闹去。”一面说一面走，平儿留不住，只得罢了。\n　　且说尤氏一径来至园中，只见园中正门和各处角门仍未关好，犹吊着各色彩灯，因回头命小丫头叫该班的女人。那丫鬟走入班房中，竟没一个人影，回来回了尤氏。尤氏便命传管家的女人。这丫头应了便出去，到二门外鹿顶内，乃是管事的女人议事取齐之所。到了这里，只有两个婆子分果菜吃。因问：“那一位管事的奶奶在这里？东府里的奶奶立等一位奶奶，有话吩咐。”这两个婆子只顾分菜果，又听见是东府里的奶奶，不大在心上，因就回说：“管家奶奶们才散了。”小丫头道：“既散了，你们家里传他去。”婆子道：“我们只管看屋子，不管传人，姑娘要传人，再派传人的去。”小丫头听了道：“嗳哟！这可反了！怎么你们不传去？你哄新来的，怎么哄起我来了。素日你们不传，谁传去？这会子打听了体己信儿，或是赏了那位管家奶奶的东西，你们争着狗颠屁股儿的传去，不知谁是谁呢！琏二奶奶要传，你们也敢这么回吗？”这婆子一则吃了酒，二则被这丫头揭着弊病，便羞恼成怒了，因回口道：“扯你的臊！我们的事传不传，不与你相干。你未从揭挑我们，你想想你那老子娘，在那边管家爷们跟前，比我们还更会溜呢。各门各户的，你有本事排揎你们那边的人去！我们这边，你离着还远些呢。”丫头听了，气白了脸，因说道：“好好，这话说的好！”一面转身进来回话。\n　　尤氏已早进园来，因遇见了袭人、宝琴、湘云三人，同着地藏庵的两个姑子正说故事玩笑。尤氏因说饿了，先到怡红院，袭人装了几样荤素点心出来给尤氏吃。那小丫头子一径找了来，气狠狠的把方才的话都说了。尤氏听了，半晌冷笑道：“这是两个什么人？”两个姑子笑推这丫头道：“你这姑娘好气性大，那糊涂老妈妈们的话，你也不该来回才是。咱们奶奶万金之体，劳乏了几日，黄汤辣水没吃，咱们只有哄他欢喜的，说这些话做什么？”袭人也忙笑拉他出去，说：“好妹子，你且出去歇歇，我打发人叫他们去。”尤氏道：“你不用叫人，你去就叫这两个老婆来，到那边把他们家的凤姐叫来。”袭人笑道：“我请去。”尤氏笑道：“偏不用你。”两个姑子忙立起身来笑说：“奶奶素日宽洪大量，今日老祖宗千秋，奶奶生气，岂不惹人议论？”宝琴、湘云二人也都笑劝。尤氏道：“不为老太太的千秋，我一定不依。且放着就是了。”\n　　说话之间，袭人早又遣了一个丫头去到园门外找人。可巧遇见周瑞家的，这小丫头子就把这话告诉他了。周瑞家的虽不管事，因他素日仗着王夫人的陪房，原有些体面，心性乖滑，专惯各处献勤讨好，所以各房主子都喜欢他。他今日听了这话，忙跑入怡红院，一面飞走，一面说：“可了不得，气坏了奶奶了。偏我不在跟前。且打他们几个耳刮子，再等过了这几天算账！”尤氏见了他，也便笑道：“周姐姐你来，有个理你说说：这早晚园门还大开着，明灯蜡烛，出入的人又杂，倘有不防的事，如何使得。因此，叫该班的人吹灯关门。谁知一个人牙儿也没有！”周瑞家的道：“这还了得！前儿二奶奶还吩咐过的，今儿就没了人。过了这几日，必要打几个才好。”尤氏又说小丫头子的话。周瑞家的说；“奶奶不用生气。等过了事，我告诉管事的，打他个贼死，只问他们谁说‘各门各户’的话。我已经叫他们吹灯关门呢。奶奶也别生气了。”正乱着，只见凤姐儿打发人来请吃饭。尤氏道：“我也不饿了，才吃了几个饽饽，请你奶奶自己吃罢。”\n　　一时，周瑞家的出去，便把方才之事回了凤姐。凤姐便命：“将那两个的名字记上，等过了这几日，捆了送到那府里，凭大奶奶开发。或是打，或是开恩，随他就完了。什么大事！”周瑞家的听了，巴不得一声，素日因与这几个人不睦，出来了便命一个小厮到林之孝家去传凤姐的话，立刻叫林之孝家的进来见大奶奶；一面又传人立刻捆起这两个婆子来，交到马圈里，派人看守。林之孝家的不知甚么事，忙坐车进来，先见凤姐。至二门上，传进话去，丫头们出来说：“奶奶才歇下了。大奶奶在园内，叫大娘见见大奶奶就是了。”林之孝家的只得进园来，到稻香村。丫鬟们回进去。\n尤氏听了，反过不去，忙唤进他来，因笑向他道：“我不过为找人找不着，因问你；你既去了，也不是什么大事，谁又把你叫进来？倒叫你白跑一趟。不大的事，已经撂过手了。”林之孝家的也笑回道：“二奶奶打发人传我，说奶奶有话吩咐。”尤氏道：“大约周姐姐说的。你家去歇着罢，没有什么大事。”李纨又要说原故，尤氏反拦住了。林之孝家的见如此，只得便回身出园去。可巧遇见赵姨娘，因笑说：“嗳哟哟！我的嫂子！这会子还不家去歇歇，跑什么？”林之孝家的便笑说：“何曾没家去？”如此这般，“进来了。”赵姨娘便说：“这事也值一个屁！开恩呢，就不理论；心窄些儿，也不过打几下就完了，也值的叫你进来！你快歇歇去，我也不留你喝茶了。”\n　　说毕，林之孝家的出来。到了侧门前，就有才两个婆子的女儿上来哭着求情。林之孝家的笑道：“你这孩子好糊涂！谁叫他好喝酒、混说话？惹出事来，连我也不知道。二奶奶打发人捆他，连我还有不是呢，我替谁讨情去？”这两个小丫头子才十来岁，原不识事，只管啼哭求告。缠的林之孝家的没法，因说道：“糊涂东西，你放着门路不去求，尽着缠我。你姐姐现给了那边大太太的陪房费大娘的儿子，你过去告诉你姐姐，叫亲家娘和太太一说，什么完不了的？”一语提醒了这一个，那一个还求。林之孝家的哼道：“糊涂攮的！他过去一说，自然都完了。没有单放他妈又打你妈的理。”说毕上车去了。\n　　这一个小丫头子，果然过来告诉了他姐姐，和费婆子说了。这费婆子原是个大不安静的，便隔墙大骂一阵，走了来求邢夫人，说他亲家“与大奶奶的小丫头白斗了两句话，周瑞家的挑唆了二奶奶，现捆在马圈里，等过两日还要打呢。求太太和二奶奶说声，饶他一次罢”。邢夫人自为要鸳鸯讨了没意思，贾母冷淡了他，且前日南安太妃来，贾母又单令探春出来，自己心内早已怨忿。又有在侧一干小人，心内嫉妒，挟怨凤姐，便调唆的邢夫人着实憎恶凤姐。如今又听了如此一篇话，也不说长短。\n　　至次日一早，见过贾母。众族人到齐，开戏。贾母高兴，又今日都是自己族中子侄辈，只便妆出来堂上受礼。当中独设一榻，引枕、靠背、脚踏俱全，自己歪在榻上。榻之前后左右，皆是一色的矮凳。宝钗、宝琴、黛玉、湘云、迎春、探春、惜春姊妹等围绕。因贾之母也带了女儿喜鸾，贾琼之母也带了女儿四姐儿，还有几房的孙女儿，大小共有二十来个，贾母独见喜鸾、四姐儿生得又好，说话行事与众不同，心中欢喜，便叫他两个也坐在榻前。宝玉却在榻上，与贾母捶腿。首席便是薛姨妈，下边两溜顺着房头辈数下去。帘外两廊，都是族中男客，也依次而坐。先是那女客一起一起行礼，后是男客行礼。贾母歪在榻上，只命人说：“免了罢。”然后赖大等带领众家人，从仪门直跪至大厅上磕头。礼毕，又是众家下媳妇。然后各房丫鬟。足闹了两三顿饭时。然后又抬了许多雀笼来，在当院中放了生。贾赦等焚过天地寿星纸，方开戏饮酒。直到歇了中台，贾母方进来歇息，命他们取便，因命凤姐儿留下喜鸾、四姐儿玩两日再去。凤姐儿出来，便和他母亲说。他两个母亲素日承凤姐的照顾，愿意在园内玩笑，至晚便不回去了。\n　　邢夫人直至晚间散时，当着众人，陪笑和凤姐求情说：“我昨日晚上听见二奶奶生气，打发周管家的奶奶儿捆了两个老婆，可也不知犯了什么罪？论理我不该讨情，我想老太太好日子，发狠的还要舍钱舍米，周贫济老，咱们先倒挫磨起老奴才来了？就不看我的脸，权且看老太太，暂且竟放了他们罢。”说毕，上车去了。凤姐听了这话，又当着众人，又羞又气，一时找寻不着头脑，别的脸紫胀，回头向赖大家的等冷笑道：“这是那里的话？昨儿因为这里的人得罪了那府里大奶奶，我怕大奶奶多心，所以尽让他发放，并不为得罪了我。这又是谁的耳报神这么快？”王夫人因问：“为什么事？”凤姐儿笑将昨日的事说了。尤氏也笑道：“连我并不知道，你原也太多事了。”凤姐儿道：“我为你脸上过不去，所以等你开发，不过是个礼。就如我在你那里，有人得罪了我，你自然送了来尽我。凭他是什么好奴才，到底错不过这个礼去。这又不知谁过去，没的献勤儿，这也当作一件事情来说。”王夫人道：“你太太说的是。就是你珍大嫂子也不是外人，也不用这些虚礼。老太太的千秋要紧，放了他们为是。”说着，回头便命人去放了那两个婆子。凤姐由不得越想越气越愧，不觉的一阵心灰，落下泪来。因赌气回房哭泣，又不使人知觉；偏是贾母打发了琥珀来叫，立等说话。琥珀见了，诧异道：“好好的，这是什么原故？那里立等你呢。”凤姐听了，忙擦干了泪，洗面另施了脂粉，方同琥珀过来。\n　　贾母因问道：“前儿这些人家送礼来的，共有几家有围屏？”凤姐儿道：“共有十六家。有十二架大的，四架小的炕屏。内中只有甄家一架大屏，十二扇大红缎子刻丝‘满床笏’、一面泥金‘面寿图’的是头等。还有粤海将军邬家的一架玻璃的还罢了。”贾母道：“既这么样，这两架别动，好生搁着，我要送人的。”凤姐答应了。鸳鸯忽过来，向凤姐脸上细瞧。引的贾母问说：“你不认得他？只管瞧什么？”鸳鸯笑道：“我看他的眼肿肿的，所以我诧异。”贾母便叫“过来”，也细细的看。凤姐笑道：“才觉的发痒，揉肿了些。”鸳鸯笑道：“别又是受了谁的气了罢。”凤姐笑道：“谁敢给我气受？就受了气，老太太好日子，我也不敢哭啊。”贾母道：“正是呢。我正要吃饭，你在这里打发我吃，剩下的，你和珍儿媳妇吃了。你们两个在这里帮着师父们替我拣佛头儿，你们也积积寿。前儿你妹妹们和宝玉都拣了，如今也叫你们拣拣，别说我偏心。”说话时先摆上一桌素馔来，两个姑子吃。然后摆上荤的，贾母吃毕，抬出外间。尤氏凤姐二人正吃着，贾母又叫把喜鸾、四姐儿二人叫来，跟他二人吃毕，洗了手，点上香，捧上一升豆子来，两个姑子先念了佛偈，然后一个一个的拣在一个笸箩内，明日煮熟了，令人在十字街结寿缘。贾母歪着，听两个姑子说些因果。\n　　鸳鸯早已听见琥珀说凤姐哭之一事，又和平儿前打听得原故，晚间人散时，便回说：“二奶奶还是哭的，那边大太太当着人给二奶奶没脸。”贾母因问：“为什么原故？”鸳鸯便将原故说了。贾母道：“这才是凤丫头知礼处。难道为我的生日，由着奴才们把一族中的主子都得罪了，也不管罢？这是大太太素日没好气，不敢发作，所以今儿拿着这个作法，明是当着众人给凤姐儿没脸罢了。”正说着，只见宝琴来了，也就不说了。\n　　贾母忽想起留下的喜姐儿、四姐儿，叫人吩咐园中婆子们：“要和家里的姑娘一样照应。倘有人小看了他们，我听见可不饶。”婆子答应了，方要走时，鸳鸯道：“我说去罢。他们那里听他的话？”说着，便一径往园里来。先到稻香村中，李纨与尤氏都不在这里。问丫鬟们，都说：“在三姑娘那里呢。”鸳鸯回身，又来至晓翠堂，果见那园中人都在那里说笑。见他来了，都笑说：“你这会子又跑到这里做什么？”又让坐。鸳鸯笑道：“不许我逛逛么？”于是把方才的话说了一遍。李纨忙起身听了，即刻就叫人把各处的头儿唤了一个来，令他们传与诸人知道，不在话下。这里尤氏笑道：“老太太也太想的到。实在我们年轻力壮的人，捆上十个也赶不上。”李纨道：“凤丫头仗着鬼聪明，还离脚踪儿不远，咱们是不能的了。”鸳鸯道：“罢哟，还提‘凤丫头’‘虎丫头’呢。他的为人，也可怜见儿的。虽然这几年没有在老太太、太太跟前有个错缝儿，暗里也不知得罪了多少人。总而言之，为人是难做的，若太老实了，没有个机变，公婆又嫌太老实了，家里人也不怕；若有些机变，未免又‘治一经损一经’。如今咱们家更好，新出来的这些底下字号的奶奶们，一个个心满意足，都不知道要怎么样才好，少不得意，不是背地里嚼舌根，就是调三窝四的。我怕老太太生气，一点儿也不肯说，不然我告诉出来，大家别过太平日子。这不是我当着三姑娘说：老太太偏疼宝玉，有人背地怨言还罢了，算是偏心；如今老太太偏疼你，我听着也是不好。这可笑不可笑？”探春笑道：“糊涂人多，那里较量得许多？我说倒不如小户人家，虽然寒素些，倒是天天娘儿们欢天喜地，大家快乐。我们这样人家，人都看着我们不知千金万金、何等快乐，殊不知这里说不出来的烦难，更利害！\n　　宝玉道：“谁都象三妹妹多心多事？我常劝你总别听那些俗语、想那些俗事，只管安富尊荣才是，比不得我们，没这清福，应该混闹的。”尤氏道：“谁都象你是一心无挂碍，只知道和姊妹们玩笑，饿了吃，困了睡，再过几年，不过是这样，一点后事也不虑。”宝玉笑道：“我能够和姊妹们过一日，是一日，死了就完了，什么后事不后事。”李纨等都笑道：“这可又是胡说了。就算你是个没出息的，终老在这里，难道他姐儿们都不出门子罢？”尤氏笑道：“怨不得都说你空长了个好胎子，真真是个傻东西。”宝玉笑道：“人事难定，谁死谁活？倘或我在今日明日、今年明年死了，也算是随心一辈子了。”众人不等说完，便说：“越发胡说了！别和他说话才好。要和他说话，不是呆话，就是疯话。”喜鸾因笑道：“二哥哥，你别这么说，等这里姐姐们果然都出了门，横竖老太太、太太也闷的慌，我来和你作伴儿。”李纨、尤氏都笑道：“姑娘也别说呆话。难道你是不出门子的吗？”一句说的喜鸾也臊了，低了头。当下已起更时分，大家各自归房安歇，不提。\n　　且说鸳鸯一径回来，刚至园门前，只见角门虚掩，犹未上闩。此时园内无人来往，只有班儿房子里灯光掩映，微月半天。鸳鸯又不曾有伴，也不曾提灯，独自一个，脚步又轻，所以该班的人皆不理会。偏要小解，因下了甬路，找微草处走动，行至一块湘山石后大桂树底下来。刚转至石边，只听一阵衣衫响，吓了一惊不小。定睛看时，只见是两个人在那里，见他来了，便想往树丛石后藏躲。鸳鸯眼尖，趁着半明的月色，早看见一个穿红袄儿、梳头、高大丰壮身材的，是迎春房里司棋。鸳鸯只当他和别的女孩子也在此方便，见自己来了，故意藏躲，吓着玩耍，因便笑叫道：“司棋！你不快出来，吓着我，我就喊起来，当贼拿了。这么大丫头，也没个黑家白日，只是玩不够。”这本是鸳鸯戏语，叫他出来。谁知他贼人胆虚，只当鸳鸯已看见他的首尾了，生恐叫喊出来，使众人知觉，更不好；且素日鸳鸯又和自己亲厚，不比别人：便从树后跑出来，一把拉住鸳鸯，便双膝跪下，只说：“好姐姐！千万别嚷！”\n鸳鸯反不知他为什么，忙拉他起来，问道：“这是怎么说？”司棋只不言语，浑身乱颤。鸳鸯越发不解。再瞧了一瞧，又有一个人影儿，恍惚象是个小厮，心下便猜着了八九分，自己反羞的心跳耳热，又怕起来。固定了一会，忙悄问：“那一个是谁？”司棋又跪下道：“是我姑舅哥哥。”鸳鸯啐了一口，却羞的一句话也说不出来。司棋又回头悄叫道：“你不用藏着，姐姐已经看见了。快出来磕头。”那小厮听了，只得也从树后跑出来，磕头如捣蒜。鸳鸯忙要回身，司棋拉住苦求，哭道：“我们的性命都在姐姐身上，只求姐姐超生我们罢了！”鸳鸯道：“你不用多说了，快叫他去罢。横竖我不告诉人就是了。你这是怎么说呢！”一语未了，只听角门上有人说道：“金姑娘已经出去了，角门上锁罢。”鸳鸯正被司棋拉住，不得脱身，听见如此说，便忙着接声道：“我在这里有事，且略等等儿我出来了。”司棋听了，只得松手，让他去了。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "It so happened that two maids from the Lady Dowager’s apartments came hurrying frantically in search of Baoyu.\n\n“Come quickly, young master,” they cried. “The master’s back.”\n\nBaoyu was overjoyed yet also apprehensive. He changed his clothes hastily and went to pay his respects. Jia Zheng, who had not even changed his travelling clothes yet, was with his mother. He was pleased to see his son, though at the same time rather sad. After he had described his experiences during his tour of duty, the Lady Dowager told him:\n\n“You must be tired. Go and rest now.”\n\nJia Zheng rose to his feet and assented with a smile. After standing there a few moments longer and exchanging a few more words, he withdrew. Baoyu and the others followed him out. Jia Zheng then questioned Baoyu about his lessons and dismissed him.\n\nTo explain: Jia Zheng had returned to the capital to report the completion of his mission. As an Educational Commissioner he could not go home before an audience with the Emperor. So Jia Zhen, Jia Lian and Baoyu had gone the previous day to meet him at a post station. He had first inquired after his mother’s health, then ordered them to return home to wait on her. The next day, after his audience with the Emperor and the completion of all his business, he came home. He had been granted a month’s leave to rest. As he was growing old and found his duties arduous, and had been separated from his family for several years, he felt incomparably happy to be reunited with them at last. He put all affairs, big or small, out of his mind and simply read, or when bored played chess or drank with his proteges. Or else he stayed in the inner apartments to enjoy domestic bliss with his mother, wife and children.\n\nNow the third of the eighth month was the Lady Dowager’s eightieth birthday. As all their relatives and friends were bound to come to offer congratulations, it seemed likely that one mansion would not suffice for the feasts to be given. So Jia Zheng had held an early consultation with Jia She, Jia Lian and others, and it was decided that from the twenty-eighth of the seventh month to the fifth of the eighth, feasts should be given simultaneously in both mansions. In the Ning Mansion they would entertain male guests, in the Rong Mansion female guests. In the Garden, the Painted Mist Boat in the Palace of Imperial Favour and the Hall of Auspicious Shade were made ready as retiring-rooms. On the twenty-eighth they would invite the imperial clansmen, consorts of princesses, princes, dukes, marquises, imperial daughters, grand-daughters of emperors, generals, and ladies with official titles. On the twenty-ninth, military and civil officials with their wives and other ladies with official titles. On the thirtieth, other officials and their wives, relatives and friends. The first would be the day of Jia She’s family feast, the second of Jia Zheng’s, the third of Jia Zhen’s and Jia Lian’s, the fourth of the whole Jia clan, old and young; and the fifth, of Lai Da, Lin Zhixiao and other stewards with their wives.\n\nFrom the beginning of the seventh month, presents had been arriving in an endless stream. The Ministry of Rites, by the Emperor’s orders, presented a ruyi sceptre of gold and jade, four lengths of coloured satin, four gold and four jade cups, and five hundred taels of silver from the Imperial Treasury. Yuanchun sent eunuchs with a golden image of the God of Longevity, an aloeswood walking-stick, a string of chaplet-beads, a box of rare incense, a pair of gold ingots, four pairs of silver ingots, twelve rolls of satin and four jade cups. And all the princes, consorts of princesses, as well as civil and military officials high and low who had connections with the Jias, sent gifts too numerous to record. In the main hall was set a long table spread with red felt, on which were displayed all the most valuable gifts for the Lady Dowager’s inspection. The first couple of days she was pleased to look them over, but after that she found this a nuisance and simply said:\n\n“Take them away and show them to me some other day when I have time.”\n\nBy the twenty-eighth, both mansions were hung with lanterns and decorated with streamers. Phoenix screens and lotus-patterned carpets had been placed in all the rooms, and the strains of music could be heard in the streets and lanes outside. That day the guests in the Ning Mansion were the Prince of Beijing, the Prince of Nanan, the Consort of Yongchang, the Prince of Leshan and some hereditary dukes and marquises who were family friends. In the Rong Mansion were the Princess of Nanan, the Princess Consort of Beijing and ladies with titles from families related or friendly to the Jias. The Lady Dowager and others had ceremonial costumes and received the guests according to their rank. After the first greetings, the company was invited into the Garden to the Hall of Auspicious Shade, where they were served tea and could change their clothes before going to the Hall of Glorious Celebration in the Rong Mansion to offer their congratulations and take their seats at the feast. After much polite demurring they at last sat down.\n\nThe Princesses of the Southern and Northern Principalities sat next, and below them the wives of dukes and marquises in order of precedence. On the left the first seats were occupied by the wives of the Marquis of Jinxiang and the Earl of Linchang. On the right the place of honour was given to the Lady Dowager, with Lady Xing and Lady Wang behind her, as well as Madam You and Xifeng and some other married women of the clan, who stood in two rows like wild geese with outspread wings. Lin Zhixiao’s wife and Lai Da’s wife headed the other serving-women outside the bamboo portiere, who were ready to bring in the dishes and wine, while Zhou Rui’s wife headed some maids behind the screen who were waiting to be called. All the servants who had accompanied the visitors were feasted elsewhere.\n\nSoon the players entered to pay their respects. Below the stage a dozen little actresses not yet with their hair done up, dressed like pages, were waiting in attendance with lowered heads. Presently one of them came up the steps with the play-list and handed it to the chief serving-woman, who passed it on to Lin Zhixiao’s wife. She carried it in on a small tea-tray, slipping inside the portiere to give it to Peifeng, one of Madam You’s concubines. Peifeng in turn handed it to Madam You, who carried it to the seat of honour. The Princess of Nanan after a show of declining chose an auspicious item, then passed the list to the Princess of Beijing, who also chose one. When the others had all demurred, they were begged to choose any good play they fancied.\n\nBy the time four courses had been served and the first soup, the servants of the different families had tipped the actors. Then their mistresses changed their clothes and came into the garden, where a different kind of tea was served. The Princess of Nanan asked to see Baoyu.\n\n“He’s gone to a temple today where they’re chanting sutras to ensure longevity and ward off evil,” the Lady Dowager told her. “He had to kneel in prayer there.”\n\nAsked to see the young ladies, she replied, “As they’re either ailing or too delicate and bashful to appear in company, I’ve told them to keep an eye on things for me in my apartments. We have a company of young actresses performing in one of the halls there, so they’re keeping my granddaughter-in-law’s sisters company and watching the plays.”\n\n“In that case, do send to fetch them,” said the princess.\n\nThe Lady Dowager turned to order Xifeng to bring the four girls: Xiangyun, Baochai, Daiyu and Baoqin, as well as Tanchun. Xifeng assented and went off. She found the girls eating melon-seeds as they watched the performance, and Baoyu had just come back from the temple. At Xifeng’s message, the five of them went to the garden. They paid their respects to all the guests, some of whom they had met before while others were strangers. All present was loud in their praise, and Xiangyun who was known to the Princess of Nanan was scolded laughingly, “So you were here! When you heard I’d come, why didn’t you come to greet me without waiting to be sent for? I shall have to tell your uncle to take you to task.”\n\nShe took Tanchun and Baochai each by the hand and asked how old they were. When they told her she exclaimed in admiration, then let go of them to take Daiyu and Baoqin’s hands and subject them to a long, close scrutiny.\n\n“They’re all so charming, I really don’t know which to praise most,” she declared with a smile.\n\nMeanwhile some maids had brought five presents ready wrapped: five gold rings and five bracelets of scented beads.\n\n“Don’t laugh at these, girls,” said the princess. “Just keep them to give your maids.”\n\nThe five girls curtseyed their thanks. The Princess of Beijing had five gifts too, but we need not enumerate them.\n\nAfter tea, when they had strolled through part of the garden, the Lady Dowager invited her guests to take seats again. But the Princess of Nanan rose to take her leave.\n\n“I’m not feeling well,” she said. “But I couldn’t disappoint you by not coming. I hope you’ll excuse me if I leave now.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the others did not press her to stay. After seeing her to the gate of the garden they watched her get into her sedan-chair and depart. The Princess of Beijing did not stay long either but soon took her leave as well. Some of the other guests stayed to the end, some left earlier. The Lady Dowager, tired out by the day’s exertions, did not receive any visitors the next day but left it to Lady Xing to entertain those who came. Young scions of noble houses who came to offer congratulations were received by the men in the front hall.\n\nJia She, Jia Zheng and Jia Zhen returned the greetings, then went to the Ning Mansion to feast. Of this no more need be said.\n\nDuring these days Madam You did not go back to the other mansion but stayed in the daytime to entertain the ladies, in the evening to amuse the Lady Dowager, and also to help Xifeng with the management of the large and small utensils and the receiving and storing away of gifts. At night she slept in Li Wan’s room in the Garden.\n\nOne day, having waited on the Lady Dowager during her meal, Madam You was told, “You must be tired, and I am too. Why not have a bite to eat now and rest early? We have to get up early tomorrow.”\n\nMadam You assented and withdrew to have a meal in Xifeng’s apartments. Xifeng herself was upstairs supervising the storing of the gift screens, and only Pinger was in her room folding clothes. The sight of Pinger reminded Madam You how good the girl had been to Second Sister, and she nodded at her.\n\n“You’re a good soul, child,” she said. “It can’t be easy for you, having to put up with so much here.”\n\nPinger’s eyes reddened, but she hastily changed the subject.\n\n“Is your mistress in to dinner?” asked Madam You.\n\n“If it’s time for dinner, of course I must ask her to come,” replied Pinger.\n\n“In that case, I’ll go somewhere else to find something to eat. I’m absolutely famished.” With that she started out.\n\n“Do come back, madam!” Pinger called after her. “There are some steamed buns here. Have one to stay your hunger, then you can have a proper meal later.”\n\n“No, you’re busy. I’ll go to the Garden and have some fun with the girls.”\n\nPinger could not detain her.\n\nMadam You went on then to the Garden. She found the main gate and the side gates still open and all the coloured lanterns still hanging. Turning back, she ordered a young maid to fetch the women on duty. The maid went to their lodge but found it deserted. When she reported this, Madam You told her to fetch the stewards’ wives. The maid assented and went to the inner gate-house where the stewards’ wives met to discuss business. There she found only two old women dividing fruit and dishes.\n\n“Which stewards’ wives are here?” she asked. “The mistress from the East Mansion is waiting to see one of them to give some instructions.”\n\nThe two women went on dividing the fruit, not much impressed by the message from the East Mansion.\n\n“The stewards’ wives have just dispersed,” they replied.\n\n“If they’ve dispersed, go and fetch one of them from her home.”\n\n“We’re only in charge here, not sent to fetch people. If you want someone fetched, send a messenger.”\n\n“A fine way to talk!” retorted the maid. “Why won’t you go? You may be able to fool newcomers, but not me. If you don’t fetch them, who will? When you hear some bit of news, or that some steward’s wife has been given a tip, you go rushing over to announce it, brown-nosing like crazy. Don’t think I don’t know you! If this message were from Madam Lian, would you dare answer back?”\n\nThe women, half tipsy and stung by her taunt, lost their temper.\n\n“Shut your foul mouth!” one cried. “Whether we go or not is none of your business. You’ve no call to sneer at us. Just think: your parents are even bigger toadies to the stewards. Clear off! If you’ve the nerve, you can throw your weight about on your own side. But you’ve no jurisdiction here.”\n\nThe maid was white with rage.\n\n“Fine, just wait!” she fumed, and turned to go back to report this.\n\nBut Madam You had already entered the Garden, where she happened to meet Xiren, Baoqin and Xiangyun with two nuns from the Ksitigarbha Nunnery who were telling them stories for fun. Madam You said she was hungry, so they went to Happy Red Court, where Xiren produced some meat and vegetarian dishes for her.\n\nThe young maid went off to find them and came back in high dudgeon to report what they had said.\n\nAfter a pause Madam You observed with a cold laugh, “Who do they think they are?”\n\nThe two nuns laughingly remonstrated with the maid, “You’re a choleric young lady, aren’t you? You shouldn’t have reported such nonsense from those stupid old women. Our lady’s health is precious, and she must be tired after several days’ hard work with nothing much to eat. We should be cheering her up, not provoking her with such silly tales.”\n\nXiren smilingly drew the maid out, saying, “Come on, sister, you go and have a rest. I’ll send to have them called.”\n\n“Don’t send anyone,” said Madam You. “Go and fetch those two women yourself, then go over to the other house and ask for Xifeng.”\n\n“I’ll go and invite her,” offered Xiren.\n\n“No, I don’t want you to,” snapped Madam You.\n\nThe two nuns had risen to their feet.\n\n“You’re always so broad-minded,” they said. “If you lose your temper today, the Old Ancestress’s birthday, people are bound to talk.”\n\nBaoqin and Xiangyun added their pleas.\n\n“If not for the Old Ancestress’ birthday, I wouldn’t let them off,” said Madam You. “But I’ll leave it at that for the time being.”\n\nMeanwhile Xiren had sent another maid to the Garden gate to fetch the women. As luck would have it, she met Zhou Rui’s wife there and told her the whole story. Although not in charge, this woman had some standing as one of Lady Wang’s personal attendants. A sly, artful creature, she made a point of currying favour everywhere so that all the mistresses liked her. Having heard this account she hurried to Happy Red Court.\n\n“A fine to-do!” she cried as she ran. “The mistress is furious. Pity I wasn’t there — I’d have boxed their ears and settled accounts with them after this birthday.” At sight of her Madam You smiled.\n\n“Come here, sister,” she said. “I want your opinion. It’s late, but the Garden gate is still wide open and all the lanterns are lit. With so many people coming and going, if anything should happen how could we answer for it? So I told the women on duty to put out the lights and close the gate. But not a soul was there!”\n\n“This is monstrous!” exclaimed Zhou Rui’s wife. “The other day Madam Lian gave orders, yet today there’s no one here. After this we must give some of them a good beating.”\n\nWhen Madam You told her what the maid had reported, she said, “Don’t be angry, madam. After this is over I’ll report to the stewards and have them beaten within an inch of their lives. We’ll find out who talked about ‘each household minding its own business.’ I’ve already told them to put out the lights and lock the gate. Please calm down, madam.”\n\nIn the midst of this confusion Xifeng sent to invite Madam You to supper.\n\n“I’m not hungry,” was the answer. “I’ve just had some cakes. Please ask your mistress to start without me.”\n\nPresently Zhou Rui’s wife left and reported this incident to Xifeng, who ordered, “Have those two women’s names taken down. After the birthday celebrations, have them trussed up and sent to the other house for Madam You to deal with — she can have them beaten or let off, whichever she prefers. What a fuss about nothing!”\n\nThis was just what Zhou Rui’s wife wanted to hear. As she had a grudge against those women, she sent a page at once to inform Lin Zhixiao’s wife of Xifeng’s orders and to have her come to see Madam You immediately. She also sent to have the two women tied up and confined in the stables, with men to guard them.\n\nNot knowing what this was about, Lin Zhixiao’s wife hurried there by carriage and called first on Xifeng. But when she sent in her name, maids came out to say, “Madam Lian has just gone to bed. As Madam You is in the Garden, you’d better go to see her, ma’am.”\n\nSo Mrs. Lin had to go into the Garden to Paddy-Sweet Cottage. When the maids announced her, Madam You felt rather embarrassed and had her admitted at once.\n\nShe went up to her with a smile. “I was looking for someone, and as I couldn’t find her I asked for you. Since you’d already left, it wasn’t important; but who sent to fetch you back? I’m afraid you had a wasted journey. It was nothing, and I’ve already dropped the matter.”\n\nMrs. Lin smiled back. “Your Ladyship sent to say you had some orders for me.”\n\n“I expect it was on Sister Chou’s account. You may go home now and rest. It was nothing important.”\n\nLi Wan was about to explain, but Madam Yu stopped her. Seeing this, Mrs. Lin had to turn and leave the Garden. She happened to meet Concubine Chao on the way.\n\n“Aiya, sister!” cried the concubine. “Aren’t you home yet? Why are you rushing about instead of resting?”\n\n“I did go home,” Mrs. Lin told her what had happened.\n\n“That business? It’s not worth a fart! If they’re kind, they’ll overlook it; if they’re mean, they’ll give them a few strokes — that’s all. It wasn’t worth sending for you. Go and rest now. I won’t keep you for tea.”\n\nWith that Mrs. Lin left and had reached the side gate when the two serving-women’s daughters accosted her, crying and begging her to help.\n\n“Silly children!” she scolded. “Who told them to drink and talk wildly? They got themselves into this scrape without my knowing. Her Ladyship has given orders to have them trussed up, and if I’m not careful I shall get the blame too. How can I plead for them?”\n\nThe two young maids, who were only about ten and too young to know better, simply went on crying and pleading until Mrs. Lin lost patience.\n\n“Don’t pester me, you stupid things,” she said. “There’s a way out but you won’t take it. Your sister’s married to the son of Mrs. Fei, who came here as Lady Hsing’s dowry attendant. Go and tell your sister to ask her mother-in-law to put in a word with Her Ladyship, and that will settle the whole business.”\n\nThis reminded one of the girls, but the other went on pleading.\n\n“Stupid creature!” snorted Mrs. Lin. “If she speaks to Lady Hsing, that should do the trick. They can’t very well let her mother off but beat yours.”\n\nThen she got into her carriage and drove off.\n\nOne of the girls went to tell her sister, who spoke to Mrs. Fei. And Mrs. Fei, a troublesome woman, first swore for some time on the other side of the wall, then went to ask an audience with Lady Hsing.\n\n“My daughter’s mother-in-law exchanged a few words with the elder mistress’ maid,” she said, “and Mrs. Chou egged Her Ladyship on to have her trussed up in the stables. In a couple of days she’s to be given a beating. I beg you, madam, to have a word with Her Ladyship and ask her to let the woman off.”\n\nLady Hsing had been snubbed by the Lady Dowager over Yuanyang and felt that the old lady was cold to her. Then the other day, when the Princess of Nanan called, the Lady Dowager had sent for Tanchun only to help entertain her, which had made Lady Hsing resentful. And the spiteful people around her, who were jealous of Xifeng, had been inciting her against her daughter-in-law. So this request made her hate Xifeng even more, though she refrained from comment.\n\nThe next day, after calling on the Lady Dowager, she watched the operas with the whole clan. Because the old lady was in high spirits and all the young people present were her own grandchildren, she did not dress formally but received their birthday greetings in the hall, reclining on a couch which was completely equipped with back-rest, bolster and footstool. In front and at the sides of the couch were low stools on which sat Pao-chai, Pao-chin, Tai-yu, Hsiang-yun, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Hsi-chun. And because Chia Shu’s mother had brought her daughter Hsi-luan, and Chia Chiang’s mother her daughter Ssu-chieh, there were more than twenty girls there in all, granddaughters of different branches of the family. The Lady Dowager was taken with Hsi-luan and Ssu-chieh, who were good-looking and better-behaved than the rest, and she made them sit beside her couch while Pao-yu massaged her legs. Aunt Hsueh had the seat of honour, and below her the others sat in two rows.\n\nAfter this they were arranged by households in order of seniority, while in the corridors outside the portiere the men of the clan took their seats also in due order. First the women in groups paid their respects, then the men. The Lady Dowager lay back on her couch and simply told the servants to excuse them from this ceremony. After that Lai Da and the other stewards led the male and female servants of the household to kneel in the ceremonial gate and pay their respects in the main hall. This was followed by the married maids and then by the maids of the different apartments. This took the time of two or three meals. Then many cages of birds were carried into the courtyard and set free. And not until Jia She and the other men had burned paper sacrifices to Heaven and Earth and the God of Longevity did the opera begin, followed by a feast. Not until the interval at noon did the Lady Dowager go to her own quarters to rest, telling the others to enjoy themselves as they pleased. She asked Xifeng to keep Xiluan and Sijie for a couple of days’ fun, and Xifeng went out to pass on this invitation to their mothers. As these two women were beholden to her for past favours, they were only too glad to leave their daughters there; and not until that evening did they go home.\n\nThat evening, when the party broke up, Lady Xing chose a moment when many people were present to put in a good word for the two old women who had been tied up.\n\n“Yesterday evening I heard that the Second Mistress was angry and had the wives of the stewards Zhou and Wu tie up two old serving-women,” she said with a smile. “I’ve no idea what fault they committed, and of course it’s not my place to ask pardon for them; but as this is the old lady’s birthday, when we should be doing our best to give alms to the poor and old, it seems a pity to start by punishing old servants. If not for my sake, at least for the old lady’s, won’t you let them off?”\n\nWith that she got into her carriage and left.\n\nXifeng, put to shame in public by this request, was both mortified and angry. At a loss for an answer, she flushed purple and turned to glare at Lai Da’s wife.\n\n“What’s this about?” she demanded. “Because some of our people offended the mistress of the other house yesterday, and I was afraid she might take offence, I left it to her to punish them — it wasn’t because they’d offended me. Who’s been telling such tales so fast?”\n\nLady Wang asked what had happened, and Xifeng described the previous day’s incident.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about it,” put in Madam You with a smile. “You’re really too touchy.”\n\n“I was thinking of your dignity, that’s why I waited for you to deal with them — that was only right and proper,” Xifeng told her. “If I were in your place and someone offended me, you’d naturally send her to me for punishment. No matter how good a servant she is, she can’t ignore protocol. I’d like to know who butted in to make trouble, treating this as something important.”\n\n“Your mother-in-law is right,” said Lady Wang. “And your sister-in-law Zhen isn’t an outsider either, there’s no call for such empty formalities with her. The old lady’s birthday is what matters. You’d better let those women off.”\n\nShe turned and ordered their release.\n\nXifeng, more mortified than ever, could not hold back her tears. But not wanting others to see, she went back to her room in a fit of pique to cry by herself. And just then the Lady Dowager sent Hupo to fetch her, saying she was waiting to speak to her. Hupo was surprised to see Xifeng in tears.\n\n“What’s wrong?” she asked. “The old lady’s waiting for you.”\n\nXifeng hastily dried her tears, washed her face and made up again, then went over with Hupo.\n\n“How many of the families who sent birthday presents the other day sent folding-screens?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Sixteen families,” replied Xifeng. “There were twelve large screens and four small kang-screens. The best of them is that twelve-fold screen of kesi 1 silk from the Zhen family, with a design of court officials in scarlet satin and a longevity pattern in gilt. Then there’s a glass screen from the family of General Wu of Guangdong which isn’t bad either.”\n\n“In that case, don’t use those two. Put them away carefully now. I mean to give them to someone.”\n\nXifeng assented.\n\nJust then Yuanyang came over to peer at Xifeng’s face.\n\n“Do you mean to say you don’t know her?” asked the Lady Dowager. “What are you staring at her for?”\n\n“I was wondering why her eyes are so swollen,” Yuanyang answered with a smile.\n\nNoticing that her eyes were swollen, the Lady Dowager called for her and examined her carefully.\n\n“They were itching, so I rubbed them and made them swollen,” Xifeng explained.\n\n“I suppose someone’s been upsetting you again?” quipped Yuanyang.\n\n“Who would dare? But even if they did, how could I dare cry on the old lady’s birthday?”\n\n“Quite right,” agreed the Lady Dowager. “I’m going to have my meal now, so you can wait on me and then eat what’s left with Zhen’s wife. You can both help the nuns sort out the beans for me as well, to gain some merit for yourselves. The other day the girls and Baoyu did this, so now it’s your turn. Don’t say I’m partial.”\n\nAs she was speaking a vegetarian meal was served for the two nuns. Then non-vegetarian dishes were brought for the Lady Dowager, and after she had finished the remains were taken to the outer room for Madam You and Xifeng. The Lady Dowager also sent to invite Xiluan and Sijie to eat with them. When the two girls had finished and washed their hands, incense was lit and a peck of beans was brought in. The two nuns recited some Buddhist charms, then the beans were sorted one by one into a basket to be cooked the next day and distributed at the crossroads to gain longevity. The Lady Dowager, reclining on her couch, listened to the nuns telling stories about the working of cause and effect.\n\nYuanyang, having heard from Hupo that Xifeng had been in tears and found out the reason from Pinger, reported this to the Lady Dowager that evening when the others had left.\n\n“Madam Lian was crying,” she said, “because the elder mistress insulted her in public.”\n\nAsked to explain, Yuanyang told her the whole story.\n\n“That shows Xifeng’s good sense,” said the Lady Dowager. “Do you suppose I’d have wanted her, for the sake of my birthday, to let servants offend all the mistresses of our house? The elder mistress has been in a bad mood for some time, but not vented it. Today she found this pretext to show up Xifeng in public, that’s all.”\n\nJust then Baoqin arrived and they dropped the subject.\n\nThe Lady Dowager, suddenly remembering Xijie and Sijie, sent to warn the matrons in the Garden to treat them like the young ladies of the house.\n\n“If I hear that anyone slights them, I won’t let her off,” she said.\n\nWhen the matron had assented and was about to leave, Yuanyang volunteered, “Let me go to tell them. They may not take any notice of her.”\n\nShe went straight to the Garden and first called at Paddy-Sweet Cottage, but Li Wan and Madam You were not there. The maids told her, “They’re with Miss Tanchun.” So Yuanyang turned back to Morning Emerald Hall, and sure enough found the whole household there chatting together.\n\n“What brings you here again?” they asked. And they offered her a seat.\n\n“Can’t I come to enjoy myself too?” she retorted.\n\nThen she passed on the Lady Dowager’s instructions. Li Wan rose to hear them and promptly sent to summon the chief matrons from different places, ordering them to pass this on to all their subordinates. Of this no more need be said.\n\n“The old lady thinks of everything,” remarked Madam You. “We young people can’t hold a candle to her, not ten of us put together.”\n\n“With her devilish cleverness, Xifeng is almost her match,” said Li Wan. “But we others are simply not in the running.”\n\n“Don’t talk about Xifeng or anyone else,” said Yuanyang. “She’s rather a pathetic creature. Although these last few years she’s never put a foot wrong in front of the old lady and Lady Wang, without knowing it she’s offended ever so many people. To sum up, it’s hard to be a human being. If you’re too honest, you lack wit and your parents-in-law don’t think much of you, while your own family don’t respect you either. If you have some wit, that may mean solving one problem only to create another. And now that our family’s going down in the world, these new young mistresses...”\n\nPerfectly content, she feels at a loss. Dissatisfied, she will either gossip behind people’s backs or make trouble. I was afraid of vexing the old lady, so I kept quiet; otherwise I’d have spoken out and put a stop to all this peace and quiet. I’m not saying this, Third Young Mistress, just because you’re here, but when the old lady favoured Pao-yu and people complained behind her back, that was understandable — after all she was partial to him. But now that she shows you special favour, I hear complaints too — isn’t that ridiculous?”\n\n“There are so many stupid people, how can you pay attention to them all?” countered Tan-chun. “Small families may be poor, but at least mothers and daughters are happy together all the time. A family like ours may appear to outsiders fabulously wealthy and happy, yet we have indescribable troubles and difficulties here which are even worse.”\n\n“Not everyone is as oversensitive and meddlesome as you, third sister,” said Pao-yu. “I’ve often advised you not to believe those vulgar sayings or bother your head about such vulgar matters. Just enjoy your peace, wealth and honour. You’re not like me, unable to enjoy a quiet life but fated to fool around.”\n\n“Who is as carefree as you?” asked Madam Yu. “All you do is have fun with the girls, eating when you’re hungry and sleeping when you’re tired. In a few years you’ll still be the same, without a thought for the future.”\n\n“So long as I can spend my time with my sisters, that’s all I want,” he rejoined. “When I die, that will be the end of it. What future should I worry about?”\n\n“There you go talking nonsense again,” cried Li Wan and the others. “Even if you’re good-for-nothing and stay here all your life, do you expect your sisters to stay at home too and not marry?”\n\n“No wonder everyone says you’ve a handsome face but a fool’s heart,” teased Madan Yu.\n\n“You never can tell in this life who will die first,” he retorted. “If I die today or tomorrow, this year or next, I shall have had my wish all my life.”\n\nBefore he could say more the others interposed, “This is more and more crazy. Better not talk to him. If you do, he comes out with some foolish nonsense or crazy talk.”\n\nHis-luan put in, “Don’t talk like that, Cousin Pao-yu. After the girls here have married and left, if the old lady and Lady Wang are too lonely I’ll come to keep you company.”\n\n“Don’t you talk nonsense too, miss,” cried Li Wan and Madam Yu. “Do you expect to stay at home and not marry either?”\n\nThis made His-luan blush and hang her head.\n\nBy now the first watch had sounded and they all went back to their own rooms to sleep.\n\nLet us return to Yuan-yang. She had walked straight back to the Garden gate, which was ajar but not yet bolted. There was no one about in the Garden now, and only the lamp in the watch-room shed a little light, the crescent moon having sunk in the sky. Yuan-yang had no companion and was not carrying a lantern. She walked so softly that the women on duty did not hear her. Having to relieve herself, she left the path to find some thick grass, and behind a large osmanthus tree at the side of a rock she suddenly heard the rustle of clothes, which gave her quite a start. Peering through the gloom, she made out two people who at sight of her dodged behind the rock. But Yuan-yang’s sharp eyes had recognized the tall, sturdy girl in a red silk jacket with her hair done up — it was Ssu-chi from Ying-chun’s apartments. Assuming that she had been relieving herself there too with some other maid and was hiding for fun to frighten her, Yuan-yang called out laughingly:\n\n“Ssu-chi, if you don’t come out quickly and scare me, I’ll shout and have you arrested as a thief. A great girl like you, still playing the same old games night and day!”\n\nThis was said in joke to make her come out. But the guilty pair, taking this for a hint that they had been discovered, were afraid she would really raise a hue and cry.\n\nPerception would be even worse. Besides, Yuanyang had always been on good terms with her, unlike the other girls. So she darted out from behind the tree and seized Yuanyang’s hand, then fell on her knees.\n\n“Dear sister, for pity’s sake don’t tell on us!” she begged.\n\nYuanyang, not knowing what she meant, quickly helped her up and asked, “What’s this about?”\n\nSiqi was trembling too much to answer. More mystified than ever, Yuanyang noticed another shadowy figure who looked like a young boy, and she guessed pretty well what had happened. She felt so embarrassed, her heart beat fast and her ears burned. She was frightened too, and for a while she stood stock-still. Then she asked softly:\n\n“Who’s that?”\n\nSiqi fell on her knees again.\n\n“My cousin,” she whispered.\n\nYuanyang spat in disgust, too overcome to say a word.\n\nSiqi turned her head to urge softly, “No use hiding. My sister’s seen you. Come out quickly and kowtow to her.”\n\nThen the boy had to dart out from behind the tree too and kowtow like a pestle pounding onions.\n\nAs Yuanyang turned to go, Siqi caught hold of her and implored her bitterly.\n\n“Our lives are in your hands, sister,” she wept. “Do have pity on us!”\n\n“Don’t worry,” said Yuanyang. “Just hurry him away. I promise not to tell anyone. What a way to behave!”\n\nBefore she had finished they heard someone at the side gate call, “Miss Yuanyang’s gone out. Lock the gate.”\n\nAs Siqi was still holding her, Yuanyang could not get away. She answered at once, “I’m here. Wait till I come out.”\n\nThen Siqi had to let her go.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
