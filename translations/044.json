  "original": "话说宝玉和姐妹一处坐着，同众人看演《荆钗记》，黛玉因看到《男祭》这出上，便和宝钗说道：“这王十朋也不通的很，不管在那里祭一祭罢了，必定跑到江边上来做什么，俗语说：‘睹物思人’，天下的水总归一源，不拘那里的水舀一碗，看着哭去，也就尽情了。”宝钗不答。宝玉听了，却又发起呆来。\n　　且说贾母心想，今日不比往日，定要教凤姐痛乐一日。本自己懒怠坐席，只在里间屋里榻上歪着和薛姨妈看戏，随心爱吃的拣几样放在小几上，随意吃着说话儿。将自己两桌席面，赏那没有席面的大小丫头并那应着差的妇人等，命他们在窗外廊檐下，也只管坐着随意吃喝，不必拘礼。王夫人和邢夫人在地下高桌上坐着，外面几席是他们姐妹们坐。贾母不时吩咐尤氏等，“让凤丫头坐上面，你们好生替我待东，难为他一年到头辛苦。”尤氏答应了，又笑回道：“他说坐不惯首席，坐在上头，横不是竖不是的，酒也不肯喝。”贾母听了．笑道：“你不会，等我亲自让他去。”凤姐儿忙也进来笑说：“老祖宗别信他们的话。我喝了好几钟了。”贾母笑着，命尤氏等：“拉他出去，按在椅子上，你们都轮流敬他。他再不吃，我当真的就亲自去了。”尤氏听说，忙笑着又拉他出来坐下，命人拿了台盏斟了酒，笑道：“一年到头，难为孝顺老太太、太太和我。我今儿没什么疼你的，亲自斟酒。我的乖乖，你在我手里喝一口罢。”凤姐儿笑道：“你要安心孝敬我，跪下，我就喝。”尤氏笑道：“说的你不知是谁！我告诉你说罢，好容易今儿这一遭，过了后儿，知道还得象今儿这样的不得了？趁着尽力灌两钟子罢。”凤姐儿见推不过，只得喝了两钟。\n　　接着众姐妹也来，凤姐也只得每人的喝了两口，赖嬷嬷见贾母尚且这等高兴，也少不得来凑趣儿，领着些嬷嬷们也来敬酒。凤姐儿也难推脱，只得喝了两口。鸳鸯等也都来敬，凤姐儿真不能了，忙央告道：“好姐姐们饶了我罢！我明儿再喝罢。”鸳鸯笑道：“真个的，我们是没脸的了？就是我们在太太跟前，太太还赏个脸儿呢。往常倒有些体面，今儿当着这些人，倒做起主子的款儿来了。我原不该来，不喝，我们就走。”说着真个回去了。凤姐儿忙忙拉住，笑道：“好姐姐，我喝就是了。”说着拿过酒来，满满的斟了一杯喝干，鸳鸯方笑了散去。\n　　然后又入席，凤姐儿自觉酒沉了，心里突突的往上撞，要往家去歇歇。只见那耍百戏的上来，便和尤氏说：“预备赏钱，我要洗洗脸去。”尤氏点头。凤姐儿瞅人不防，便出了席，往房门后檐下走来。平儿留心，也忙跟了来，凤姐便扶着他。才至穿廊下，只见他屋里的一个小丫头子正在那里站着，见他两个来了，回身就跑。凤姐儿便疑心，忙叫：那丫头先只装听不见，无奈后面连声儿叫，也只得回来。凤姐儿越发起了疑心，忙和平儿进了穿廊。叫那小丫头子也进来，把格扇开了，凤姐坐在当院子的台阶上，命那丫头子跪下，喝命平儿：“叫两个二门上的小厮来，拿绳子鞭子，把眼睛里没主子的小蹄子打烂了！”那小丫头子已经吓的魂飞魄散，哭着只管碰头求饶。凤姐儿问道：“我又不是鬼，你见了我，不识规矩站住，怎么倒往前跑？”小丫头子哭道：“我原没看见奶奶来，我又惦记着屋里没人，才跑来着。”凤姐儿道：“屋里既没人．谁叫你来的？你就没看见，我和平儿在后头扯着脖子叫了你十来声，越叫越跑。离的又不远，你聋了吗？你还和我强嘴！”说着，扬手一巴掌打在脸上，打的那小丫头子一栽，这边脸上又一下，登时小丫头子两腮紫胀起来。平儿忙劝：“奶奶仔细手疼。”凤姐便说：“你再打着问他跑什么。他再不说，把嘴撕烂了他的！”那小丫头子先还强嘴，后来听见凤姐儿要烧了红烙铁来烙嘴，方哭道：“二爷在家里，打发我来这里瞧着奶奶，要见奶奶散了，先叫我送信儿去呢。不承望奶奶这会子就来了。”凤姐儿见话里有文章，便又问道：“叫你瞧着我做什么？难道不叫我家去吗？必有别的原故，快告诉我，我从此以后疼你。你要不实说，立刻拿刀子来割你的肉！”说着，回头向头上拔下一根簪子来，向那丫头嘴上乱戳。吓的那丫头一行躲一行哭求，道：“我告诉奶奶，可别说我说的。”平儿一旁劝，一面催他叫他快说。丫头便说道：“二爷也是才来，来了就开箱子，拿了两块银子，还有两支簪子、两匹缎子．叫我悄悄的送与鲍二的老婆去，叫他进来。他收了东西，就往咱们屋里来了。二爷叫我瞧着奶奶。底下的事，我就不知道了。”\n　　凤姐听了，已气的浑身发软，忙立起身来，一径来家。刚至院门，只见有一个小丫头在门前探头儿，一见了凤姐也缩头就跑。凤姐儿提着名字喝住，那丫头本来伶俐，见躲不过了，越发的跑出来了，笑道：“我正要告诉奶奶去呢，可巧奶奶来了。”凤姐道：“告诉我什么？”那丫头便说：“二爷在家……”这般如此，将方才的话也说了一遍。凤姐啐道：“你早做什么了？这会子我看见你了，你来推干净儿！”说着，扬手一下，打的那丫头一个趔趄，便蹑脚儿走了。\n　　凤姐来至窗前，往里听时，只听里头说笑道：“多早晚你那阎王老婆死了就好了。”贾琏道：“他死了，再娶一个也这么着，又怎么样呢？”那个又道：“他死了，你倒是把平儿扶了正，只怕还好些。”贾琏道：“如今连平儿他也不叫我沾一沾了。平儿也是一肚子委屈，不敢说。我命里怎么就该犯了夜叉星！”凤姐听了，气的浑身乱战，又听他们都赞平儿，便疑平儿素日背地里自然也有怨言了，那酒越发涌上来了。也并不忖夺，回身把平儿先打了两下子。一脚踢开了门，进去也不容分说，抓着鲍二家的就撕打。又怕贾琏走了，堵着门站着骂：“好娼妇！你偷主子汉子，还要治死主子老婆！平儿过来，你们娼妇们一条藤儿，多嫌着我，外面儿你哄我！”说着，又把平儿打了几下。打的平儿有冤无处诉，只气得干哭。骂道：“你们做这些没脸事，好好的又拉上我做什么！”说着，也把鲍二家的撕打起来。\n　　贾琏也因吃多了酒，进来高兴，不曾做的机密，一见凤姐来了，早没了主意。又见平儿也闹起来，把酒也气上来了。凤姐儿打鲍二家的，他已又气又愧，只不好说的，今见平儿也打，便上来踢骂道：“好娼妇，你也动手打人！”平儿气怯，忙住了手，哭道：“你们背地里说话，为什么拉我呢？”凤姐见平儿怕贾琏，越发气了，又赶上来打着平儿，偏叫打鲍二家的。平儿急了，便跑出来找刀子要寻死。外面众婆子丫头忙拦住解劝。这里凤姐见平儿寻死去，便一头撞在贾琏怀里，叫道：“他们一条藤儿害我，被我听见，倒都唬起我来，你来勒死我罢！”贾琏气的墙上拔出剑来，说道：“不用寻死，我真急了！一齐杀了，我偿了命，大家干净！”\n　　正闹的不开交，只见尤氏等一群人来了，说：“这是怎么说？才好好的，就闹起来。”贾琏见了人，越发倚酒三分醉逞起威风来，故意要杀凤姐儿。凤姐儿见人来了，便不似先前那般泼了，撂下众人，便哭着往贾母那边跑。此时戏已散了，凤姐跑到贾母跟前，爬在贾母怀里，只说：“老祖宗救我，琏二爷要杀我呢！”贾母、邢夫人、王夫人等忙问：“怎么了？”凤姐儿哭道：“我才家去换衣裳，不防琏二爷在家和人说话。我只当是有客来了，唬的我不敢进去在窗户外头听了一听，原来是鲍二家的媳妇，商议说我利害，要拿毒药给我吃了，治死我，把平儿扶了正。我原生了气，又不敢和他吵，打了平儿两下子，问他为什么害我。他臊了，就要杀我。”贾母听了，都信以为真，说：“这还了得，快拿了那下流种子来！”一语未完，只见贾琏拿着剑赶来，后面许多人赶。贾琏明仗着贾母素昔疼他们，连母亲婶娘也无碍，故逞强闹了来。邢夫人王夫人见了，气的忙拦住骂道：“这下流东西，你越发反了！老太太在这里呢。”贾琏乜斜着眼道：“都是老太太惯的他，他才敢这么着。连我也骂起来了！”邢夫人气的夺下剑来，只管喝他：“快出去！”那贾琏撒娇撒痴，涎言涎语的还只管乱说。贾母气的说道：“我知道我们你放不到眼里！叫人把他老子叫了来，看他去不去！”贾琏听见这话，方趔趄着脚儿出去了。赌气也不往家去，便往外书房来。\n　　这里邢夫人、王夫人也说凤姐，贾母道：“什么要紧的事，小孩子们年轻，馋嘴猫儿似的，那里保的住呢？从小儿人人都打这么过。这都是我的不是，叫你多喝了两口酒，又吃起醋来了！”说的众人都笑了。贾母又道：“你放心，明儿我叫你女婿替你赔不是，你今儿别过去臊着他。”因又骂：“平儿那蹄子，素日我倒看他好，怎么背地里这么坏！”尤氏等笑道：“平儿没有不是，是凤丫头拿着人家出气。两口子生气，都拿着平儿煞性子，平儿委屈的什么儿似的，老太太还骂人家。”贾母道：“这就是了。我说那孩子倒不象那狐媚魇道的。既这么着，可怜见的，白受他的气。”因叫琥珀来：“你去告诉平儿，就说我的话，我知道他受了委曲，明儿我叫他主子来替他赔不是。今儿是他主子的好日子，不许他胡恼。”\n　　原来平儿早被李纨拉入大观园去了。平儿哭的哽咽难言，宝钗劝道：“你是个明白人，你们奶奶素日何等待你。今儿不过他多吃了一口酒，他可不拿你出气，难道拿别人出气不成？别人又笑话他是假的了。”正说着，只见琥珀走来，说了贾母的话，平儿自觉面上有了光辉，方才浙渐的好了，也不往前头来。宝钗等歇息了一回，方来看贾母凤姐。宝玉便让了平儿到怡红院中来，袭人忙接着，笑道：“我先原要让你的，只因大奶奶和姑娘们都让你，我就不好让的了。”平儿也陪笑说：“多谢。”因又说道：“好好儿的，从那里说起，无缘无故白受了一场气！”袭人笑道：“二奶奶素日待你好，这不过是一时气急了。”平儿道：“二奶奶倒没说的，只是那娼妇治的我，他又偏拿我凑趣儿！还有我们那糊涂爷，倒打我。”说着，便又委屈，禁不住泪流下来。宝玉忙劝道：“好姐姐，别伤心，我替他两个赔个不是罢。”平儿笑道：“与你什么相干？”宝玉笑道：“我们弟兄姐妹都一样。他们得罪了人，我替他赔个不是，也是应该的。”又道：“可惜这新衣裳也沾了。这里有你花妹妹的衣裳，何不换下来，拿些个烧酒喷了熨一熨，把头也另梳一梳。”一面说，一面吩咐了小丫头子们：“舀洗脸水，烧熨斗来。”\n　　平儿素昔只闻人说，宝玉专能和女孩们接交。宝玉素日因平儿是贾琏的爱妾，又是凤姐儿的心腹，故不肯和他厮近，因不能尽心，也常为恨事。平儿如今见他这般，心中暗暗的敁敪：“果然话不虚传，色色想的周到。”又见袭人特特的开了箱子，拿出两件不大穿的衣裳，忙来洗了脸。宝玉一旁笑劝道：“姐姐还该擦上些脂粉，不然倒象是和凤姐姐赌气的似的。况且又是他的好日子，而且老太太又打发人来安慰你。”平儿听了有理，便去找粉，只不见粉。宝玉忙走至妆台前，将一个宣窑磁盒揭开，里面盛着一排十根玉簪花棒儿，拈了一根递与平儿。又笑说道：“这不是铅粉，这是紫茉莉花种研碎了，对上料制的。”平儿倒在掌上看时，果见轻白红香，四样俱美，扑在面上也容易匀净，且能润泽，不象别的粉涩滞。然后看见胭脂，也不是一张，却是一个小小的白玉盒子，里面盛着一盒，如玫瑰膏子一样。宝玉笑道：“铺子里卖的胭脂不干净，颜色也薄，这是上好的胭脂拧出汁子来淘澄净了，配了花露蒸成的。只要细簪子挑一点儿，抹在唇上足够了，用一点水化开，抹在手心里，就够拍脸的了。”平儿依言妆饰，果见鲜艳异常，且又甜香满颊。宝玉又将盆内开的一支并蒂秋蕙用竹剪刀铰下来，替他簪在鬓上。忽见李纨打发丫头来唤他，方忙忙的去了。\n　　宝玉因自来从不曾在平儿前尽过心，——且平儿又是个极聪明，极清俊的上等女孩儿，比不得那起俗拙蠢物——深以为恨。今日是金钏儿生日，故一日不乐。不想后来闹出这件事来，竟得在平儿前稍尽片心，也算今生意中不想之乐，因歪在床上，心内怡然自得。忽又思及贾琏，惟知以淫乐悦己，并不知作养脂粉；又思平儿并无父母兄弟姊妹，独自一人，供应贾琏夫妇二人，贾琏之俗，凤姐之威，他竟能周全妥贴，今儿还遭荼毒，也就薄命的很了。想到此间，便又伤感起来。复又起身，见重喷的酒已干，便拿熨斗熨了叠好，见他的绢子忘了去，上面犹有泪痕，又搁在盆中洗了晾上。又喜又悲，闷了一回，也往稻香村来。说了回闲话儿，掌灯后方散。\n　　平儿就在李纨处歇了一夜，凤姐只跟着贾母睡。贾琏晚间归房，冷清清的，又不好去叫，只得胡乱睡了一夜。次日醒了，想昨日之事，大没意思．后悔不来。邢夫人惦记着昨日贾琏醉了，忙一早过来，叫了贾琏过贾母这边来。贾琏只得忍愧前来，在贾母面前跪下。贾母问他：“怎么了？”贾琏忙陪笑说：“昨儿原是吃了酒，惊了老太太的驾，今儿来领罪。”贾母啐道：“下流东西！灌了黄汤，不说安分守己的挺尸去，倒打起老婆来了！凤丫头成日家说嘴，霸王似的一个人，昨儿唬的可怜。要不是我，你要伤了他的命，这会子怎么样？”贾琏一肚子的委屈，不敢分辩，只认不是。贾母又道：“凤丫头和平儿还不是个美人胎子？你还不足，成日家偷鸡摸狗．腥的臭的，都拉了你屋里去！为这起娼妇打老婆，又打屋里的人，你还亏是大家子的公子出身，活打了嘴了。你若眼睛里有我，你起来，我饶了你，乖乖的替你媳妇赔个不是儿，拉了他家去，我就喜欢了。要不然，你只管出去．我也不敢受你的头。”贾琏听如此说，又见凤姐儿站在那边，也不盛妆，哭的眼睛肿着，也不施脂粉，黄黄脸儿，比往常更觉可怜可爱。想着不如赔了不是，彼此也好了，又讨老太太的喜欢。想毕便笑道：“老太太的话我不敢不依，只是越发纵了他了。”贾母笑道：“胡说！我知道他最有礼的，再不会冲撞人。他日后得罪了你，我自然也做主，叫你降伏就是了。”\n　　贾琏听说，爬起来，便与凤姐儿作了一个揖，笑道：“原是我的不是，二奶奶别生气了。”满屋里的人都笑了。贾母笑道：“凤丫头不许恼了。再恼，我就恼了。”说着，又命人去叫了平儿来，命凤姐儿和贾琏安慰平儿。贾琏见了平儿，越发顾不得了，所谓“妻不如妾”，听贾母一说，便赶上来说道：“姑娘昨日受了屈了，都是我的不是。奶奶得罪了你，也是因我而起。我赔了不是不算外，还替你奶奶赔个不是。”说着也作了一个揖，引的贾母笑了，凤姐儿也笑了。贾母又命凤姐来安慰平儿，平儿忙走上来给凤姐儿磕头，说：“奶奶的千秋，我惹的奶奶生气，是我该死。”凤姐儿正自愧悔昨日酒吃多了，不念素日之情，浮躁起来，听了旁人的话，无故给平儿没脸！今见他如此，又是惭愧又是心酸，忙一把拉起来，落下泪来。平儿道：“我伏侍了奶奶这么几年，也没弹我一指甲。就是昨儿打我，我也不怨奶奶，都是那娼妇治的，怨不得奶奶生气。”说着也滴下泪来了。贾母便命人：“将他三人送回房去。有一个再提此话，即刻来回我，我不管是谁，拿拐棍子给他一顿。”三个人从新给贾母、邢王二位夫人磕了头，老嬷嬷答应了，送他三人回去。\n　　至房中，凤姐见无人，方说道：“我怎么象个阎王，又象夜叉？那娼妇咒我死，你也帮着咒我。千日不好也有一日好，可怜我熬的连个混账女人也不及了。我还有什么脸过这个日子！”说着又哭了。贾琏道：“你还不足！你细想想，昨儿谁的不是多？今儿当着人，还是我跪了一跪，又赔不是，你也争足了光了。这会子还唠叨，难道你还叫我替你跪下才罢？太要足了强也不是好事！”说的凤姐儿无言可对，平儿嗤的一声又笑了。贾琏也笑道：“又好了！真真的我也没法了。”\n　　正说着，只见一个媳妇来回话：“鲍二媳妇吊死了！”贾琏凤姐儿都吃了一惊。凤姐忙收了怯色，反喝道：“死了罢了，有什么大惊小怪的！”一时见林之孝家的进来，悄回凤姐道：“鲍二媳妇吊死了，他娘家的亲戚要告呢。”凤姐儿冷笑道：“这倒好了，我正想要打官司呢！”林之孝家的道：“我才和众人劝了会子，又威吓了一阵，又许了他几个钱，也就依了。”凤姐儿道：“我没一个钱，有钱也不给他！只管叫他告去。也不许劝他，也不用镇唬他，只管叫他告！他告不成，我还问他个‘以尸诈讹’呢！”林之孝家的正在为难，见贾琏和他使眼色儿，心下明白，便出来等着。贾琏道：“我出去瞧瞧，看是怎么样。”凤姐儿道：“不许给他钱！”\n　　贾琏一径出来，和林之孝来商议，着人去做好做歹，许了二百两发送才罢。贾琏生恐有变，又命人去和坊官等说了，将番役仵作人等叫几名来，帮着办丧事。那些人见了如此，纵要复辩亦不敢辩，只得忍气吞声罢了。贾琏又命林之孝将那二百银子入在流水账上，分别添补，开消过去。又体已给鲍二些银两，安慰他说：“另日再挑个好媳妇给你。”鲍二又有体面又有银子，有何不依，便仍然奉承贾琏，不在话下。\n里面凤姐心中虽不安，面上只管佯不理论。因屋里无人，便和平儿笑道：“我昨儿多喝了一口酒，你别埋怨。打了那里？我瞧瞧。”平儿听了，眼圈儿一红，连忙忍住了，说道：“也没打着。”只听得外面说：“奶奶姑娘们都进来了。”\n要知后来端底，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "Baoyu was sitting with the girls and the rest watching The Thorn Hairpin, and when it came to the scene of the sacrifice Daiyu observed to Baochai, “This Wang Shipeng is a hopeless fool. He could have sacrificed anywhere, why did he have to go to the river bank? As the proverb says, ‘The object calls the person to mind.’ All the water in the world comes from the same source. He could have scooped up a bowl of water anywhere, looked at it and wept — that would have been just as expressive.”\n\nBaochai made no comment, but Baoyu hearing this was lost in thought again.\n\nNow the Lady Dowager’s idea was that this was no ordinary occasion and she wanted Xifeng to enjoy herself to the full. Not feeling like sitting through the feast herself, she reclined on a couch in the inner room with Aunt Xue watching the plays and choosing a few favourite dishes which were placed on a small table for her to nibble as she chatted. She gave the two tables assigned to her to the chief maids and serving-women who had no seats, ordering them to take these to the verandah outside the window and sit there to eat and drink at their ease without standing on ceremony. Lady Wang and Lady Xing sat at high tables on the floor below, while outside were several tables for the young people.\n\nThe Lady Dowager kept telling Madam You, “Put Xifeng in the seat of honour and play hostess well for me. She deserves it after slaving all the year round.”\n\nMadam You assented and reported laughingly, “She says she’s not used to the seat of honour. Sitting at the head of the table, she feels out of place and won’t drink.”\n\nThe old lady chuckled, “You don’t know how to handle her. Wait till I come and press her.”\n\nXifeng hurried in to protest laughingly, “Don’t believe her, Old Ancestor. I’ve drunk several cups already.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager ordered Madam You with a smile, “Drag her out and make her sit down. Then all of you take it in turn to toast her. If she still won’t drink, I’ll really come and force her.”\n\nAt that Madam You promptly smilingly hauled Xifeng out and made her take a seat, then ordered a maid to fill a cup for her.\n\n“You’ve slaved all the year round waiting on the old lady and our mistress, as well as me,” she said. “I’ve no way to show my appreciation today except by offering you a drink myself. My pet, do me the favour of drinking this cup.”\n\nXifeng smiled. “If you really mean to show your respect, kneel down and I’ll drink.”\n\n“You’re carrying it too far,” retorted Madam You. “I’ll tell you what. Who knows if we shall ever have another day like this? Make the most of it by drinking a couple of cups.”\n\nXifeng could not get out of it and had to drink two cups.\n\nThen the girls came to toast her and she had to take a sip from each of their cups. And when Mother Lai saw how merry the Lady Dowager was, she felt she must join in the fun too. She came with some other nurses to offer a toast, and again Xifeng could not refuse but had to drink a few sips. Then Yuanyang and the other maids came as well to toast her.\n\n“Do let me off, good sisters,” Xifeng begged. “I’ll make it up to you another day.”\n\n“Aren’t we good enough?” Yuanyang protested. “Why, even in the presence of Her Ladyship she gives us face. You used to show us some respect too, madam, but today, in front of all these people, you’re putting on airs. We shouldn’t have come. If you won’t drink, we’ll go.” She turned to leave.\n\nXifeng hastily stopped her, saying, “All right, good sister, I’ll drink.” She took the wine and drained a cup, at which Yuanyang went away smiling.\n\nThen Xifeng returned to her seat. She was feeling the effects of the wine and her heart was beating so fast that she wanted to go home to rest. But just then some variety shows started.\n\n“Get ready the tips,” she told Madam You. “I’m going to wash my face.”\n\nMadam You nodded.\n\nAs no one was watching, Xifeng slipped out of the banquet and made her way under the eaves behind the room. Pinger, who had been keeping an eye on her, promptly followed and Xifeng leaned on her.\n\nAs soon as she reached the covered walk she saw one of her maids standing there. At sight of her and Pinger the girl turned and ran. This made Xifeng suspicious and she called to her to stop. The maid pretended not to hear but had to turn back when called repeatedly. More suspicious than ever, Xifeng hurried into the walk with Pinger and made the girl follow them inside. She opened the partition and sat down on the steps of the courtyard, ordering the maid to kneel down.\n\n“Call two pages from the inner gate,” she barked to Pinger. “Bring a rope and whip. I’ll beat the skin off this bitch who has no respect for her mistress.”\n\nThe maid was scared out of her wits. Weeping, she kowtowed and begged for mercy.\n\n“I’m not a ghost,” snapped Xifeng. “Why didn’t you stand still when you saw me instead of running away?”\n\n“I didn’t see you, madam. I ran because I was worried as there was no one in your room.”\n\n“If there was no one there, who told you to come? You may not have seen me, but why did you run when Pinger and I called you again and again? We weren’t far off. Are you deaf? How dare you answer me back?”\n\nShe slapped the girl’s face, knocking her sideways, then slapped her other cheek so hard that the maid’s face swelled up and turned purple.\n\n“Don’t hurt your hand, madam,” Pinger urged.\n\n“Hit her again and ask why she was running,” cried Xifeng. “If she doesn’t confess, tear her mouth.”\n\nThe maid went on protesting until Xifeng threatened to burn her lips with a red-hot iron. Then she sobbed, “The master’s at home. He sent me to keep watch for you, madam, and to report to him as soon as you’d left the party. I never thought you’d be back so soon.”\n\n“Why keep watch?” demanded Xifeng. “Doesn’t he want me to come home? There must be some reason. Out with it, and I’ll be good to you from now on. If you don’t tell the truth, I’ll get a knife and slice your flesh!” She took a hairpin from her hair and stabbed the girl’s mouth with it.\n\nThe maid, dodging and weeping, pleaded, “I’ll tell you, but don’t let on that I told you.”\n\nPinger urged her to hurry up and speak.\n\n“The master only came back a little time ago,” said the maid. “He opened the case, took out two pieces of silver and two hairpins, and two lengths of silk, and told me to take them quietly to Bao Er’s wife and ask her to come over. After she’d taken the things she came to our place. The master told me to keep watch for you. I don’t know what happened after that.”\n\nXifeng was quivering with rage.\n\n“I see,” she said.\n\nShe stood up and started straight back. As she reached the gate of her compound, another young maid stationed there peeped out and at sight of her promptly darted back. Xifeng called her by name and scolded her. The girl was too shrewd to hide, so she ran out smiling.\n\n“I was just going to report to you, madam. Fancy your coming back!”\n\n“What have you to report?”\n\n“The master’s at home....” She repeated what the other maid had said.\n\nXifeng spat in her face. “What were you waiting for? Why report only when you’d been caught?” She slapped her so hard that the girl staggered, then tiptoed away.\n\nXifeng walked softly up to the window and overheard a woman inside laugh and say, “If only that king of hell who calls herself your wife would die!”\n\n“If she died and I married again, she’d probably be just the same,” replied Jia Lian. “And anyway....”\n\nAnother voice said: “If she were to die, you could make Ping’er your official wife. That would be better.”\n\n“She won’t let me come near her either now,” Jia Lian rejoined. “Ping’er has her grievances too, but doesn’t dare complain. Am I fated to be plagued by a shrew?”\n\nXifeng heard this and trembled with rage. Their praise of Ping’er made her suspect that the latter too must often complain about her behind her back. The wine mounting to her head left no room for reflection. She turned to box Ping’er’s ears, then kicked open the door and rushed in. Without a word she seized Bao Er’s wife and started pummelling her. Afraid that Jia Lian might slip away, she planted herself in the doorway and railed at her:\n\n“You whore! So you carry on with my husband behind my back and plot to kill me! Come here, Ping’er. You whores are in league against me because you can’t bear the sight of me. Outwardly you hoodwink me....” She struck Ping’er several more blows.\n\nPing’er could not defend herself and wept with rage.\n\n“You do these shameless things, why drag me in?” she sobbed. And she set about beating Bao Er’s wife too.\n\nJia Lian, who had been in high spirits when he came in and not too careful because he was drunk, was completely nonplussed by Xifeng’s sudden appearance. And when Ping’er joined in the fray, the wine rushed to his head. He had been angry and ashamed to see Xifeng beating Bao Er’s wife, but unable to interfere. Now that Ping’er was laying about her too, he stepped forward to kick her.\n\n“Bitch!” he swore. “How dare you hit anyone!”\n\nIntimidated, Ping’er hastily dropped her hands.\n\n“What have your underhand talk to do with me?” she whimpered.\n\nXifeng, infuriated by her fear of Jia Lian, slapped Ping’er again and ordered her to go on beating Bao Er’s wife. In desperation Ping’er rushed out to look for a knife to kill herself, but the maids and old nurses outside quickly stopped her and tried to reason with her.\n\nWhen Xifeng saw that Ping’er meant to kill herself, she butted Jia Lian with her head.\n\n“They’re all in league against me,” she cried. “And when I catch them at it they try to scare me. You’d better strangle me!”\n\nIn a rage Jia Lian snatched a sword from the wall.\n\n“There’s no need to do away with yourself,” he fumed. “I’ll kill the lot of you, then pay with my own life. That will settle everything.”\n\nAt the height of the commotion Madam You and some others arrived.\n\n“What’s all this?” they asked. “We were getting on fine. Why this sudden row?”\n\nThe arrival of others made Jia Lian more of a bully than ever. He postured with his sword as if to kill Xifeng, while Xifeng for her part ran to throw herself on the Lady Dowager.\n\nBy this time the operas were over and the Lady Dowager, surprised to see Xifeng run up to her dishevelled and in tears, asked what had happened.\n\nXifeng sobbed, “I’d just gone home to change my clothes when unexpectedly Lian Er came back with a guest. I didn’t like to go in and was listening outside the window when I heard his whore — that wife of Bao Er’s — complaining that I’m a shrew and plotting to poison me so that they can make Ping’er his wife. I was so angry I gave Ping’er a couple of slaps and asked why they wanted to kill me. Then Lian Er lost his temper and tried to kill me.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the others believed this.\n\n“How outrageous!” exclaimed the old lady. “Fetch the degenerate at once.”\n\nShe had hardly spoken when Jia Lian came charging in, brandishing his sword. Knowing that the Lady Dowager doted on him and that his mother and aunt could not control him, he was putting on this show to intimidate Xifeng. Lady Xing and Lady Wang angrily barred his way.\n\n“You degenerate!” they scolded. “Have you taken leave of your senses? The old lady is here.”\n\nJia Lian pulled a wry face.\n\nWith a glare she retorted, “It’s the old lady who’s spoiled her and made her so high and mighty. Now she’s cursing even me!”\n\nLady Xing in a rage snatched the sword from her and scolded her: “Get out!”\n\nBut still Chia Lien, in a transport of drunkenness, went on ranting and raving.\n\n“I know you’ve no use for any of us,” stormed the Lady Dowager. “Send for his father to take him away.”\n\nOnly then did Chia Lien slink off, stamping angrily out of the house and making for his study outside.\n\nLady Hsing and Lady Wang started remonstrating with Hsi-feng, but the old lady said, “It’s nothing serious. Young people are like cats that have tasted cream — you can’t blame them for it. We all come through that. It’s my fault for making you drink so much, and now you’re tipsy and jealous.” This set everyone laughing.\n\n“Don’t worry,” the old lady told Hsi-feng. “I’ll make your husband apologize to you tomorrow. But don’t go over there now to shame him.” She scolded, “That wretch Pinger! I always thought her a good girl, but to think she’s so sly behind our backs!”\n\n“Pinger’s not to blame,” said Madam Yu. “Hsi-feng’s just venting her spite on her. When those two quarrel, they both take it out on Pinger. She feels terribly wronged, yet you blame her, madam.”\n\n“In that case, the child’s not one of those seductive bitches. Poor thing, she has to put up with their tantrums for nothing.” She told Hu-po, “Go and tell Pinger from me that I know how she’s been wronged, and tomorrow I’ll make her mistress apologize. But today is her mistress’ birthday, and she mustn’t make a scene.”\n\nNow Pinger had already been taken by Li Wan to the Garden. She was crying as if her heart would break.\n\n“You’re a sensible girl,” Pao-chai consoled her. “You know how good your mistress has always been to you. Today she’s had a drop too much and it’s only to be expected that she should vent her anger on you — she couldn’t very well take it out on anyone else, or people would laugh and say she was shamming.”\n\nAs she was speaking Hu-po arrived and delivered the old lady’s message. Pinger, feeling that she had been vindicated, gradually cheered up and did not go back to the front.\n\nAfter a little rest Pao-chai and the others returned to the old lady and Hsi-feng, while Pao-yu invited Pinger to Happy Red Court. There Hsi-jen welcomed her, saying with a smile:\n\n“I meant to ask you over, but as the other ladies and girls did so I didn’t like to.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Pinger with a smile. Then she sighed. “Why should this happen out of the blue? I’ve been wronged for nothing.”\n\n“The mistress has always been good to you,” Hsi-jen reminded her. “She was just in a temper.”\n\n“I’ve nothing against the mistress. But that bitch has it in for me, and she had to drag me into it. And that crazy fool of a master beat me!” She broke down again in tears of self-pity.\n\n“Don’t be upset, dear sister,” begged Pao-yu. “Let me apologize for them.”\n\n“What has it to do with you?” Pinger had to smile.\n\n“We brothers and cousins are all one. If they offend anyone, I should apologize.” He added, “It’s a pity your new clothes are spoiled. There are some of Cousin Hua’s clothes here. Why not change and let me have yours sponged and pressed? And you can do your hair again.”\n\nHe ordered a maid to fetch water to wash her face and heat an iron.\n\nPinger had often heard that Pao-yu had a way with girls. But since she was Chia Lien’s favourite concubine and Hsi-feng’s right hand, and Pao-yu was on especially good terms with her mistress, she had never had much to do with him herself.\n\nShe was very fond of Ping-erh too, but had never had a chance to do anything for her. Today was Chin-chuan’s birthday, which had depressed him all day until this rumpus had unexpectedly given him a chance to show Ping-erh some small attention. This unforeseen pleasure was most satisfying. He lay down on his bed feeling very pleased with himself.\n\nThen his thoughts turned to Chia Lien, who thought of nothing but his own base pleasures and had no consideration for girls. Ping-erh had no parents, brothers or sisters of her own, yet single-handed she had to wait on him and his horrid wife. In spite of Chia Lien’s vulgarity and Hsi-feng’s tyranny, she had always managed to cope; yet today she had been wronged. Hers was indeed an ill-fated and wretched existence. At this point he felt very dejected.\n\nGetting up, he noticed that the wine he had sprayed on his gown had dried. He took an iron and pressed the gown, then folded it up. He noticed that Ping-erh had left her handkerchief. It was still stained with tears, so he washed it and hung it up. Then, in a melancholy mood, he went over to Paddy-Sweet Cottage. After chatting for a while he did not go back until the lamps were lit.\n\nPing-erh spent that night with Li Wan, while Hsi-feng slept in the Lady Dowager’s room. When Chia Lien went back to his empty room that evening he could not very well send for anyone, so he had to put up with his solitude. The next day he woke early to reflect on the previous day’s madness. It seemed to him that he had gone too far and he began to repent.\n\nHis mother, Lady Hsing, was concerned because of his drunkenness and came first thing to summon him to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. Ashamed as he felt, he had to go. He fell on his knees before his grandmother.\n\n“What have you to say for yourself?” she demanded.\n\n“I was drunk yesterday and disturbed you, madam,” he said with an apologetic smile. “I’ve come to apologize.”\n\n“Spittle worth of a man!” she swore. “After swilling that yellow soup, instead of sleeping it off like a decent fellow you have to beat your wife. That Phoenix is a regular termagant, yet you scared the poor thing out of her wits. If not for me, you might have killed her. What have you to say to that now?”\n\nJia Lian, not venturing to defend himself, had to admit he was in the wrong.\n\n“Isn’t Xifeng a regular beauty?” demanded the Lady Dowager. “Isn’t Ping’er a charming girl too? Aren’t they enough for you? Must you go sniffing round all the bitches outside? You’ll take any stinking creature to your room. For the sake of such trollops you beat your wife and maids. How can a young gentleman from a good family behave so disgustingly? If you’ve any respect for me, get up. I’ll forgive you, but only on condition that you apologize to your wife and take her home. Then I’ll be pleased. Otherwise, just get out. I daren’t accept your kowtows.”\n\nWhen Jia Lian heard this and saw Xifeng standing there without her usual make-up, her eyes swollen with weeping, her sallow face more piteous and attractive than ever, he thought it would be best to apologize and be reconciled to please the old lady.\n\n“How can I disobey you, madam?” he said with a smile. “But you’re letting her off too lightly.”\n\n“Nonsense!” she retorted. “I know she’s the most correct and never offends anyone. If later she does offend you, I shall take her side and make you apologize to her.”\n\nAt that he got up and with a bow to Xifeng said, “It was my fault. I beg Your Ladyship’s pardon.”\n\nAll the others in the room laughed.\n\n“Don’t be angry any more, Feng,” said the Lady Dowager. “If you are, I shall be angry too.” She told the servants to fetch Ping’er, and ordered Xifeng and Jia Lian to comfort her.\n\nAt sight of Ping’er, Jia Lian felt more remorseful than ever. The proverb is true: “The wife is not as good as the concubine.” He stepped forward at the old lady’s bidding.\n\n“You were wronged yesterday, my dear,” he said. “It was my fault. And your mistress offended you because of me too. So now I’m apologizing to you as well as to her on her behalf.” He made another bow.\n\nThis amused the Lady Dowager and Xifeng as well.\n\nThen the Lady Dowager made Xifeng comfort Ping’er, who promptly came forward to kotow to her.\n\n“I deserve death for provoking you on your birthday, madam,” she said.\n\nXifeng, who was already conscience-stricken at having drunken so much the day before that she lost her temper and, listening to gossip, had unjustly humiliated Ping’er, now felt both ashamed and distressed. She hastily helped her up.\n\n“After serving you all these years, madam, you’ve never so much as flicked me with your finger,” said Ping’er. “Of course I’ve no call to bear a grudge for yesterday’s beating. It was that whore who egged you on. No wonder you were angry.” She too started weeping.\n\n“Very well then,” said the Lady Dowager. “I’m sending the three of you back to your own apartments. If any of you says one word more about this, just let me know and I’ll give the culprit a good beating, no matter who it is, with my crutch.” She ordered some old nurses to see them back, and the three of them kotowed to her and to Lady Xing and Lady Wang before leaving.\n\nOnce in their own room, Xifeng seeing there was no one else about said, “Why should I be considered a perfect horror? That whore wished me dead, and you helped her. I may have my faults, but I have my good points too. It’s too bad that I should be considered worse than a bitch. How can I hold up my head and go on living?” She burst into tears again.\n\n“Isn’t that enough?” retorted Jia Lian. “Think carefully: which of us was more to blame yesterday? Even though I kotowed and apologized to you today in front of everyone, you’ve scored plenty. Why keep on nagging? Do you expect me to kotow to you again? Don’t be too overbearing.”\n\nXifeng had no answer to this. Ping’er giggled.\n\n“There now, it’s all right,” said Jia Lian, laughing. “I really don’t know what to do with you.”\n\nJust then a servant came in to announce, “Bao Er’s wife has hanged herself!”\n\nJia Lian and Xifeng were consternated. But Xifeng quickly suppressed her alarm and retorted, “What if she has? What’s all the excitement about?”\n\nSoon Lin Zhixiao’s wife came in and quietly told Xifeng, “That woman Bao Er has hanged herself, and her family are threatening to take the case to court.”\n\nXifeng smiled coldly. “That’s good. I was hoping to go to law.”\n\n“I’ve just been talking to them and trying to reason with them for a while,” said Mrs. Lin. “Then I scared them and promised them some money, and now they’ve agreed.”\n\n“I haven’t any money to give them. Even if I had, I wouldn’t. Let them sue. Don’t try to reason with them or scare them either. Let them take it to court. If they lose, I’ll charge them with trying to extort money by false pretences.”\n\nMrs. Lin was standing there nonplussed when Jia Lian shot her a glance. Taking the hint, she withdrew and waited outside.\n\n“I’ll go and see what can be done,” he said.\n\n“Don’t give them any money!” Xifeng warned him.\n\nJia Lian went out to consult with Lin Zhixiao, then sent servants to threaten the woman’s family and cajole them, finally promising two hundred taels for the funeral. To prevent further trouble he also sent to inform the local yamen, and asked for a few bailiffs and coroners to help. At this the dead woman’s relatives had to pocket their resentment, not daring to make any more trouble. Jia Lian ordered Lin Zhixiao to enter the two hundred taels in the general account to be made up and written off later. He also gave Bao Er some silver himself to console him, promising, “I’ll find you another good wife one of these days.” Since this meant both money and face for him, Bao Er was quite content and went on serving Jia Lian as before.\n\nAs for Xifeng, though inwardly rather uneasy she put on a bold front. When there was no one else in the room she said to Pinger with a smile:\n\n“I’d had too much to drink yesterday. I hope you don’t bear a grudge. Where did I hurt you? Let me see.”\n\nPinger’s eyes reddened, but she restrained herself.\n\n“You didn’t hurt me,” she answered.\n\nThen someone outside announced, “The young ladies are here, madam.”\n\nIf you want to know what followed, read the next chapter."
