  "original": "话说是日贾敬的寿辰，贾珍先将上等可吃的东西、稀奇的果品，装了十六大捧盒，着贾蓉带领家下人送与贾敬去，向贾蓉说道：“你留神看太爷喜欢不喜欢，你就行了礼起来，说：‘父亲遵太爷的话，不敢前来，在家里率领合家都朝上行了礼了。’”贾蓉听罢，即率领家人去了。\n　　这里渐渐的就有人来。先是贾琏、贾蔷来看了各处的座位，并问：“有什么玩意儿没有？”家人答道：“我们爷算计，本来请太爷今日来家，所以并未敢预备玩意儿。前日听见太爷不来了，现叫奴才们找了一班小戏儿并一档子打十番的，都在园子里戏台上预备着呢。”次后邢夫人、王夫人、凤姐儿、宝玉都来了，贾珍并尤氏接了进去。尤氏的母亲已先在这里，大家见过了，彼此让了坐。贾珍、尤氏二人递了茶，因笑道：“老太太原是个老祖宗，我父亲又是侄儿，这样年纪，这个日子，原不敢请他老人家来。但是这时候，天气又凉爽，满园的菊花盛开，请老祖宗过来散散闷，看看众儿孙热热闹闹的，是这个意思。谁知老祖宗又不赏脸。”凤姐儿未等王夫人开口，先说道：“老太太昨日还说要来呢，因为晚上看见宝兄弟吃桃儿，他老人家又嘴馋，吃了有大半个，五更天时候就一连起来两次。今日早晨略觉身子倦些，因叫我回大爷，今日断不能来了，说有好吃的要几样，还要很烂的呢。”贾珍听了笑道：“我说老祖宗是爱热闹的，今日不来必定有个缘故，这就是了。”\n　　王夫人说：“前听见你大妹妹说，蓉哥媳妇身上有些不大好，到底是怎么样？”尤氏道：“他这个病得的也奇。上月中秋还跟着老太太、太太玩了半夜，回家来好好的。到了二十日以后，一日比一日觉懒了，又懒怠吃东西，这将近有半个多月。经期又有两个月没来。”邢夫人接着说道：“不要是喜罢？”正说着，外头人回道：“大老爷、二老爷并一家的爷们都来了，在厅上呢。”贾珍连忙出去了。这里尤氏复说：“从前大夫也有说是喜的。昨日冯紫英荐了他幼时从学过的一个先生，医道很好，瞧了说不是喜，是一个大症候。昨日开了方子，吃了一剂药。今日头晕的略好些，别的仍不见大效。”凤姐儿道：“我说他不是十分支持不住，今日这样日子，再也不肯不挣扎着上来。”尤氏道：“你是初三日在这里见他的。他强扎挣了半天，也是因你们娘儿两个好的上头，还恋恋的舍不得去。”凤姐听了，眼圈儿红了一会子，方说道：“天有不测风云，人有旦夕祸福。这点年纪，倘或因这病上有个长短，人生在世，还有什么趣儿呢！”\n　　正说着，贾蓉进来，给邢夫人、王夫人、凤姐儿都请了安，方回尤氏道：“方才我给太爷送吃食去，并说我父亲在家伺候老爷们，款待一家子爷们，遵太爷话，并不敢来。太爷听了很喜欢，说：‘这才是。’叫告诉父亲母亲，好生伺候太爷太太们。叫我好生伺候叔叔婶子并哥哥们。还说：‘那《阴骘文》叫他们急急刻出来，印一万张散人。’我将这话都回了我父亲了。我这会子还得快出去打发太爷们并合家爷们吃饭。”凤姐儿说：“蓉哥儿，你且站着。你媳妇今日到底是怎么着？”贾蓉皱皱眉儿说道：“不好呢。婶子回来瞧瞧去就知道了。”于是贾蓉出去了。这里尤氏向邢夫人、王夫人道：“太太们在这里吃饭，还是在园子里吃去？有小戏儿现在园子里预备着呢。”王夫人向邢夫人道：“这里很好。”尤氏就吩咐媳妇婆子们快摆饭来。门外一齐答应了一声，都各人端各人的去了。不多时摆上了饭，尤氏让邢夫人、王夫人并他母亲都上坐了，他与凤姐儿、宝玉侧席坐了。邢夫人、王夫人道：“我们来原为给大老爷拜寿，这岂不是我们来过生日来了么？”凤姐儿说：“大老爷原是好养静的，已修炼成了，也算得是神仙了。太太们这么一说，就叫作‘心到神知’了。”一句话说得满屋子里笑起来。\n　　尤氏的母亲并邢夫人、王夫人、凤姐儿都吃了饭，批口净了手。才说要往园子里去，贾蓉进来向尤氏道：“老爷们并各位叔叔哥哥们都吃了饭了。大老爷说家里有事，二老爷是不爱听戏，又怕人闹的慌，都去了。别的一家子爷们被琏二叔并蔷大爷都让过去听戏去了。方才南安郡王、东平郡王、西宁郡王、北静郡王四家王爷，并镇国公牛府等六家、忠靖侯史府等人家，都差人持名帖送寿礼来，俱回了我父亲，收在账房里。礼单都上了档子了，领谢名帖都交给各家的来人了，来人也各照例赏过，都让吃了饭去了。母亲该请二位太太、老娘、婶子都过园子里去坐着罢。”尤氏道：“这里也是才吃完了饭，就要过去了。”凤姐儿说道：“我回太太，我先瞧瞧蓉哥媳妇儿去，我再过去罢。”王夫人道：“很是。我们都要去瞧瞧，倒怕他嫌我们闹的慌。说我们问他好罢。”尤氏道：“好妹妹，媳妇听你的话，你去开导开导他我也放心。你就快些过园子里来罢。”．\n　　宝玉也要跟着凤姐儿去瞧秦氏。王夫人道：“你看看就过来罢，那是侄儿媳妇呢。”于是尤氏请了王夫人、邢夫人并他母亲，都过会芳园去了，凤姐儿宝玉方和贾蓉到秦氏这边来。进了房门，悄悄的走到里间房内，秦氏见了要站起来。凤姐儿说：“快别起来，看头晕。”于是凤姐儿紧行了两步，拉住了秦氏的手，说道：“我的奶奶！怎么几日不见，就瘦的这样了！”于是就坐在秦氏坐的褥子上。宝玉也问了好，在对面椅子上坐了。贾蓉叫：“快倒茶来，婶子和二叔在上房还未吃茶呢。”\n　　秦氏拉着凤姐儿的手，强笑道：“这都是我没福。这样人家，公公婆婆当自家的女孩儿似的待。婶娘你侄儿虽说年轻，却是他敬我，我敬他，从来没有红过脸儿。就是一家子的长辈同辈之中，除了婶子不用说了，别人也从无不疼我的，也从无不和我好的。如今得了这个病，把我那要强心一分也没有。公婆面前未得孝顺一天，婶娘这样疼我，我就有十分孝顺的心，如今也不能够了。我自想着，未必熬得过年去。”\n　　宝玉正把眼瞅着那《海棠春睡图》并那秦太虚写的“嫩寒锁梦因春冷，芳气袭人是酒香”的对联，不觉想起在这里睡晌觉时梦到“太虚幻境”的事来，正在出神。听得秦氏说了这些话，如万箭攒心，那眼泪不觉流下来了。凤姐儿见了，心中十分难过，但恐病人见了这个样子反添心酸，倒不是来开导他的意思了，因说：“宝玉，你忒婆婆妈妈的了。他病人不过是这样说，那里就到这个田地？况且年纪又不大，略病病儿就好了。”又回向秦氏道：“你别胡思乱想，岂不是自己添病了么？”贾蓉道：“他这病也不用别的，只吃得下些饭食就不怕了。”凤姐儿道：“宝兄弟，太太叫你快些过去呢。你倒别在这里只管这么着，倒招得媳妇也心里不好过，太太那里又惦着你。”因向贾蓉说道：“你先同你宝叔叔过去罢，我还略坐坐呢。”贾蓉听说，即同宝玉过会芳园去。\n　　这里凤姐儿又劝解了一番，又低低说许多衷肠话儿。尤氏打发人来两三遍，凤姐儿才向秦氏说道：“你好生养着，我再来看你罢。合该你这病要好了，所以前日遇着这个好大夫，再也是不怕的了。”秦氏笑道：“任凭他是神仙，‘治了病治不了命’。婶子，我知道这病不过是挨日子的。”凤姐说道：“你只管这么想，这那里能好呢？总要想开了才好。况且听得大夫说，若是不治，怕的是春天不好。咱们若是不能吃人参的人家，也难说了；你公公婆婆听见治得好，别说一日二钱人参，就是二斤也吃得起。好生养着罢，我就过园子里去了。”秦氏又道：“婶子，恕我不能跟过去了。闲了的时候还求过来瞧瞧我呢，咱们娘儿们坐坐，说几句闲话儿。”凤姐儿听了，不觉的眼圈儿又红了，道：“我得了闲儿必常来看你。”\n　　于是带着跟来的婆子媳妇们，并宁府的媳妇婆子们，从里头绕进园子的便门来。只见：\n　　黄花满地，白柳横坡。小桥通若耶之溪，曲径接天台之路。石中清流滴滴，篱落飘香；树头红叶翩舞，疏林如画。西风乍紧，犹听莺啼。暖日常喧，又添毋语。遥望东南，建几处倚山之榭；近观西北，结三间临水之轩。笙簧盈座，别有幽情；罗绮穿林，倍添韵致。\n　　凤姐儿看着园中景致，一步步行来，正赞赏时，猛然从假山石后走出一个来，向前对凤姐说道：“请嫂子安。”凤姐猛吃一惊，将身往后一退，说道：“这是瑞大爷不是？”贾瑞说道：“嫂子连我也不认得了？”凤姐儿道：“不是不认得，猛然一见，想不到是大爷在这里。”贾瑞道：“也是合该我与嫂子有缘。我方才偷出了席，在这里清净地方略散一散，不想就遇见嫂子，这不是各缘么？”一面说着，一面拿眼睛不住的观看凤姐。\n　　凤姐是个聪明人，见他这个光景，如何不猜八九分呢，因向贾瑞假意含笑道：“怪不得你哥哥常提你，说你好。今日见了，听你这几句话儿，就知道你是个聪明和气的人了。这会于我要到太太们那边去呢，不得合你说话，等闲了再会罢。”贾瑞道：“我要到嫂子家里去请安，又怕嫂子年轻，不肯轻易见人。”凤姐又假笑道：“一家骨肉，说什么年轻不年轻的话。”贾瑞听了这话，心中暗喜，因想道：“再不想今日得此奇遇！”那情景越发难堪了。凤姐儿说道：“你快去入席去罢，看他们拿住了，罚你的酒。”贾瑞听了，身上已木了半边，慢慢的走着，一面回过头来看。凤姐儿故意的把脚放迟了，见他去远了，心里暗忖道：“这才是‘知人知面不知心’呢。那里有这样禽兽的人，他果如此，几时叫他死在我手里，他才知道我的手段！”\n　　于是凤姐儿方移步前来。将转过了一重山坡儿，见两三个婆子慌慌张张的走来，见凤姐儿，笑道：“我们奶奶见二奶奶不来，急的了不得，叫奴才们又来请奶奶来了。”凤姐儿说：“你们奶奶就是这样急脚鬼似的。”凤姐儿慢慢的走着，问：“戏文唱了几出了？”那婆子回道：“唱了八九出了。”说话之间，已到天香楼后门，见宝玉和一群丫头小子们那里玩呢。凤姐儿说：“宝兄弟，别忒淘气了。”一个丫头说道：“太太们都在楼上坐着呢，请奶奶就从这边上去罢。”\n　　凤姐儿听了，款步提衣上了楼。尤氏已在楼梯口等着。尤氏笑道：“你们娘儿两个忒好了，见了面总舍不得来了。你明日搬来和他同住罢。你坐下，我先敬你一钟。”于是凤姐儿至夫人、王夫人前告坐。尤氏拿戏单来让凤姐儿点戏，凤姐儿说：“太太们在这里，我怎么敢点。”邢夫人、王夫人道：“我们和亲家太太点了好几出了。你点几出好的我们听。”凤姐儿立起身来答应了，接过戏单，从头一看，点了一出《还魂》，一出《弹词》，递过戏单来，说：“现在唱的这《双官诰》完了，再唱这两出，也就是时候了。”王夫人道：“可不是呢，也该趁早叫你哥哥嫂子歇歇。他们心里又不静。”尤氏道：“太太们又不是常来的，娘儿们多坐一会子去，才有趣儿。天气还早呢。”凤姐儿立起身来望楼下看，说：“爷们都往那里去了？”傍边一个婆子道：“爷们才到凝曦轩，带了十番那里吃酒去了。”凤姐儿道：“在这里不便宜，背地里又不知干什么去了？”尤氏笑道：“那里都象你这么正经人呢！”\n　　于是说说笑笑，点的戏都唱完了，方才撤下酒席，摆上饭来。吃毕，大家才出园子，来到上房，坐下吃了茶，才叫预备车，向尤氏的母亲告了辞。尤氏率同众姬妻并家人媳妇们送出来，贾珍率领众子侄在车旁侍立，都等候着。见了邢、王二夫人，说道：“二位婶于明日还过来逛逛。”王夫人道：“罢了，我们今儿整坐了一日，也乏了，明日也要歇歇。”于是都上车去了。贾瑞犹不住拿眼看着凤姐儿。贾珍进去后，李贵才拉过马来，宝玉骑上，随了王夫人去了。\n　　这里贾珍同一家子的弟兄子侄吃过饭，方大家散了。次日仍是众族人等闹了一日，不必细说。此后凤姐不时亲自来看秦氏。秦氏也有几日好些，也有几日歹些。贾珍、尤氏、贾蓉甚是焦心。\n　　且说贾瑞到荣府来了几次，偏都值凤姐儿往宁府去了。这年正是十一月三十日冬至。到交节的那几日，贾母、王夫人、凤姐儿日日差人去看秦氏。回来的人都说：“这几日没见添病，也没见大好。”王夫人向贾母说：“这个症候遇着这样节气，不添病就有指望了。”贾母说：“可是呢。好个孩子，要有个长短，岂不叫人疼死。”说着，一阵心酸，向凤姐儿说道：“你们娘儿们好了一场，明日大初一，过了明日，你再看看他去。你细细的瞧瞧他的光景，倘或好些儿，你回来告诉我。那孩子素日爱吃什么，你也常叫人送些给他。”\n　　凤姐儿一一答应了。到初二日，吃了早饭，来到宁府里，看见秦氏光景，虽未添什么病，但那脸上身上的肉都瘦干了。于是和秦氏坐了半日，说了些闲话，又将这病无妨的话开导了一番。秦氏道：“好不好，春天就知道了。如今现过了冬至，又没怎么样，或者好的了也未可知。婶子回老太太、太太放心罢。昨日老太太赏的那枣泥馅的山药糕，我吃了两块，倒象克化的动的似的。”凤姐儿道：“明日再给你送来。我到你婆婆那里瞧瞧，就要赶着回去回老太太话去。”秦氏道：“婶子替我请老太太、太太的安罢。”凤姐儿答应着就出来了。到了尤氏上房坐下，尤氏道：“你冷眼瞧媳妇是怎么样？”凤姐儿低了半日头，说道：“这个就没法儿了，你也该将一应的后事给他料理料理，冲一冲也好。”尤氏道：“我也暗暗的叫人预备了。就是那件东西不得好木头，且慢慢的办着呢。”于是凤姐儿喝了茶，说了一会子话儿，说道：“我要快些回去回老太太的话去呢。”尤氏道：“你可慢慢儿的说，别吓着老人家。”凤姐儿道：“我知道。”\n　　于是凤姐儿起身回到家中，见了贾母，说：“蓉哥媳妇请老太太安，给老太太磕头，说他好些了。求老祖宗放心罢。他再略好些，还给老太太磕头请安来呢。”贾母道：“你瞧他是怎么样？”凤姐儿说：“暂且无妨，精神还好呢。”贾母听了，沉吟了半日，因向凤姐说：“你换换衣裳歇歇去罢。”\n凤姐儿答应着出来，见过了王夫人，到了家中，平儿将烘的家常衣服给凤姐儿换上了。凤姐儿坐下，因问：“家中有什么事没有？”平儿方端了茶来递过去，说道：“没有什么事。就是那三百两银子的利银，旺儿嫂子送进来，我收了。还有瑞大爷使人来打听奶奶在家没有，他要来请安说话。”凤姐儿听了，哼了一声，说道：“这畜生合该作死，看他来了怎么样！”平儿回道：“这瑞大爷是为什么，只管来？”凤姐儿遂将九月里在宁府园子里遇见他的光景、他说的话，都告诉了平儿。平儿说道：‘癞蛤螟想吃天鹅肉’，没人伦的混账东西，起这样念头，叫他不得好死！”凤姐儿道：“等他来了，我自有道理。”\n不知贾瑞来时作何光景，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "It was Jia Jing’s birthday and Jia Zhen had sixteen large hampers of the finest delicacies and rare fruits prepared. He sent Jia Rong with some servants to take them to his father.\n\n“See whether the old gentleman is pleased or not,” he charged him. “Kowtow to him and say, ‘My father is obeying your orders, sir, and doesn’t venture to call. At home he is leading the whole family in paying respects to you.’”\n\nJia Rong assented and went off with the servants.\n\nNow guests started arriving. First came Jia Lian and Jia Qiang, who looked at the seats prepared in different places and asked whether there was to be any entertainment.\n\n“Our master was counting on the old gentleman’s coming,” the servants told them, “so he didn’t venture to prepare any. But the day before yesterday, hearing that the old gentleman wouldn’t be coming, he sent at once to hire some players and a band of musicians. They’re waiting now on the stage in the garden.”\n\nThen the Lady Dowager, Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Xifeng and Baoyu arrived. Jia Zhen and Madam You welcomed them inside. Madam You’s mother had already come. After an exchange of greetings they took seats in order of seniority.\n\nJia Zhen and Madam You served tea.\n\n“The old lady is the senior of our clan,” said Jia Zhen, “and my father is only her nephew. At his age, on a day like this, we didn’t venture to invite him. But as the weather’s so pleasant now and the garden’s a mass of chrysanthemums, we thought we’d ask our Old Ancestress to come for an outing to amuse herself and see how her children and grandchildren are enjoying themselves. We didn’t expect her to refuse us her company.”\n\nBefore Lady Wang could speak Xifeng put in, “The old lady was meaning to come yesterday. But last evening she saw Baoyu eating peaches and was tempted to eat more than half of one herself. Then before dawn she had to get up twice. That’s why she feels rather tired this morning. She asked me to tell you she won’t be able to come after all, but she’d like some of the nicer dishes, if they’re very tender.”\n\nJia Zhen smiled.\n\n“I thought there must be some reason, as the old lady who loves fun wasn’t coming. So that’s it.”\n\n“The other day your sister told me that Rong’s wife is rather unwell,” said Lady Wang. “What’s the matter with her?”\n\n“It’s a strange complaint,” answered Madam You. “At the Mid-Autumn Festival last month she was playing until midnight with the old lady and Lady Wang, and when she went home she seemed well. But after the twentieth she’s been feeling more tired every day and has lost her appetite. It’s nearly a fortnight now that she’s been poorly, and she’s missed her periods for two months.”\n\n“Couldn’t it be that she’s pregnant?” asked Lady Xing.\n\nAs she spoke servants outside announced, “The master and the second master have come with the other gentlemen. They’re in the hall.”\n\nJia Zhen hurried out.\n\n“Doctors have said it might be a pregnancy,” Madam You continued. “But yesterday Feng Ziying recommended a former tutor of his who’s a very good physician. He examined her and says it’s not a child but a serious illness. He wrote a prescription yesterday and she took one dose. Today her giddiness is a little better, but there’s no other sign of improvement.”\n\n“If she weren’t seriously ill, a young wife like her would never let a day like this go by without putting in an appearance,” observed Xifeng.\n\n“You saw her here the other day,” said Madam You. “She forced herself to keep up for a while because she’s so fond of you and your mother-in-law, and was reluctant to leave.”\n\nXifeng’s eyes became red and after a pause she sighed, “Storm clouds gather without warning in nature, and bad luck befalls men overnight. But she’s so young! If anything should happen to her, life would hardly be worth living.”\n\nJust then Jia Rong came in to pay his respects to Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xifeng.\n\nJia Rong told Madam You, “I’ve just taken some dishes to His Lordship and explained that my father is entertaining the gentlemen at home as he was told to, not venturing to come over. His Lordship was very pleased. ‘That’s right,’ he said. He told me to inform my father and mother that they must wait on His Lordship and Her Ladyship well, and I must wait on my uncles, aunts and cousins well. He also said, ‘Get them to cut blocks at once for the Tract on Cause and Effect and to print ten thousand copies for distribution.’ I passed all this on to my father. Now I must hurry back to see about the meal for His Lordship and the other gentlemen.”\n\n“Wait a minute, Rong,” said Xifeng. “What’s your wife’s trouble today?”\n\n“Not too good. If you go back and have a look, aunt, you’ll see for yourself.” With that he left.\n\nThen Madam You asked Lady Xing and Lady Wang, “Will you have your meal here or in the garden? There are some players in the Garden ready to perform.”\n\n“This place is all right,” said Lady Wang to Lady Xing.\n\nMadam You ordered the servants to serve the meal at once. A chorus of assent was heard outside as the maids went to fetch the dishes. Soon the meal was served and Madam You, having invited Lady Xing, Lady Wang and her own mother to take the seats of honour, sat down with Xifeng and Baoyu at a side table.\n\n“We came to congratulate the Elder Master on his birthday,” remarked Lady Xing and Lady Wang. “This is as if we’d come to celebrate our own.”\n\n“The Elder Master is fond of quietness,” said Xifeng. “He’s already cultivated his mind so long, he’s practically an immortal. In his case, your good wishes are as good as a birthday celebration.” This set the whole room laughing.\n\nAs soon as Madam You’s mother and the two ladies has finished their meal and washed their hands, and they were on the point of going to the Garden, Jia Rong came in again to inform his mother, “The gentlemen have finished their meal. The Elder Master says he has business at home; the Second Master doesn’t care for plays and is afraid of noise, so they’ve both left. The other gentlemen have been invited by Uncle Lian and Brother Qiang to go and watch the performance. Just now the princes of Nanan, Dongping, Xining and Beijing as well as the six families including the Duke of Zhenguo’s and the Marquis of Zhongjing’s sent messengers with cards and birthday gifts. My father has accepted these and stored them in the account room. The lists of presents have been entered in the register, and the receipts have been given to the messengers, who have been tipped in the usual way and given a meal. Will you ask the two ladies, our old lady and aunt to come over to the Garden now?”\n\n“We’ve only just finished our meal and were about to go over,” said Madam You.\n\n“If you’ll excuse me, madam, I’ll go to see how Rong’s wife is before I join you,” volunteered Xifeng.\n\n“Quite right,” said Lady Wang. “We ought to go too, only we might tire her. Give her our best regards.”\n\n“Do, there’s a dear cousin,” begged Madam You. “I’d feel much easier if you had a little talk with her. But don’t be too long.”\n\nBaoyu wanted to go with Xifeng to see Qin-shi, but his mother said, “Now don’t you go and stay there. Remember, she’s your nephew’s wife.”\n\nSo Madam You invited Lady Wang, Lady Xing and her mother to go to the Garden, while Xifeng and Baoyu accompanied Jia Rong to see Qin-shi. They entered her room quietly and tip-toed into the inner chamber. Qin-shi tried to get up when she saw them.\n\n“Don’t move,” warned Xifeng quickly. “You’ll make yourself dizzy.”\n\nShe hastened forward to take Qin-shi’s hand.\n\n“Well!” she cried. “Why, in the last few days...”\n\nHe’s grown so thin in the short time since I saw him last!” She seated herself on the rug which had been spread for Qin-shi. Baoyu, after greeting her, sat down opposite in a chair.\n\n“Quickly, serve tea,” Jia Rong called to the maids. “My aunt and Uncle Bao haven’t had any tea yet in the main room.”\n\nQin-shi took Xifeng’s hand and forced a smile.\n\n“It’s my bad luck,” she said. “In a family like this the parents-in-law treat their daughter-in-law as their own daughter. And though your nephew’s young, we’ve such respect for each other, we’ve never exchanged a cross word. All the older and younger members of the household, not to mention you, my dear aunt, are good to me and we get on well together. Now that I’ve fallen ill like this and all my energy has gone, I haven’t been able to do my duty by my parents-in-law for a single day. And much as I’d like to show my affection for you, aunt, there’s no chance of that now either. I don’t think I’ll last the year out.”\n\nBaoyu was staring at the painting Hibiscus Slumbers in Spring and the couplet by Qin Guan on the wall:\n\nCoolness wraps her dream, for spring is chill;\n\nA fragrance assails men, the aroma of wine.\n\nHe was reminded of his dream here of the Illusory Land of Great Void when he had dozed in this room. He was lost in reverie when Qin-shi’s words pierced his heart like countless arrows. Tears ran down his cheeks.\n\nXifeng was bitterly distressed but, not wishing to add to the invalid’s misery by a show of grief, felt it her duty to comfort her.\n\n“Baoyu, don’t carry on like an old woman,” she scolded. “A sick person just talks like this. She’s not as bad as all that. Besides, she’s young. She’ll get over it after being ill for a bit.”\n\nShe turned back to Qin-shi. “If you give way to such fancies, aren’t you just asking for trouble?”\n\n“She’ll be all right if she can only eat a little,” said Jia Rong.\n\n“Sister-in-law,” Xifeng told Baoyu, “her Ladyship wants you to go over. Don’t stay here upsetting her and making her feel worse, when she’s worrying about you too.”\n\nTo Jia Rong she said, “Take your Uncle Bao over first. I’ll sit here a little longer.”\n\nJia Rong at once led Baoyu off to the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.\n\nXifeng stayed to offer Qin-shi more comfort and a few words of advice, speaking to her very kindly and confidentially. When Madam You sent for her several times, she said at last:\n\n“Do look after yourself well. I’ll come to see you again. It’s a good thing you’ve fallen ill just now when we’ve found this good doctor. I’m sure you’ve nothing to fear.”\n\n“Auntie,” said Qin-shi with a smile, “even if he were an immortal he could cure the sickness but not the fate. I know this is my last illness.”\n\n“If you keep thinking that way how can you get well? You must look on the bright side. Besides, the doctor says if it isn’t cured there may be a change for the worse in the spring. But we’re not like people who can’t afford ginseng. Don’t worry, your parents-in-law would provide two pounds a day if necessary, not just two mace, if they thought that would cure you. Take good care of yourself now. I’m going over to the garden.”\n\n“I’m sorry I can’t go with you, auntie,” said Qin-shi. “When you have time, please come over to see me again. We can have a quiet chat together.”\n\nXifeng’s eyes reddened again. “I’ll be sure to come when I’m free.”\n\nShe left then with the women attendants who had come with her and some from the Ning Mansion, going through the inner gate which led to the garden.\n\nGolden chrysanthemums carpeted the ground.\n\nWhite willows lined the slopes.\n\nA small bridge spanned a stream flowing to the Ruo Ye;\n\nA narrow path led to a hill like Tiantai.\n\nDrops dripped from a rock like a cleaving cloud;\n\nFragrance wafted through the woven wattle fence.\n\nThe red leaves danced on the trees.\n\nThe sparse woods made a picturesque setting. A sudden gust of west wind was followed by the cry of orioles. The warm sun’s genial rays were loud with the soft buzz of insects. In the distance, to the southeast, rose some pavilions on the hillside; closer at hand, to the northwest, could be seen three studies overhanging a stream. The fluting there sounded sweet, charged with some subtle feeling, while the sight of silk-clad forms passing through the trees added to the charm of the scene.\n\nXifeng was strolling through the garden enjoying this prospect when a young man suddenly stepped out from behind an artificial rockery and accosted her.\n\n“Greetings, sister-in-law.”\n\nXifeng stepped back in surprise.\n\n“Isn’t this Master Rui?” she asked.\n\n“Don’t you know me, sister-in-law?”\n\n“Of course, but I didn’t expect to meet you here.”\n\n“It must be fate.” He leered at her. “I slipped away from the feast to have a little quiet stroll and happened to meet you. This shows we’re fated to come together.”\n\nAs he spoke he eyed her greedily.\n\nXifeng, a shrewd woman, could guess what was in his mind.\n\n“No wonder your cousin is always saying what a clever, agreeable young man you are,” she said with a hypocritical smile. “I can see from what you’ve just said how intelligent and understanding you are. I’m on my way now to join the ladies, so I can’t stop to talk to you. We must meet again some other time.”\n\n“I’d like to call to pay my respects to you at home, sister-in-law, but I was afraid you might be too young to see visitors.”\n\n“Members of one family, young or old, what does age matter?”\n\nJia Rui was overjoyed by this.\n\n“What a stroke of luck to meet her like this today!” he thought. His expression grew even more repulsive.\n\n“Hurry back to the feast,” Xifeng urged him. “If they catch you playing truant, they’ll make you drink a forfeit.”\n\nHalf paralysed by this encounter, he slowly moved away, looking back at her over his shoulder. And Xifeng deliberately slowed down.\n\n“What a beast!” she thought when he was out of sight. “If he’s really such a fool, he’d better look out. One of these days he’ll find out what I’m like — but it will be too late.”\n\nShe walked on then and rounded a hill to be confronted by two or three matrons who hurried towards her in some agitation.\n\n“So here you are, madam!” they cried. “Our mistress was so worried at your long absence, she sent us to find you.”\n\n“Your mistress is like the devil in a hurry,” retorted Xifeng.\n\nShe sauntered on, asking, “How many scenes have been played?”\n\n“Eight or nine.”\n\nAs they spoke they reached the back door of Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, where Baoyu was playing with some maids and pages.\n\n“Don’t be too naughty, Cousin Bao,” warned Xifeng.\n\nOne of the maids said, “The ladies are all upstairs, madam. Will you go up this way?”\n\nXifeng gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs. Madam You was waiting for her at the top.\n\n“You and your mother-in-law are so devoted to each other, you can’t bear to part,” teased Madam You. “You’d better move in tomorrow to live with her. Sit down now and let me offer you a cup of wine.”\n\nXifeng asked Lady Xing and Lady Wang to be seated, then Madam You handed her the play-bill and asked her to choose a scene.\n\n“How can I choose in the presence of our elders?” she demurred.\n\nLady Xing and Lady Wang assured her, “We and our kinswoman have chosen several scenes. We’d like you to choose some good ones for us to hear.”\n\nXifeng rose to her feet to comply. Taking the list, she ran through it and chose two scenes: The Return of the Spirit and The Meeting.\n\nThe young maid presented Xifeng with a programme of ballads from which to choose.\n\n“After this show The Double Official Titles they’ll sing whichever two items you select,” she said.\n\n“Quite right too,” approved Lady Wang. “We should let your sister-in-law and the young people have a rest now. They must be tired out.”\n\n“But you don’t often call, madam,” protested Madam You. “Do stay a little longer. It’s still early.”\n\nXifeng rose to her feet and looked over the balcony.\n\n“Where have the gentlemen gone?” she asked.\n\nAn old woman nearby answered, “They’ve just gone to the Pavilion of Gathered Splendour, madam, to drink with the musicians.”\n\n“They’re not too comfortable here,” said Xifeng. “Heaven knows what they’ll be up to in private.”\n\n“Not all of them are as proper as you,” teased Madam You.\n\nAmid more joking and laughter the two items chosen were performed. Then the wine was removed and rice was served. When the meal was over the party left the garden and returned to the main reception room. After sipping tea there, they called for their carriages and took their leave of Madam You’s mother.\n\nMadam You and all her husband’s secondary wives and concubines saw them out, while Jia Zhen stood by the carriages with the young men of the family. When Lady Xing and Lady Wang appeared, he said:\n\n“I hope you will come again tomorrow, aunts.”\n\n“No, we’ve sat here the whole day and we’re tired,” said Lady Wang. “We shall be resting tomorrow.”\n\nThey then entered their carriages. Jia Rui could not keep his eyes off Xifeng. Not until Jia Zhen had gone back did Li Gui lead over Bao-yu’s horse for him to mount and follow his mother.\n\nJia Zhen and the other men of the family had their meal then before dispersing. The next day the clansmen made merry again, but we need not describe that.\n\nAfter this Xifeng went from time to time to see how Qin Keqing was. The invalid had her good days and her bad. Jia Zhen, Madam You and Jia Rong were very worried.\n\nNow Jia Rui called several times at the Rong Mansion, but as luck would have it Xifeng was always at the Ning Mansion. The winter solstice fell that year on the last day of the eleventh month. A few days before and after this turning-point of the year, the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and Xifeng sent daily to inquire after Qin Keqing, and the messengers all reported that although she was no worse she was no better either.\n\n“At such a season if she’s no worse there’s hope,” Lady Wang told the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Yes, of course, my dear. Such a sweet child! If anything were to happen to her, it would be too dreadful.”\n\nThe old lady’s eyes filled with tears.\n\n“You’ve always been good to her,” she told Xifeng. “You must go over the day after tomorrow to see how she is. Do all you can to cheer her up.”\n\n“I know how you feel,” Xifeng assured her.\n\n“Have a good look at her and let me know the truth when you come back. If she seems a little better, tell me. And find out what she fancies to eat. We must keep sending her things.”\n\nXifeng promised to do this.\n\nOn the second of the twelfth month, after breakfast, she went to the Ning Mansion. Qin Keqing, although no worse, was emaciated. Xifeng sat with her for a while and chatted, trying to comfort her and convince her that there was no danger.\n\n“I shall know whether I’ll recover or not when spring comes,” said Qin Keqing. “Now that the winter solstice has passed without any turn for the worse, there’s hope. Please set the old lady’s mind and Her Ladyship’s at rest. Yesterday the old lady sent me some yam cakes with jujube filling, and I managed to eat two. They seemed to be quite digestible.”\n\n“I’ll send you some more tomorrow,” promised Xifeng. “I’m going now to see your mother-in-law, as I must hurry back to report to the old lady.”\n\n“Do give them my respects.”\n\nXifeng assented and went to Madam You’s room.\n\n“Tell me frankly,” said Madam You when she was seated.\n\n\"How is she?\" Xifeng lowered her head for a while before replying, \"There's nothing to be done. You must make all the funeral preparations to break the bad luck.\"\n\n\"I've secretly sent to have things prepared. But we can't get good wood for that one thing, so we have to wait.\"\n\nXifeng sipped some tea and chatted a little longer, then said, \"I must hurry back to report to the old lady.\"\n\n\"Break it to her gently,\" urged Lady You. \"Don't give the old lady a fright.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nXifeng then went home. When she saw the Lady Dowager she said, \"Jung's wife pays her respects to you, madam. She kowtowed and says she's better. She begs you not to worry. As soon as she's a little stronger she'll come to kowtow and ask after your health herself.\"\n\n\"What do you think of her condition?\" asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n\"For the time being it's not serious; her spirit is good.\"\n\nThe old lady thought this over, then advised Xifeng, \"You'd better go and change your clothes and rest.\"\n\nXifeng assented and withdrew. Having paid her respects to Lady Wang she went home, where Pinger had warm everyday clothes ready for her to change into. Xifeng sat down and asked, \"Has anything happened at home?\"\n\n\"Nothing much,\" said Pinger, handing her tea. \"The interest on that three hundred taels has been brought by Sister-in-law Wang and I've accepted it. And Master Jia Rui sent to ask if you were at home. He wants to come and pay his respects.\"\n\nXifeng snorted. \"The beast is looking for death. Let's see what he does when he comes.\"\n\n\"Why does this Master Jia Rui keep coming here?\" asked Pinger.\n\nXifeng then described her encounter with him that time in the Ning Mansion garden and what he had said.\n\n\"A toad hankering for a taste of swan,\" scoffed Pinger. \"The beast has forgotten all the rules of behaviour. He's asking for trouble.\"\n\n\"Let him come,\" said Xifeng. \"I know how to deal with him.\"\n\nTo know what happened when Jia Rui called, read the next chapter."
