"话说宝玉正自发怔，不想黛玉将手帕子扔了来，正碰在眼睛上，倒唬了一跳，问：“这是谁？”黛玉摇着头儿笑道；“不敢，是我失了手。因为宝姐姐要看呆雁，我比给他看，不想失了手。”宝玉揉着眼睛，待要说什么，又不好说的。\n　　一时凤姐儿来了。因说起初一日在清虚观打醮的事来，约着宝钗、宝玉、黛玉等看戏去。宝钗笑道：“罢，罢，怪热的，什么没看过的戏！我不去。”凤姐道：“他们那里凉快，两边又有楼。咱们要去，我头几天先打发人去，把那些道士都赶出去，把楼上打扫了，挂起帘子来，一个闲人不许放进庙去，才是好呢。我已经回了太太了，你们不去，我自家去。这些日子也闷的很了，家里唱动戏，我又不得舒舒服服的看。”贾母听说，就笑道：“既这么着，我和你去。”凤姐听说，笑道：“老祖宗也去？敢情好了！就只是我不得受用了。”贾母道：“到明儿，我在正面楼上，你在旁边楼上，你也不用到我这边来立规矩，可好不好？”凤姐笑道：“这就是老祖宗疼我了。”贾母因向宝钗道：“你也去，连你母亲也去，长天老日的，在家里也是睡觉。”宝钗只得答应着。\n　　贾母又打发人去请了薛姨妈，顺路告诉王夫人，要带了他们姊妹去。王夫人因一则身上不好，二则预备元春有人出来，早已回了不去的，听贾母如此说，笑道：“还是这么高兴。打发人去到园里告诉，有要逛去的，只管初一跟老太太逛去。”这个话一传开了，别人还可已，只是那些丫头们，天天不得出门槛儿，听了这话，谁不要去，就是各人的主子懒怠去，他也百般的撺掇了去。因此李纨等都说去。贾母心中越发喜欢，早已吩咐人去打扫安置，不必细说。\n　　单表到了初一这一日，荣国府门前车辆纷纷，人马簇簇，那底下执事人等，听见是贵妃做好事，贾母亲去拈香，况是端阳佳节，因此凡动用的物件，一色都是齐全的，不同往日。少时贾母等出来，贾母坐一乘八人大轿，李氏、凤姐、薛姨妈每人一乘四人轿，宝钗、黛玉二人共坐一辆翠盖珠缨八宝车，迎春、探春、惜春三人共坐一辆朱轮华盖车。然后贾母的丫头鸳鸯、鹦鹉、琥珀、珍珠，黛玉的丫头紫鹃、雪雁、鹦哥，宝钗的丫头莺儿、文杏，迎春的丫头司棋、绣橘，探春的丫头侍书、翠墨，惜春的丫头入画、彩屏，薛姨妈的丫头同喜、同贵，外带香菱，香菱的丫头臻儿，李氏的丫头素云、碧月，凤姐儿的丫头平儿、丰儿、小红，并王夫人的两个丫头金钏、彩云，也跟了凤姐儿来。奶子抱着大姐儿，另在一辆车上。还有几个粗使的丫头，连上各房的老嬷嬷奶妈子，并跟着出门的媳妇子们，黑压压的站了一街的车。那街上的人见是贾府去烧香，都站在两边观看。那些小门小户的妇女，也都开了门在门口站着，七言八语，指手画脚，就象看那过会的一般。只见前头的全副执事摆开，一位青年公子骑着银鞍白马，彩辔朱缨，在那八人轿前领着，那些车轿人马，浩浩荡荡，一片锦绣香烟，遮天压地而来，却是鸦雀无闻，只有车轮马蹄之声。\n　　不多时，已到了清虚观门口。只听钟鸣鼓响，早有张法官执香披衣，带领众道土在路旁迎接。宝玉下了马，贾母的轿刚至山门以内，见了本境城隆土地各位泥塑圣像，便命往轿。贾珍带领各子弟上来迎接。凤姐儿的轿子却赶在头里先到了，带着鸳鸯等迎接上来，见贾母下了轿，忙要搀扶。可巧有个十二三岁的小道士儿，拿着个剪筒照管各处剪蜡花儿，正欲得便且藏出去，不想一头撞在凤姐儿怀里。凤姐便一扬手照脸打了个嘴巴，把那小孩子打了一个斤斗，骂道：“小野杂种！往那里跑？”那小道士也不顾拾烛剪，爬起来往外还要跑。正值宝钗等下车，众婆娘媳妇正围随的风雨不透，但见一个小道士滚了出来，都喝声叫：“拿，拿！打，打！”贾母听了，忙问：“是怎么了？”贾珍忙过来问。凤姐上去搀住贾母，就回说：“一个小道士儿剪蜡花的，没躲出去，这会子混钻呢。”贾母听说，忙道：“快带了那孩子来，别唬着他。小门小户的孩子，都是娇生惯养惯了的，那里见过这个势派？倘成唬着他，倒怪可怜见儿的。他老子娘岂不疼呢。”说着，便叫贾珍去好生带了来。贾珍只得去拉了，那孩子一手拿着蜡剪，跪在地下乱颤。贾母命贾珍拉起来，叫他不用怕，问他几岁了。那孩子总说不出话来。贾母还说：“可怜见儿的！”又向贾珍道：“珍哥带他去罢。给他几个钱买果子吃，别叫人难为了他。”贾珍答应，领出去了。\n　　这里贾母带着众人，一层一层的瞻拜观玩。外面小厮们见贾母等进入二层山门，忽见贾珍领了个小道士出来，叫人：“来带了去，给他几百钱、别难为了他。”家人听说，忙上来领去。贾珍站在台阶上，因问：“管家在那里？”底下站的小厮们见问，都一齐喝声说：“叫管家！”登时林之孝，一手整理着帽子，跑进来，到了贾珍跟前。贾珍道：“虽然这里地方儿大，今儿咱们的人多，你使的人，你就带了在这院里罢，使不着的，打发到那院里去。把小么儿们多挑几个在这二层门上和两边的角门上，伺候着要东西传话。你可知道不知道？今儿姑娘奶奶们都出来，一个闲人也不许到这里来。”林之孝忙答应“知道”，又说了几个“是”。贾珍道：“去罢。”又问：“怎么不见蓉儿？”一声未了，只见贾蓉从钟楼里跑出来了。贾珍道：“你瞧瞧，我这里没热，他倒凉快去了！”喝命家人啐他。那小厮们都知道贾珍素日的性子，违拗不得，就有个小厮上来向贾蓉脸上啐了一口。贾珍还瞪着他，那小厮便问贾蓉：“爷还不怕热，哥儿怎么先凉快去了？”贾蓉垂着手，一声不敢言语。那贾芸、贾萍、贾芹等听见了，不但他们慌了，并贾琏，贾、贾琼等也都忙了，一个一个都从墙根儿底下慢慢的溜下来了。贾珍又向贾蓉道：“你站着做什么？还不骑了马跑到家里告诉你娘母子去！老太太和姑娘们都来了，叫他们快来伺候！”贾蓉听说，忙跑了出来，一叠连声的要马。一面抱怨道：“早都不知做什么的，这会子寻趁我。”一面又骂小子：“捆着手呢么？马也拉不来！”要打发小厮去，又恐怕后来对出来，说不得亲自走一趟，骑马去了。\n　　且说贾珍方要抽身进来，只见张道士站在傍边，陪笑说道：“论理，我不比别人，应该里头伺候：只因天气炎热，众位千金都出来了，法官不敢擅入，请爷的示下。恐老太太问，或要随喜那里，我只在这里伺候罢了。”贾珍知道，这张道士虽然是当日荣国公的替身，曾经先皇御口亲呼为“大幻仙人”，如今现掌道录司印，又是当今封为“终了真人”，现今王公藩镇都称为神仙，所以不敢轻慢。二则他又常往两个府里去，太太姑娘们都是见的。今见他如此说，便笑道：“咱们自己，你又说起这话来。再多说，我把你这胡子还揪了你的呢！还不跟我进来呢。”那道土呵呵的笑着，跟了贾珍进来。\n　　贾珍到贾母跟前，控身陪笑，说道：“张爷爷进来请安。”贾母听了，忙道：“请他来。”贾珍忙去搀过来。那张道士先呵呵笑道：“无量寿佛！老祖宗一向福寿康宁，众位奶奶姑娘纳福！一向没到府里请安，老太太气色越发好了。”贾母笑道：“老神仙你好？”张道士笑道：“托老太太的万福，小道也还康健。别的倒罢了，只记挂着哥儿，一向身上好？前日四月二十六，我这里做遮天大五的圣诞，人也来的少，东西也很干净，我说请哥儿来逛逛，怎么说不在家？”贾母说道：“果真不在家。”一面回头叫宝玉。\n　　谁知宝玉解手儿去了，才来，忙上前问：“张爷爷好！”张道士也抱住问了好，又向贾母笑道：“哥儿越发发福了。”贾母道：“他外头好，里头弱。又搭着他老子逼着他念书，生生儿的把个孩子逼出病来了。”张道士道：“前日我在好几处看见哥儿写的字，做的诗，都好的了不得。怎么老爷还抱怨哥儿不大喜欢念书呢？依小道看来，也就罢了。”又叹道：“我看见哥儿的这个形容身段，言谈举动，怎么就和当日国公爷一个稿子！”说着两眼酸酸的。贾母听了，也由不得有些戚惨，说道：“正是呢。我养了这些儿子孙子，也没一个象他爷爷的，就只这玉儿还象他爷爷。”那道士又向贾珍道：“当日国公爷的模样儿，爷们一辈儿的不用说了，自然没赶上；大约连大老爷、二老爷也记不清楚了罢？”说毕，又呵呵大笑道：“前日在一个人家儿，看见位小姐，今年十五岁了，长的倒也好个模样儿。我想着哥儿也该提亲了。要论这小姐的模样儿，聪明智慧，根基家当，倒也配的过。但不知老太太怎么样？小道也不敢造次。等请了示下，才敢提去呢。”贾母道：“上回有个和尚说了，这孩子命里不该早娶，等再大一大儿再定罢。你如今也讯听着，不管他根基富贵，只要摸样儿配的上，就来告诉我。就是那家子穷，也不过帮他几两银子就完了。只是模样儿性格儿难得好的。”\n　　说毕，只见凤姐儿笑道：“张爷爷，我们丫头的寄名符儿你也不换去，前儿亏你还有那么大脸，打发人和我要鹅黄缎子去！要不给你，又恐怕你那老脸上下不来。”张道士哈哈大笑道：“你瞧，我眼花了！也没见奶奶在这里，也没道谢。寄名符早已有了，前日原想送去，不承望娘娘来做好事，也就混忘了。还在佛前镇着呢。等着我取了来。”说着跑到大殿上，一时拿了个茶盘，搭着大红蟒缎经袱子，托出符来。大姐儿的奶子接了符。张道士才要抱过大姐儿来，只见凤姐笑道：“你就手里拿出来罢了，又拿个盘子托着！”张道士道：“手里不干不净的，怎么拿？用盘子洁些。”凤姐笑道：“你只顾拿出盘子，倒唬了我一跳。我不说你是为送符，倒象和我们化布施来了。”众人听说哄然一笑，连贾珍也掌不住笑了。贾母回头道：“猴儿，猴儿！你不怕下割舌地狱？”凤姐笑道：“我们爷儿们不相干。他怎么常常的说我该积阴骘，迟了就短命呢？”张道士也笑道：“我拿出盘子来，一举两用，倒不为化布施，倒要把哥儿的那块玉请下来，托出去给那些远来的道友和徒子徒孙们见识见识。”贾母道：“既这么着，你老人家老天拔地的，跑什么呢，带着他去瞧了叫他进来，就是了。”张道士道：“老太太不知道，看着小道是八十岁的人，托老太太的福，倒还硬朗；二则外头的人多气味难闻，况且大暑热的天，哥儿受不惯，倘或哥儿中了腌气味，倒值多了。”\n　　贾母听说，便命宝玉摘下通灵玉来，放在盘内。那张道士兢兢业业的用蟒袱子垫着，捧出去了。\n　　这里贾母带着众人各处游玩一回，方去上楼。只见贾珍回说：“张爷爷送了玉来。”刚说着，张道士捧着盘子走到跟前，笑道：“众人托小道的福，见了哥儿的玉，实在稀罕，都没什么敬贺的，这是他们各人传道的法器，都愿意为敬贺之礼。虽不稀罕，哥儿只留着玩耍赏人罢。”贾母听说，向盘内看时，只见也有金璜，也有玉块，或有“事事如意”，或有“岁岁平安”，皆是珠穿宝嵌、玉琢金镂，共有三五十件。因说道：“你也胡闹。他们出家人，是那里来的？何必这样？这断不能收。”张道士笑道：“这是他们一点敬意，小道也不能阻挡。老太太要不留下，倒叫他们看着小道微薄，不象是门下出身了。”贾母听如此说，方命人接下了。宝玉笑道：“老太太，张爷爷既这么说，又推辞不得，我要这个也无用，不如叫小子捧了这个，跟着我出去散给穷人罢。”贾母笑道：“这话说的也是。”张道士忙拦道：“哥儿虽要行好，但这些东西虽说不甚稀罕，也到底是几件器皿。若给了穷人，一则与他们无益，二则反倒遭塌了这些东西。要舍给穷人，何不就散钱给他们呢？”宝玉听说，便命：“收下，等晚上拿钱施舍罢。”说毕，张道士方才退出。\n　　这里贾母和众人上了楼，在正面楼上归坐。凤姐等上了东楼。众丫头等在西楼轮流伺候。一时贾珍上来回道：“神前拈了戏，头一本是《白蛇记》。”贾母便问：“是什么故事？”贾珍道：“汉高祖斩蛇起首的故事。第二本是《满床笏》。”贾母点头道：“倒是第二本也还罢了。神佛既这样，也只得如此。”又问：“第三本？”贾珍道：“第三本是《南柯梦》。”贾母听了，便不言语。贾珍退下来，走至外边，预备着申表、焚钱粮、开戏，不在话下。\n　　且说宝玉在楼上，坐在贾母傍边，因叫个小丫头子捧着方才那一盘子东西，将自己的玉带上，用手翻弄寻拨，件一件的挑与贾母看。贾母因看见有个赤金点翠的麒麟，便伸手拿起来，笑道：“这件东西，好象是我看见谁家的孩子也带着一个。”宝钗笑道：“史大妹妹有一个，比这小些。”贾母道：“原来是云儿有这个。”宝玉道：“他这么往我们家去住着，我也没看见？”探春笑道：“宝姐姐有心，不管什么他都记得。”黛玉冷笑道：“他在别的上头心还有限，惟有这些人带的东西上，他才是留心呢。”宝钗听说，回头装没听见。宝玉听见史湘云有这件东西，自己便将那麒麟忙拿起来，揣在怀里。忽又想到怕人看见他听是史湘云有了，他就留着这件，因此手里揣着，却拿眼睛瞟人。只见众人倒都不理论，惟有黛玉瞅着他点头儿，似有赞叹之意。宝玉心里不觉没意思起来，又掏出来，瞅着黛玉讪笑道：“这个东西有趣儿，我替你拿着，到家里穿上个穗子你带，好不好？”黛玉将头一扭道：“我不稀罕。”宝玉笑道：“你既不稀罕，我可就拿着了。”说着，又揣起来。\n　　刚要悦话，只见贾珍之妻尤氏和贾蓉续娶的媳妇胡氏，婆媳两个来了，见过贾母。贾母道：“你们又来做什么，我不过没事来逛逛。”一句话说了，只见人报：“冯将军家有人来了。”原来冯紫英家听见贾府在庙里打醮，连忙预备猪羊，香烛、茶食之类，赶来送礼。凤姐听了，忙赶过正楼来，拍手笑道：“嗳呀！我却没防着这个。只说咱们娘儿们来闲逛逛，人家只当咱们大摆斋坛的来送礼。都是老太太闹的！这又不得预备赏封儿。”刚说了，只见冯家的两个管家女人上楼来了。冯家两个未去，接着赵侍郎家也有礼来了。于是接二连三，都听见贾府打醮，女眷都在庙里，凡一应远亲近友，世家相与，都来送礼。贾母才后悔起来，说：“又不是什么正经斋事，我们不过闲逛逛，没的惊动人。”因此虽看了一天戏，至下午便回来了。次日便懒怠去。凤姐又说：“‘打墙也是动土’，已经惊动了人，今儿乐得还去逛逛。”贾母因昨日见张道士提起宝玉说亲的事来，谁知宝玉一日心中不自在，回家来生气，嗔着张道士与他说了亲，一口声声说“从今以后，再不见张道士了”，别人也并不知为什么原故。二则黛玉昨日回家，又中了暑。因此二事，贾母便执意不去了。凤姐见不去，自己带了人去，也不在话下。\n　　且说宝玉因见黛玉病了，心里放不下，饭也懒怠吃，不时来问，只怕他有个好歹。黛玉因说道：“你只管听你的戏去罢，在家里做什么？”宝玉因昨日张道士提亲之事，心中大不受用，今听见黛玉如此说，心里因想道：“别人不知道我的心还可恕，连他也奚落起我来。”因此心中更比往日的烦恼加了百倍。要是别人跟前断不能动这肝火，只是黛玉说了这话，倒又比往日别人说这话不同，由不得立刻沉下脸来，说道：“我白认得你了！罢了，罢了！”黛玉听说，冷笑了两声道：“你白认得了我吗？我那里能够象人家有什么配的上你的呢！”宝玉听了，便走来，直问到脸上道：”你这么说，是安心咒我天诛地灭？”黛玉一时解不过这话来。宝玉又道：“昨儿还为这个起了誓呢，今儿你到底儿又重我一句！我就天诛地灭，你又有什么益处呢？”黛玉一闻此言，方想起昨日的话来。今日原自己错了，又是急，又是愧，便抽抽搭搭的哭起来，说道：“我要安心咒你，我也天诛地灭！何苦来呢！我知道昨日张道士说亲，你拍拦了你的好姻缘，你心里生气，来拿我煞性子！”\n　　原来宝玉自幼生成来的有一种下流痴病，况从幼时和黛玉耳鬓厮磨，心情相对，如今稍知些事，又看了些邪书僻传，凡远亲近友之家所见的那些闺英闱秀，皆未有稍及黛玉者，所以早存一段心事，只不好说出来。故每每或喜或怒，变尽法子暗中试探。那黛玉偏生也是个有些痴病的，也每用假情试探。因你也将真心真意瞒起来，我也将真心真意瞒起来，都只用假意试探，如此“两假相逢，终有一真”，其间琐琐碎碎，难保不有口角之事。即如此刻，宝玉的心内想的是：“别人不知我的心还可恕，难道你就不想我的心里眼里只有你？你不能为我解烦恼，反来拿这个话堵噎我，可见我心里时时刻刻白有你，你心里竟没我了。”宝玉是这个意思，只口里说不出来。那黛玉心里想着：“你心里自然有我，虽有‘金玉相对’之说，你岂是重这邪说不重人的呢？我就时常提这‘金玉’，你只管了然无闻的，方见的是待我重，无毫发私心了。怎么我只一提‘金玉’的事，你就着急呢？可知你心里时时有这个‘金玉’的念头。我一提，你怕我多心，故意着急，安心哄我。”那宝玉心中又想着：“我不管怎么样都好，只要你随意，我就立刻因你死了，也是情愿的。你知也罢，不知也罢，只由我的心，那才是你和我近，不和我远。”黛玉心里又想着：“你只管你就是了。你好，我自然好。你要把自己丢开，只管周旋我，是你不叫我近你，竟叫我远了。”\n　　看官，你道两个人原是一个心，如此看来，却都是多生了枝叶，将那求近之心反弄成疏远之意了。此皆他二人素昔所存私心，难以备述。如今只说他们外面的形容。那宝玉又听见地说“好姻缘”三个字，越发逆了己意。心里干噎，口里说不出来，便赌气向颈上摘下通灵玉来，咬咬牙，狠命往地下一摔，道：“什么劳什子！我砸了你，就完了事了！”偏生那玉坚硬非常，摔了一下，竟文风不动。宝玉见不破，便回身找东西来砸。黛玉见他如此，早已哭起来，说道：“何苦来你砸那哑吧东西？有砸他的，不如来砸我！”\n　　二人闹着，紫鹃、雪雁等忙来解劝。后来见宝玉下死劲的砸那玉，忙上来夺，又夺不下来。见比往日闹的大了，少不得去叫袭人。袭人忙赶了来，才夺下来。宝玉冷笑道：“我是砸我的东西，与你们什么相干！”袭人见他脸都气黄了，眉眼都变了，从来没气的这么样，便拉着他的手，笑道：“你合妹妹拌嘴，不犯着砸他；倘或砸坏了，叫他心里脸上怎么过的去呢！”黛玉一行哭着，一行听了这话，说到自己心坎儿上来，可见宝玉连袭人不如，越发伤心大哭起来。心里一急，方才吃的香薷饮，便承受不住，“哇”的一声，都吐出来了。紫鹃忙上来用绢子接住，登时一口一口的，把块绢子吐湿。雪雁忙上来捶揉。紫鹃道：“虽然生气，姑娘到底也该保重些。才吃了药，好些儿，这会子和宝二爷拌嘴，又吐出来了；倘或犯了病，宝二爷怎么心里过的去呢？”宝玉听了这话，说到自己心坎儿上来，可见黛玉竟还不如紫鹃呢。又见黛玉脸红头胀，一行啼哭，一行气凑，一行是泪，一行是汗，不胜怯弱。宝玉见了这般，又自己后悔：“方才不该和他较证，这会子他这样光景，我又替不了他。”心里想着，也由不得滴下泪来了。\n袭人守着宝玉，见他两个哭的悲痛，也心酸起来。又摸着宝玉的手冰凉，要劝宝玉不哭罢，一则恐宝玉有委屈闷在心里，二则又恐薄了黛玉，两头儿为难。正是女儿家的心性，不觉也流下泪来。紫鹃一面收拾了吐的药，一面拿扇子替黛玉轻轻的扇着，见三个人都鸦雀无声，各自哭各自的，索性也伤起心来，也拿着绢子拭泪。四个人都无言对泣。还是袭人勉强笑向宝玉道：“你不看别的，你看看这玉上穿的穗子，也不该和林姑娘拌嘴呀。”黛玉听了，也不顾病，赶来夺过去，顺手抓起一把剪子来就铰。袭人、紫鹃刚要夺，已经剪了几段。黛玉哭道：“我也是白效力，他也不稀罕，自有别人替他再穿好的去呢！”袭人忙接了玉道：“何苦来！这是我才多嘴的不是了。”宝玉向黛玉道：“你只管铰！我横竖不带他，也没什么。只顾里头闹，谁知那些老婆子们见黛玉大哭大吐，宝玉又砸玉，不知道要闹到什么田地儿，便连忙的一齐往前头去回了贾母、王夫人知道，好不至于连累了他们。那贾母、王夫人见他们忙忙的做一件正经事来告诉，也都不知有了什么原故，便一齐进园来瞧。急的袭人抱怨紫鹃：“为什么惊动了老太太、太太？”紫鹃又只当是袭人着人去告诉的，也抱怨袭人。那贾母、王夫人进来，见宝玉也无言，黛玉也无话，问起来，又没为什么事，便将这祸移到袭人、紫鹃两个人身上，说：“为什么你们不小心伏侍，这会子闹起来都不管呢！”因此将二人连骂带说教训了一顿。二人都没的说，只得听着。还是贾母带出宝玉去了，方才平伏。\n    过了一日，至初三日，乃是薛蟠生日，家里摆酒唱戏，贾府诸人都去了。宝玉因得罪了黛玉，二人总未见面，心中正自后悔，无精打彩，那里还有心肠去看戏，因而推病不去。黛玉不过前日中了些暑褥之气，本无甚大病，听见他不去，心里想：“他是好吃酒听戏的，今日反不去，自然是因为昨儿气着了；再不然他见我不去，他也没心肠去。只是昨儿千不该万不该铰了那玉上的穗子。管定他再不带了，还得我穿了他才带。”因而心中十分后悔。那贾母见他两个都生气，只说趁今儿那边去看戏，他两个见了，也就完了，不想又都不去。老人家急的抱怨说：“我这老冤家，是那一世里造下的孽障？偏偏儿的遇见了这么两个不懂事的小冤家儿，没有一天不叫我操心！真真的是俗语儿说的，‘不是冤家不聚头’了。几时我闭了眼，断了这口气，任凭你们两个冤家闹上天去，我‘眼不见，心不烦’也就罢了。偏他娘的又不咽这口气！”自己抱怨着，也哭起来了。谁知这个话传到宝玉、黛玉二人耳内，他二人竟从来没有听见过“不是冤家不聚头”的这句俗话儿，如今忽然得了这句话，好似参禅的一般，都低着头细嚼这句话的滋味儿，不觉的潸然泪下。虽然不曾会面，却一个在潇湘馆临风洒泪，一个在怡红院对月长吁，正是“人居两地，情发一心”了。袭人因劝宝玉道：“千万不是，都是你的不是。往日家里的小厮们和他的姐姐妹妹拌嘴，或是两口子分争，你要是听见了，还骂那些小厮们蠢，不能体贴女孩儿们的心肠，今儿怎么你也这么着起来了。明儿初五，大节下的，你们两个再这么仇人似的，老太太越发要生气了，一定弄的大家不安生。依我劝你，正经下个气儿，赔个不是，大家还是照常一样儿的，这么着不好吗？”宝玉听了，不知依与不依。\n要知端详，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Baoyu was staring blankly in front of him when Daiyu, meaning to toss her handkerchief at him, accidentally hit him in the eye. He gave a start.\n\n“Who’s that?” he cried.\n\nDaiyu shook her head. “Sorry, it was an accident,” she giggled. “Cousin Baochai wanted to see the gawping goose, and I was showing her when my hand slipped.”\n\nBaoyu rubbed his eye but could think of nothing to say.\n\nJust then Xifeng arrived and invited them all to the Taoist temple on the first to watch operas. Baochai declined.\n\n“It’s too hot,” she said. “And there’s no opera I haven’t seen before.”\n\n“It’s cool there with pavilions on both sides,” Xifeng told her. “If we go, I’ll send servants a few days in advance to clear all the Taoists out of the place and have the upstairs rooms swept and hung with blinds. No outsiders will be allowed in the temple. That will be all right, won’t it? I’ve already reported this to Lady Wang. If you won’t come, I shall go by myself. I’ve been so bored these last few days, and when they put on operas at home I never have a chance to watch them in comfort.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager laughed.\n“In that case I’ll go with you.”\n“If Your Ladyship comes too, that will be wonderful!” cried Xifeng. “Only I shan’t enjoy myself so much.”\n\n“We’ll put you in the other pavilion across from mine. You needn’t come over to pay your respects to me. Will that suit you?”\n\n“That shows how good you are to me, Old Ancestress.” Xifeng turned to Baochai. “Do come, and your mother too. It’s a long summer day, you’d only sleep at home.”\n\nBaochai had to agree.\n\nThe Lady Dowager sent to invite Aunt Xue and told Lady Wang on the way to take the young people too. But Lady Wang, who was unwell and expecting some word from the Palace about Yuanchun, had already declined. She said with a smile:\n\n“How high-spirited the old lady is! Tell the girls that any of them who want to can go with her on the first.”\n\nWhen this message reached the inner apartments, the maids — who were cooped up indoors day after day and seldom had a chance to go out — were naturally all eager to go. Even those whose mistresses would not be going urged them to change their minds. So Li Wan and the rest decided to go too. This delighted the Lady Dowager, who ordered the servants to make all preparations. But no more of this.\n\nWhen the first of the month arrived, carriages and horses stood thick outside the Rong Mansion. The attendants, knowing that the Imperial Consort had sponsored this mass and that the Lady Dowager was going to offer incense on the festival, had made more elaborate preparations than usual. Presently the ladies emerged. The Lady Dowager rode in a large sedan-chair carried by eight bearers, while Li Wan, Xifeng and Aunt Xue had four-bearer sedans. Baochai and Daiyu shared a carriage with a kingfisher-blue awning and embroidered curtains. Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun had one with a red wheel-cover and kingfisher-blue awning. Then came the maids. The Lady Dowager’s personal maids Yuanyang, Yingwu, Hupo and Zhenzhu; Daiyu’s Zijuan, Xueyan and Yinger; Baochai’s Yinger and Wenxing; Yingchun’s Siqi and Xiuju; Tanchun’s Shishu and Cuimo; Xichun’s Ruhua and Caiping; Aunt Xue’s Tongxi and Tonggui, together with Xiangling and her maid Zhen’er; Li Wan’s Suyun and Biyue; Xifeng’s Pinger, Feng’er and Xiaohong, as well as Lady Wang’s two maids Jinchuan and Caiyun who had accompanied Xifeng. Their nurses followed with Dame Liu in another carriage, and after them several other serving-women and maids.\n\nThe street was packed with carriages. When people saw that this was the Lady Dowager’s procession going to offer incense, they lined the road to watch. And women in the small households by the way opened their doors and stood in their gateways chattering and gesticulating as if this were some public show.\n\nFirst came the outriders and attendants in full state. Then a young gentleman on a fine white horse with a silver saddle, coloured bridle and scarlet tassels, riding ahead of an eight-man scarlet sedan-chair. This was followed by carriages, more sedans, horsemen and attendants — a magnificent stream of splendid equipage and fragrant smoke, enough to blot out the sky and earth. But the only sounds to break the silence were the hoof-beats of horses and the rumble of wheels.\n\nSoon they reached the Temple of the Immortal. Bells and drums sounded as the Taoist abbot Chang, holding incense and draped in a cope, came out with all his priests to meet them. Pao-yu dismounted. The Lady Dowager’s chair was carried through the main gate, and at the sight of the local god’s image she ordered the bearers to halt. Chia Chen came with the other men of the family to welcome her. His-feng’s chair, which had gone ahead, had already arrived. Assisted by Yuan-yang and the rest, she came forward to help the old lady alight. Just then a young acolyte of twelve or thirteen who was trimming the candles in a candelabrum with a pair of snuffers, hoping to slip out unobserved, ran headlong into His-feng. She slapped his face so hard that the boy staggered.\n\n“Little bastard!” she swore. “Where are you bolting to?”\n\nThe acolyte picked himself up and fled without stopping to retrieve his snuffers. And as he scuttled out, Pao-chai and the other girls were alighting from their carriages, surrounded by matrons and maids. At the sight of this young Taoist rolling out they cried:\n\n“Catch him! Beat him!”\n\nThe Lady Dowager heard this and asked what was happening. When Chia Chen went over to find out, His-feng stepped forward to support the old lady.\n\n“A young acolyte who was trimming the candles tried to dodge away and lost his head,” she reported.\n\n“Don’t frighten the poor child,” said the Lady Dowager immediately. “Bring him here. What does a child from a poor family know of such style and splendour? If he’s scared out of his wits, poor little mite, his parents are sure to be heartbroken.”\n\nShe ordered Chia Chen to bring the boy to her. He had to go to fetch him. The child was kneeling on the ground trembling, the snuffers still in his hand. The Lady Dowager ordered Chia Chen to make him stand up and not frighten him, then asked him how old he was.\n\nThe boy was speechless.\n\n“Poor thing,” exclaimed the old lady, and told Chia Chen, “Take him away and give him some cash to buy himself sweets. Mind no one bullies him.”\n\nChia Chen assented and led him out.\n\nThe Lady Dowager with her party then went on to inspect the different shrines and halls. Meanwhile the pages outside, having seen the old lady enter the second gate, observed Chia Chen leading out the acolyte.\n\n“Take this boy and give him a few hundred cash,” Chia Chen ordered. “See that no one ill-treats him.”\n\nAt once some servants came up to do his bidding.\n\nChia Chen, standing on the steps, asked, “Where is the steward?”\n\n“Here!” shouted the pages in the court below.\n\nAt once Lin Chih-hsiao, smoothing his hair and adjusting his hat, ran up to Chia Chen.\n\n“Although this is a big place,” said Chia Chen, “we’ve a large party today. Keep the servants you need here and send the rest to the other courtyards. Post a good number of pages at this second gate and the side gates to pass on orders and fetch things. Do you understand? The young ladies and mistresses are here today; no outsiders are to be admitted.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” answered Lin Chih-hsiao promptly. “Very good, sir.”\n\n“Off with you, then.”\n\nHe asked, “Why isn’t Rong here?” Before the words were out of his mouth, Jia Rong came running down from the bell-tower.\n\n“Look at that!” cried Jia Zhen. “I’m sweltering here while he cools himself down.”\n\nHe ordered a servant to spit at him. Knowing his arbitrary temper, the servants dared not disobey. One of them stepped forward and spat in Jia Rong’s face. Then, as Jia Zhen was glaring at the young man, the servant asked him:\n\n“Why aren’t you afraid of the heat, sir, while the young master goes off to cool down?”\n\nJia Rong, not daring to say a word, stood with his hands at his sides. But Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Jia Qin, Jia Lian, Jia Qiong and the others were so alarmed by this that they hastily and stealthily scrambled down from the foot of the wall.\n\nJia Zhen snapped at Jia Rong, “What are you standing there for? Why aren’t you on horseback, racing home to tell your mother and the rest that the old lady and the young ladies have all come? They must come at once to wait on them.”\n\nJia Rong promptly rushed out, shouting for his horse. Grumbling, “I don’t know what they were up to earlier, but now they take it out on me,” he swore at the servants, “Have your hands been tied? Why haven’t you brought my horse?” He considered sending a servant with the message, but feared that if this were discovered later he would be in trouble. So he had to go himself and rode off.\n\nJia Zhen was turning to go back when he noticed Zhang the Taoist standing beside him.\n\n“By rights, not being an outsider, I should serve inside,” said the priest with a smile. “But as it’s so hot and all the young ladies are out, I don’t like to intrude without instructions. I’ll wait here, in case the old lady wants me to accompany her somewhere.”\n\nJia Zhen knew that this Zhang the Taoist had been nominated by the former Emperor as the Great Illusion Immortal, and that he was now the head of the Taoist registry in the capital. The present Emperor had honoured him with the title of Perfect Man, and all the princes and nobles referred to him as an immortal; so Jia Zhen did not treat him like an ordinary priest. Besides, he was a frequent visitor to both mansions and all the ladies had met him.\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense,” Jia Zhen replied with a smile. “If you say any more, I’ll pull that beard of yours. Come along with me.” Chuckling, the priest followed him inside.\n\nJia Zhen went up to the Lady Dowager and said with a smile, “Grandad Zhang has come to pay his respects.”\n\n“Fetch him in,” she said at once.\n\nJia Zhen went out to fetch him in, and the priest greeted her with a chuckle.\n\n“Buddha of Infinite Longevity!” he cried. “How are you, Ancestress? Are all your ladies well? I haven’t been to the house to pay my respects for some time, but you’re looking even fitter than before.”\n\n“I’m well, Old Immortal,” she answered.\n\n“Thanks to your good luck, madam, this humble priest is also well. The only thing is, I’ve been worrying about the young master. Is he better? On the twenty-sixth of last month, for the celebration of the King of Heaven’s birthday, we didn’t have too many people and everything was very clean. I wanted to ask the young master over, but I was told he wasn’t at home.”\n\n“He really was out,” she said, and turned to look for Baoyu.\n\nHe had just come back after relieving himself and stepped forward now to greet the priest, who clasped him in his arms.\n\n“He’s growing stouter,” he told the Lady Dowager with a smile.\n\n“He looks all right outside, but he’s weak inside,” she said. “And on top of that, his father makes him study so hard that the poor child’s falling ill.”\n\n“I saw some calligraphy and poems of his the other day in several different places,” said Zhang the Taoist. “They were really excellent. So how can his Lordship complain that he doesn’t like studying? In my humble opinion, that’s going a bit too far.” He sighed.\n\n“I was thinking,” he remarked, “the young master’s features, figure and way of talking and moving are the very image of his grandfather, the old Duke of Jungkuo.” His eyes as he spoke were brimming with tears.\n\nThe Lady Dowager too was much affected.\n\n“You’re right,” she said. “I’ve sons and grandsons, but not one takes after his grandfather. Just this Yu takes after him.”\n\nThe Taoist turned to Chia Chen.\n\n“None of the gentlemen of your generation, sir, could have known the old Duke, of course. But I doubt if even the Elder Master and the Second Master can have a clear recollection of him.” He chuckled. “The other day at someone’s house I saw a young lady of fifteen. She’s quite pretty, and it occurred to me that the young master here should be betrothed. In looks, intelligence and family background she’d be a suitable match. But I don’t know what Your Ladyship would think. I wouldn’t like to act too hastily without your instructions.”\n\n“Some time ago a monk advised us not to have him betrothed too early,” she replied. “We’d better wait till he’s a little older. But do keep your ears open for us. So long as the girl is good-looking and comes from a decent family, it doesn’t matter if she’s poor. We can always help them out with a few taels. The main thing is that she should have a good character and looks.”\n\nJust then Hsi-feng joined in.\n\n“Grandad Chang, you still haven’t changed our girl’s amulet for her. The other day, for shame, you had the check to send to my place for some yellow satin. If I hadn’t given it, you’d have lost face.”\n\nChang laughed heartily.\n\n“Look at that!” he cried. “My eyes are so dim, I didn’t see you here, madam, or thank you for the satin. The amulet’s ready. I meant to send it the other day, but then Her Grace’s Mass made me forget. It’s still before the Buddha. I’ll go and fetch it.”\n\nHe hurried to the main hall and soon came back with a tea-tray covered with a red satin dragon-embroidered cloth on which lay the amulet. The nurse in charge of Ta-chieh took it.\n\nAs Chang was about to pick up the child, Hsi-feng said with a smile:\n\n“You could have just brought it in your hand. Why use a tray?”\n\n“My hands are none too clean. A tray seemed more respectful.”\n\n“You gave me quite a start, bringing it in on a tray. I thought you’d come to ask for alms.”\n\nAt that everyone laughed, even Chia Chen.\n\n“You monkey!” cried the old lady. “Aren’t you afraid of going to the tongue-pulling hell?”\n\n“We’re on good terms,” retorted Hsi-feng. “He often tells me I should do more good works or I’ll die young.”\n\n“That’s why I brought the tray,” chuckled Chang. “Not to ask for alms but to request the young master’s jade to show my disciples and those who’ve come from afar.”\n\n“In that case, why trouble to go yourself at your age?” asked the Lady Dowager. “Just send someone with him to have a look, then bring him back.”\n\n“You don’t realize, madam, that though I’m eighty, thanks to your good fortune I’m still hale and hearty. Besides, there’s such a crowd out there and the air is so foul in this heat, the young master might find it too much. If he were to catch some illness, that would be serious.”\n\nSo the Lady Dowager made Pao-yu take off his jade and put it on the tray, which Chang carefully carried out, resting it on the dragon-embroidered cloth.\n\nThe old lady then took the rest of the party to see something of the temple before going upstairs. Presently Chia Chen came to report:\n\n“The Reverend Zhang has brought the jade back.” As she spoke the Taoist came up to them, holding the tray.\n\n“Thanks to me, the others have seen the young gentleman’s jade,” he said cheerfully. “They think it marvellous, but have nothing worthy to offer him in return. These are some of their religious vessels and they beg him to keep them as souvenirs. They’re nothing rare, of course, but the young gentleman can amuse himself with them or give them away as presents.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager saw that the tray was filled with such trinkets as gold pendants and jade ornaments, some inscribed “All Your Wishes Fulfilled” or “Peace All Year Round,” all set with pearls and gems or worked in openwork and filigree, some thirty or fifty pieces in all.\n\n“This is most thoughtless of you,” she expostulated. “Those priests are strangers. There was no need for this. We certainly can’t accept.”\n\n“This is their humble tribute,” he replied. “I couldn’t very well stop them. If you refuse to keep these things, madam, they’ll think I’m too unworthy to be considered one of your dependants.”\n\nAt that she told the servants to accept the tray.\n\n“Since Grandad Zhang says that, and we can’t very well refuse,” put in Baoyu, “I’ve no use for these things. Why not tell one of the pages to take them and distribute them among the poor outside?”\n\n“That’s a good idea,” approved his grandmother.\n\nBut the Taoist demurred, “Don’t be so charitable, young master. These may not be rare objects, still they are vessels of a kind. Giving them to the poor would be of no use to them and might lead to the things being damaged. If you want to give alms, better give the poor money.”\n\n“Very well,” said Baoyu. “Keep these until this evening, when I’ll give money instead.”\n\nOnly then did the Taoist withdraw.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and the rest now went up to the main balcony and took their seats there, while Xifeng and her party went to the east balcony. The maids waited on them in the west balcony.\n\nPresently Jia Zhen came up to report, “The plays chosen by divine lot are: first, The Story of the White Serpent.”\n\n“What’s the story?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“It’s about the First Emperor of Han killing a serpent before starting his uprising. The second is Beating the Empress’ Relative.”\n\nHis grandmother nodded. “Well, the second isn’t too bad. We’ll have to abide by the god’s choice. What’s the third?”\n\n“The third is the Dream of the Southern Tributary State.”\n\nThe old lady said nothing at that and Jia Zhen withdrew to see to the burning of paper offerings and the opening of the plays.\n\nBaoyu, sitting next to his grandmother in the balcony, had a young maid bring him the tray of gifts. Putting his own jade away, he fingered the trinkets one by one as he held them up for the Lady Dowager to see.\n\n“What’s this?” she exclaimed, catching sight of a unicorn sparkling with gold and kingfisher feathers. “It seems to me I’ve seen one of these on some child or other.”\n\n“Cousin Xiangyun has one, only smaller,” volunteered Baochai.\n\n“So Yun’s got one, has she?” remarked the Lady Dowager.\n\nBaoyu was surprised. “She’s stayed in our house all this time, but I never saw it.”\n\n“Cousin Baochai notices everything,” observed Tanchun.\n\n“She’s observant enough about other things too, but she’s most observant about what other people wear.” Daiyu gave a little sniff as she said this.\n\nBaochai turned her head away as if she had not heard.\n\nHearing that Xiangyun had a unicorn, Baoyu quickly slipped the one he was holding into his pouch. Then, afraid the others might have seen and think he had kept it because of Xiangyun, he stole a glance round. But apparently no one had noticed except Daiyu, who was watching him and nodding as if in approval. He felt rather embarrassed and sheepishly produced the unicorn again, showing it to Daiyu with a grin.\n\n\"This is a pretty thing. Let me keep it for you, and when we get home I’ll have a tassel attached so that you can wear it.\"\n\nDai-yu tossed her head. \"I wouldn’t care for it.\"\n\n\"In that case I’ll keep it myself.\" He grinned and tucked it into his clothes again.\n\nHe was about to say something else when Jia Zhen’s wife Madam You arrived with her daughter-in-law, Jia Rong’s second wife. Having paid their respects to the Lady Dowager, the latter asked:\n\n\"What have you come for? I’m just here to amuse myself.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a servant announced the arrival of some servants from General Feng’s household. Learning that the Jias were sacrificing in the temple, Feng Ziying had lost no time in preparing pigs, sheep, incense, candles and sweetmeats as gifts. When Xifeng heard this she hurried over.\n\n\"Aiya!\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"This took me by surprise. We came just for an outing, but people assume we’re sacrificing on a grand scale and are bringing gifts. This is all our Old Ancestress’ fault! Now we’ve nothing ready to tip the messengers with.\"\n\nEven as she was speaking, two stewards’ wives from the Feng family came up to their pavilion. And before they had left, the Zhao family sent gifts too. In fact, one after another, all their relatives and friends who heard that the ladies of the Jia family were sacrificing in the temple sent presents. The Lady Dowager was quite put out.\n\n\"This isn’t a formal sacrifice,\" she said. \"We just came for an outing. We shouldn’t have let people know.\"\n\nSo though they stayed to watch operas the whole morning, they went home that afternoon. And the next day the Lady Dowager was too tired to go again.\n\nXifeng however urged her, \"Since we’ve disturbed the earth by starting to build a wall, we may as well proceed — we’ve alerted people anyway. Why not go and enjoy ourselves?\"\n\nBut the old lady had another reason for refusing. The previous day, Abbot Zhang’s proposal of a match for Baoyu had upset the boy. He had come home in a temper, complaining that the abbot had made this suggestion and swearing that he would never set eyes on the man again. No one knew the reason for his aversion. Besides, Dai-yu had been overcome by the heat on her return and was unwell. For these two reasons, the Lady Dowager insisted on staying at home. Then Xifeng, having no such scruples, took some servants and went back to the temple. But no more of this.\n\nBaoyu was worried by Dai-yu’s illness and too concerned to have any appetite. He kept going to ask how she was, for fear she might be seriously ill.\n\n\"Why don’t you go to the opera?\" she asked. \"What do you want to stay at home for?\"\n\nBaoyu had been offended by Abbot Zhang’s proposal the previous day, and now her asking this — as he thought — sarcastically made him reflect, \"Other people may not know me, but she’s mocking me too.\" This increased his exasperation a hundredfold. Had the remark been made by anyone else he could have controlled his anger, but coming from Dai-yu it was the last straw. He replied coldly:\n\n\"I’ve known you all these years for nothing. That’s all there is to it.\"\n\nDai-yu gave a scornful laugh. \"Yes, you have known me all these years for nothing. I can’t compare with the others, with what they have to offer you.\"\n\nAt that he came closer to demand, \"Are you so set on cursing me that you want me to drop dead?\"\n\nFor a moment she could not take in his meaning.\n\n\"Didn’t I swear only yesterday?\" he cried. \"And now you accuse me again. If I’m to drop dead, what good will that do you?\"\n\nOnly then did Dai-yu remember their conversation the day before. She knew that she had been in the wrong and had spoken too hastily. This made her feel both flustered and ashamed. She sobbed:\n\n\"You may as well kill me. Yes, I’ve set my heart on cursing you. But why should I be blamed because Abbot Zhang made a proposal of marriage and you’re angry that your wonderful match was broken off, so that you come to take it out on me?\"\n\nSince childhood Baoyu had been peculiar in this respect. And having grown up as Daiyu’s close companion since her coming, he now felt closer to her than to all other girls. Having recently gained some understanding of love from certain books, he was surer than ever that no other girl could surpass her. But not venturing to bare his heart to her, he tried in devious ways to sound her out. And Daiyu, being equally eccentric, deliberately feigned indifference to test him. So it came about that, hiding their real feelings, they deceived each other with false ones. Yet in the course of this, owing to some carelessness, friction was bound to arise between them.\n\nThus Baoyu was reflecting now: “I wouldn’t mind if others didn’t understand me, but can it be you don’t? Don’t you know that I’ve no eyes for anyone but you? Instead of reassuring me you make these cutting remarks. It shows you don’t care for me. You’re always on my mind, but I’m not in your thoughts at all.”\n\nHe was too overcome to express this.\n\nDaiyu’s thoughts, on the other hand, were: “I’m sure I mean everything to you. Even if this talk of a match between gold and jade is true, you can’t prefer the gold to me. It shows how much you care for me and have no thought for anyone else if I harp on about the gold and jade and you take no notice. Why get so worked up the moment I mention it? That proves you’re worried about it and try to put me off by pretending to be upset.”\n\nBaoyu was reflecting again, “No matter what happens to me, I only want you to be happy. I’d gladly die for you this instant. If you realize that, so much the better. If not, I don’t care so long as you feel as I do. That will bring us closer.”\n\nAnd Daiyu was thinking, “You needn’t worry about me. Just look after yourself. If you’re all right, I shall be all right. But if you ignore your own feelings and keep thinking of me, that will estrange us.”\n\nAs the proverb says, “Lovers’ tiffs are the renewal of love.” And the more they tried to hide their feelings the more they irritated each other. So we need not dwell on all the foolish things they said.\n\nNow the words “good match” had upset Baoyu still more. Unable to vent his anger, he gritted his teeth, snatched the jade from his neck and dashed it to the ground.\n\n“Rotten stupid thing!” he cried. “I’ll smash you to bits and have done.”\n\nBut the jade was too hard to break. Though he dashed it fiercely to the floor, it remained intact.\n\nWhen he saw that it was not broken, Baoyu turned to look for something with which to smash it. Daiyu, in tears, sobbed:\n\n“Why smash that dumb, stupid thing? Instead of beating it, why not beat me?”\n\nTheir quarrel had brought Zijuan and Xueyan running to intervene, and now Zijuan tried to take the jade from Baoyu but could not wrest it from him. Seeing that this was a worse quarrel than usual, they had to send for Xiren, who hurried over and took the jade from him.\n\n“What business is it of yours if I smash my own thing?” he sneered.\n\nHis face was pale, his eyes stared wildly. Never had she seen him in such a rage.\n\n“If you’ve quarrelled with your cousin, that’s no reason to smash the jade,” she said soothingly, taking his hand. “Suppose you had broken it, how do you think she would have felt?”\n\nThese words, coming straight to the point, made Daiyu cry even more bitterly to think that Baoyu was less considerate than Xiren. Soon she was sobbing so violently that she was sick.\n\nJust then Zijuan brought the decoction of elsholtzia. But the moment Daiyu took it she retched and brought it all up again. Zijuan hastily held her handkerchief to Daiyu’s mouth until it was soaked, while Xueyan patted her mistress on the back.\n\n“I know you’re angry, miss,” said Zijuan, “but you should take care of yourself. You’d just taken some medicine and were a little better, but this squabble with Master Bao has made you bring it up again. If you have a relapse, however is he to blame himself?”\n\nThis reminded Baoyu that Daiyu was not as considerate as her maid. He saw how flushed she was, her hair dishevelled, as she cried and choked, tears and sweat streaming down her face. She looked so fragile, he regretted having crossed her.\n\n“I shouldn’t have argued with her,” he thought. “Now I’ve reduced her to this state, and there’s no way to take her suffering on myself.” He started crying too.\n\nXiren watching him was distressed by the sight of them both in tears. Finding Baoyu’s hands cold, she would have liked to urge him to control himself but was afraid that he might feel even more upset if he repressed his feelings or that this might slight Daiyu. So, being soft-hearted, she started crying too.\n\nZijuan, having cleared up the vomit, was gently fanning Daiyu. The silence of the other three, all weeping apart, so affected her that she dried her eyes with her handkerchief.\n\nSo there were the four of them crying, not a word exchanged between them. At last Xiren forced a smile.\n\n“If for no other reason,” she said to Baoyu, “just for the sake of the cord on your jade you shouldn’t quarrel with Miss Lin.”\n\nDaiyu snatched the jade away and, seizing a pair of scissors, cut off its cord in several strokes before Xiren and Zijuan could stop her.\n\n“I’ve worked for nothing,” she cried. “He doesn’t value it. Someone else will make him a better cord.”\n\nXiren hastily took the jade from her.\n\n“Why do that?” she asked. “This is all my fault for saying the wrong thing.”\n\n“Go on and cut it up,” Baoyu told Daiyu. “I don’t care if I never wear it again.”\n\nWhile this commotion was going on indoors, the old nannies outside had heard Daiyu crying, vomiting and sobbing, and Baoyu dashing his jade to the floor. Not knowing what trouble might come of it, they sent word at once to the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang so that they should not be held to blame. When these two learned that something serious had happened, they came at once to the Garden, to the great consternation of Xiren and Zijuan.\n\n“Why did you have to tell the old lady and the mistress?” Xiren demanded of Zijuan.\n\nBut Zijuan thought Xiren had sent word and blamed her.\n\nThe Lady Dowager and Lady Wang found Baoyu and Daiyu saying nothing, but when questioned they would not admit to any quarrel. So the two ladies turned on Xiren and Zijuan.\n\n“Why weren’t you looking after them properly?” they scolded. “Why didn’t you stop this squabble?” They gave the two maids a severe dressing-down which they had to listen to in silence. Not till the Lady Dowager carried Baoyu off was quiet restored.\n\nThe next day was the third of the month, Xue Pan’s birthday. There was wine and opera performances at his home, and all the Jia family went over. Baoyu had offended Daiyu and had not seen her since. He was feeling so remorseful and depressed that he had no heart to go to a play, so he pleaded illness. Daiyu was not seriously ill, only a little upset by the heat. When she heard that Baoyu was not going she thought, “He usually enjoys drinking and watching operas, but today he’s not going. Perhaps he’s angry with me still, or perhaps because I’m not going he doesn’t feel like it....”\n\nBut I should never have cut off the tassels. I’m sure he won’t wear it again unless I put on new ones for him.” She was filled with remorse.\n\nThe Lady Dowager, seeing that they were both upset, had hoped that going to the other house to watch the operas would bring them together again; but as neither would go she fumed:\n\n“What sin have I committed in a former life to be plagued with two such troublesome children in my old age? Not a day passes without something happening to worry me. It’s really true, as the saying goes, ‘Enemies and lovers are destined to meet.’ I shan’t have any peace until I’ve breathed my last and closed my eyes for good — then they can do as they please. But while I live I’ve no hope of a quiet life.” She broke down and wept.\n\nThese complaints reached the ears of Baoyu and Daiyu. They had never heard the saying “Enemies and lovers are destined to meet,” and it struck them like a Zen Buddhist riddle. They lowered their heads to mull it over and, in spite of themselves, burst into tears. Although not together, each was weeping to the wind in one place and sighing to the moon in another. Truly:\n\nThough apart.\n\nThey shared one heart.\n\nXiren tried to console Baoyu. “It’s entirely your fault on this festival,” she said. “I’ve often heard you scold the pages here for being too stupid to know how to humour girls, when you heard them squabbling with their sisters or sweethearts. How come you’re as bad as they are today? Tomorrow, the fifth, is this great festival. If you two go on scowling at each other like enemies, the old lady will be even more upset. Do make an effort to patch things up. Wouldn’t that be better for everyone?”\n\nWhether Baoyu took her advice or not will be seen in the next chapter."
