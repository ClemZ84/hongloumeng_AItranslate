  "original": "话说邢、王二夫人听尤氏一段话，明知也难挽回。王夫人只得说道：“姑娘要行善，这也是前生的夙根，我们也实在拦不住。只是咱们这样人家的姑娘出了家，不成个事体。如今你嫂子说了，准你修行，也是好处。却有一句话要说，那头发可以不剃的，只要自己的心真，那在头发上头呢？你想妙玉也是带发修行的。不知他怎样凡心一动，才闹到那个分儿。姑娘执意如此，我们就把姑娘住的房子便算了姑娘的静室。所有服侍姑娘的人，也得叫他们来问。他若愿意跟的，就讲不得说亲配人；若不愿意跟的，另打主意。”惜春听了，收了泪，拜谢了邢、王二夫人、李纨、尤氏等。王夫人说了，便问彩屏等：“谁愿跟姑娘修行？”彩屏等回道：“太太们派谁就是谁。”\n　　王夫人知道不愿意，正在想人。袭人立在宝玉身后，想来宝玉必要大哭，防着他的旧病。岂知宝玉叹道：“真真难得！”袭人心里更自伤悲。宝钗虽不言语，遇事试探，见他执迷不醒，只得暗中落泪。王夫人才要叫了众丫头来问，忽见紫鹃走上前去，在王夫人面前跪下，回道：“刚才太太问跟四姑娘的姐姐，太太看着怎么样？”王夫人道：“这个如何强派得人的？谁愿意，他自然就说出来了。”紫鹃道：“姑娘修行，自然姑娘愿意，并不是别的姐姐们的意思。我有句话回太太，我也并不是拆开姐姐们，各人有各人的心。我服侍林姑娘一场，林姑娘待我也是太太们知道的，实在恩重如山，无以可报。他死了，我恨不得跟了他去，但只他不是这里的人，我又受主子家的恩典，难以从死。如今四姑娘既要修行，我就求太太们将我派了跟着姑娘，伏侍姑娘一辈子，不知太太们准不准？若准了，就是我的造化了。”邢、王二夫人尚未答言，只见宝玉听到那里，想起黛玉，一阵心酸，眼泪早下来了。众人才要问他时，他又哈哈的大笑，走上来道：“我不该说的。这紫鹃蒙太太派给我屋里，我才敢说：求太太准了他罢，全了他的好心。”王夫人道：“你头里姊妹出了嫁，还哭得死去活来，如今看见四妹妹要出家，不但不劝，倒说‘好事’，你如今到底是怎么个意思？我索性不明白了。”宝玉道：“四妹妹修行是已经准了的，四妹妹也是一定的主意了？若是真呢，我有一句话告诉太太：若是不定呢，我就不敢混说了。”惜春道：“二哥哥说话也好笑，一个人主意不定，便扭得过太太们来了？我也是象紫鹃的话，容我呢，是我的造化，不容我呢还有一个死呢，那怕什么。二哥哥既有话，只管说。”宝玉道：“我这也不算什么泄漏了，这也是一定的。我念一首诗给你们听听罢。”众人道：“人家苦得很的时候，你倒来做诗怄人。”宝玉道：“不是做诗，我到过一个地方儿看了来的。你们听听罢。”众人道：“使得。你就念念，别顺着嘴儿胡诌。”宝玉也不分辩，便说道：\n　　勘破三春景不长，缁衣顿改昔年妆。\n　　可怜绣户侯门女，独卧青灯古佛旁。\n　　李纨、宝钗听了，诧异道：“不好了！这个人入了魔了。”王夫人听了这话，点头叹息，便问：“宝玉，你到底是那里看来的？”宝玉不便说出来，回道：“太太也不必问我，自有见的地方。”王夫人回过味来，细细一想，便更哭起来道：“你说前儿是玩话，怎么忽然有这首诗？罢了，我知道了。你们叫我怎么样呢？我也没有法儿了，也只得由着你们去罢，但只等我合上了眼，各自干各自的就完了！”\n　　宝钗一面劝着，这个心比刀绞更甚，也掌不住，便放声大哭起来。袭人已经哭的死去活来，幸亏秋纹扶着。宝玉也不啼哭，也不相劝，只不言语。贾兰、贾环听到那里，各自走开。李纨竭力的解说：“总是宝兄弟见四妹妹修行，他想来是痛极了，不顾前后的疯话，这也作不得准。独有紫鹃的事情，准不准，好叫他起来。”王夫人道：“什么依不依？横竖一个人的主意定了，那也是扭不过来的。可是宝玉说的，也是一定的了！”紫鹃听了磕头。惜春又谢了王夫人。紫鹃又给宝玉、宝钗磕了头，宝玉念声：“阿弥陀佛！难得，难得！不料你倒先好了。”宝钗虽然有把持，也难掌住。只有袭人也顾不得王夫人在上，便痛哭不止，说：“我也愿意跟了四姑娘去修行。”宝玉笑道：“你也是好心，但是你不能享这个清福的。”袭人哭道：“这么说，我是要死的了？”宝玉听到那里，倒觉伤心，只是说不出来。\n　　因时已五更，宝玉请王夫人安歇。李纨等各自散去。彩屏等暂且伏侍惜春回去，后来指配了人家。紫鹃终身伏侍，毫不改初。此是后话。\n　　且言贾政扶了贾母灵柩，一路南行，因遇着班师的兵将船只过境，河道拥挤，不能速行，在道实在心焦。幸喜遇见了海疆的官员，闻得镇海统制钦召回京，想来探春一定回家，略略解些烦心。只打听不出起程的日期，心里又是烦躁。想到盘费算来不敷。不得已写书一封，差人到赖尚荣任上借银五百，叫人沿途迎来，应付需用。过了数日，贾政的船才行得十数里，那家人回来，迎上船只，将赖尚荣的禀启呈上。书内告了多少苦处，备上白银五十两。贾政看了大怒，即命家人：“立刻送还！将原书发回，叫他不必费心。”那家人无奈，只得回到赖尚荣任所。赖尚荣接到原书银两，心中烦闷，知事办得不周到，又添了一百，央求人带回，帮着说些好话。岂知那人不肯带回，撂下就走。赖尚荣心下不安，立刻修书到家，回明他父亲，叫他设法告假，赎出身来。于是赖家托了贾蔷、贾芸等在王夫人面前乞恩放出。贾蔷明知不能，过了一日，假说王夫人不依的话，回覆了。赖家一面告假，一面差人到赖尚荣任上，叫他告病辞官。王夫人并不知道。\n　　那贾芸听见贾蔷的假话，心里便没想头。连日在外又输了好些银钱，无所抵偿，便和贾环借贷。贾环本是一个钱没有的，虽是赵姨娘有些积蓄，早被他弄光了，那能照应人家？便想起凤姐待他刻薄，趁着贾琏不在家，要摆布巧姐出气，遂把这个当叫贾芸来上，故意的埋怨贾芸道：“你们年纪又大，放着弄银钱的事又不敢办，倒和我没有钱的人商量。”贾芸道：“三叔你这话说的倒好笑。咱们一块儿玩，一块儿闹，那里有有钱的事？”贾环道：“不是前儿有人说是外藩要买个偏房？你们何不和王大舅商量，把巧姐说给他呢？”贾芸道：“叔叔，我说句招你生气的话：外藩花了钱买人，还想能和咱们走动么？”贾环在贾会耳边说了些话。贾芸虽然点头，只道贾环是小孩子的话，也不当事。恰好王仁走来说道：“你们两个人商量些什么？瞒着我吗？”贾芸便将贾环的话附耳低言的说了。王仁拍手道：“这倒是一宗好事，又有银子。只怕你们不能。若是你们敢办，我是亲舅舅，做得主的。只要环老三在大太太跟前那么一说，我找邢大舅再一说，太太们问起来，你们打伙儿说好就是了。”\n　　贾环等商议定了，王仁便去找邢大舅，贾芸便去回邢，王二夫人，说得锦上添花。王夫人听了，虽然入耳，只是不信。那邢夫人听得邢大舅知道，心里愿意，便打发人找了邢大舅来问他。那邢大舅已经听了王仁的话，又可分肥，便在邢夫人跟前说道：“若说这位郡王，是极有体面的。若应了这门亲事，虽说不是正配，管保一过了门，姐夫的官早复了，这里的声势又好了。”邢夫人本是没主意的人，被傻大舅一番假话哄得心动，请了王仁来一问，更说得热闹。于是邢夫人倒叫人出去追着贾芸去说。王仁即刻找了人去到外藩公馆说了。那外藩不知底细，便要打发人来相看。贾芸又钻了相看的人，说明：“原是瞒着合宅的，只说是王府相亲。等到成了，他祖母作主，亲舅舅的保山，是不怕的。”那相看的人应了。贾芸便送信与邢夫人，并回了王夫人。那李纨宝钗等不知原故，只道是件好事，也都欢喜。\n　　那日果然来了几个女人，都是艳妆丽服。邢夫人接了进去，叙了些闲话。那来人本知是个诰命，也不敢怠慢。邢夫人因事未定，也没有和巧姐说明，只说有亲戚来瞧，叫他去见。巧姐到底是个小孩子，那管这些，便跟了奶妈过来。平儿不放心，也跟着来。只见有两个宫人打扮的，见了巧姐，便浑身上下一看，更又起身来拉着巧姐的手又瞧了一遍，略坐了一坐就走了。倒把巧姐看得羞臊。回到房中纳闷，想来没有这门亲戚，便问平儿。平儿先看见来头，却也猜着八九：“必是相亲的。但是二爷不在家，大太太作主，到底不知是那府里的。若说是对头亲，不该这样相看。瞧那几个人的来头，不象是本支王府，好象是外头路数。如今且不必和姑娘说明，且打听明白再说。”\n　　平儿心下留神打听，那些丫头婆子都是平儿使过的，平儿一问，所有听见外头的风声都告诉了。平儿便吓的没了主意，虽不和巧姐说，便赶着去告诉了李纨、宝钗，求他二人告诉王夫人。王夫人知道这事不好，便和邢夫人说知。怎奈邢夫人信了兄弟并王仁的话，反疑心王夫人不是好意，便说：“孙女儿也大了。现在琏儿不在家，这件事我还做得主。况且他亲舅爷爷和亲舅舅打听的，难道倒比别人不真么？我横竖是愿意的。倘有什么不好，我和琏儿也抱怨不着别人。”王夫人听了这些话，心下暗暗生气，勉强说些闲话，便走了出来告诉了宝钗，自己落泪。宝玉劝道：“太太别烦恼，这件事，我看来是不成的。这又是巧姐儿命里所招，只求太太不管就是了。”王夫人道：“你一开口就是疯话！人家说定了就要接过去。若依平儿的话，你琏二哥哥不抱怨我么？别说自己的侄孙女儿，就是亲戚家的，也是要好才好。邢姑娘是我们作媒的，配了你二大舅子，如今和和顺顺的日子，不好么？那琴姑娘，梅家娶了去，听见说是丰衣足食的，很好。就是史姑娘，是他叔叔的主意，头里原好，如今姑爷痨病死了，你史妹妹立志守寡，也就苦了。若是巧姐儿错给了人家儿，可不是我的心坏？”正说着，平儿过来瞧宝钗，并探听邢夫人的口气。王夫人将邢夫人的话说了一遍。平儿呆了半天，跪下求道：“巧姐儿终身，全仗着太太！若信了人家的话，不但姑娘一辈子受了苦，便是琏二爷回来，怎么说呢？”王夫人道：“你是个明白人，起来听我说：巧姐儿到底是大太太孙女儿，他要作主，我能够拦他么？”宝玉劝道：“无妨碍的，只要明白就是了。”平儿生怕宝玉疯癫嚷出来，也并不言语，回了王夫人，竟自去了。\n　　这里王夫人想到烦闷，一阵心痛，叫丫头扶着，勉强回到自己房中躺下，不叫宝玉、宝钗过来，说睡睡就好的。自己却也烦闷。听见说李婶娘来了，也不及接待。只见贾兰进来请了安，回道：“今早爷爷那里打发人带了一封书子来，外头小子们传进来的。我母亲接了，正要过来，因我老娘来了，叫我先呈给太太瞧，回来我母亲就过来来回太太。还说我老娘要过来呢。”说着，一面把书子呈上。王夫人一面接书，一面问道：“你老娘来作什么？”贾兰道：“我也不知道。我听见我老娘说：我三姨儿的婆婆家有什么信儿来了。”王夫人听了，想起来还是前次给甄宝玉说了李绮，后来放定下茶，想来此时甄家要娶过门，所以李婶娘来商量这件事情。便点点头儿，一面拆开来信，见上面写着道：\n　　近因沿途俱系海疆凯旋船只，不能迅速前行。闻探姐随翁婿来都，不知曾有信否？前接到琏侄手禀，知大老爷身体欠安，亦不知已有确信否？宝玉、兰儿场期已近，务须实心用功，不可怠惰。老太太灵柩抵家，尚需日时。我身体平善，不必挂念。此谕宝玉等知道。月日手书。蓉儿另禀。\n　　王夫人看了，仍旧递给贾兰，说：“你拿去给你二叔叔瞧瞧，还交给你母亲罢。”正说着，李纨同李婶娘过来，请安问好毕，王夫人让了坐。李婶娘便将甄家要娶李绮的话说了一遍。大家商议了一会子。李纨因问王夫人道：“老爷的书子，太太看过了么？”王夫人道：“看过了。”贾兰便拿着给他母亲瞧。李纨看了道：“三姑娘出了门好几年，总没有来，如今要回京了，太太也放了好些心。”王夫人道：“我本是心痛，看见探丫头要回来了，心里略好些，只是不知几时才到？”李婶娘便问了贾政在路好。李纨因向贾兰道：“哥儿瞧见了？场期近了，你爷爷惦记的什么似的。你快拿了去给二叔叔瞧去罢。”李婶娘道：“他们爷儿两个又没进过学，怎么能下场呢？”王夫人道：“他爷爷做粮道的起身时，给他们爷儿两个援了例监了。”李婶娘点头。贾兰一面拿着书子出来，来找宝玉。\n　　却说宝玉送了王夫人去后，正拿着《秋水》一篇在那里细玩。宝钗从里间走出，见他看的得意忘言，便走过来一看。见是这个，心里着实烦闷，细想：“他只顾把这些出世离群的话当作一件正经事，终久不妥！”看他这种光景，料劝不过来，便坐在宝玉旁边，怔怔的瞅着。宝玉见他这般，便道：“你这又是为什么？”宝钗道：“我想你我既为夫妇，你便是我终身的倚靠，却不在情欲之私。论起荣华富贵，原不过是过眼烟云，但自古圣贤，以人品根柢为重。”宝玉也没听完，把那本书搁在旁边，微微的笑道：“据你说‘人品根抵’，又是什么‘古圣贤’，你可知古圣贤说过，‘不失其赤子之心’？那赤子有什么好处？不过是无知无识无贪无忌。我们生来已陷溺在贪嗔痴爱中，犹如污泥一般，怎么能跳出这般尘网？如今才晓得‘聚散浮生’四字，古人说了，不曾提醒一个。既要讲到人品根柢，谁是到那太初一步地位的？”宝钗道：“你既说‘赤于之心’，古圣贤原以忠孝为赤子之心，并不是遁世离群、无关无系为赤子之心。尧、舜、禹、汤、周、孔，时刻以救民济世为心，所谓赤子之心，原不过是‘不忍’二字。若你方才所说的忍于抛弃天伦，还成什么道理？”宝玉点头笑道：“尧舜不强巢许，武周不强夷齐。”宝钗不等他说完，便道：“你这个话，益发不是了。古来若都是巢、许、夷、齐，为什么如今人又把尧、舜、周、孔称为圣贤呢？况且你自比夷齐，更不成话。夷齐原是生在殷商末世，有许多难处之事，所以才有托而逃。当此圣世，咱们世受国恩，祖父锦衣玉食；况你自有生以来，自去世的老太太，以及老爷太太，视如珍宝。你方才所说，自己想一想，是与不是？”宝玉听了，也不答言，只有仰头微笑。宝钗因又劝道：“你既理屈词穷，我劝你从此把心收一收，好好的用用功，但能博得一第，便是从此而止，也不枉天恩祖德了。”宝玉点了点头，叹了口气，说道：“一第呢其实也不是什么难事。倒是你这个‘从此而止’，‘不枉天恩祖德’，却还不离其宗。”宝钗未及答言，袭人过来说道：“刚才二奶奶说的古圣先贤，我们也不懂。我只想着我们这些人，从小儿辛辛苦苦跟着二爷，不知陪了多少小心，论起理来原该当的，但只二爷也该体谅体谅。况且二奶奶替二爷在老爷太太跟前行了多少孝道，就是二爷不以夫妻为事，也不可太辜负了人心。至于神仙那一层，更是谎话，谁见过有走到凡间来的神仙呢？那里来的这么个和尚，说了些混话，二爷就信了真！二爷是读书的人，难道他的话比老爷太太还重么？”宝玉听了，低头不语。\n　　袭人还要说时，只听外面脚步走响，隔着窗户问道：“二叔在屋里呢么？”宝玉听了是贾兰的声音，便站起来笑道：“你进来罢。”宝钗也站起来。贾兰进来，笑容可掬的给宝玉、宝钗请了安，问了袭人的好，袭人也问了好，便把书子呈给宝玉瞧。宝玉接在手中看了，便道：“你三姑姑回来了？”贾兰道：“爷爷既如此写，自然是回来的了。”宝玉点头不语，默默如有所思。贾兰便问：“叔叔看见了，爷爷后头写着，叫咱们好生念书呢。叔叔这程子只怕总没作文章罢？”宝玉笑道：“我也要作几篇熟一熟手，好去诓这个功名。”贾兰道：“叔叔既这样，就拟几个题目，我跟着叔叔作作，也好进去混场。别到那时交了白卷子，惹人笑话；不但笑话我，人家连叔叔都要笑话了。”宝玉道：“你也不至如此。”说着，宝钗命贾兰坐下。宝玉仍坐在原处，贾兰侧身坐了。两个谈了一回文，不觉喜动颜色。宝钗见他爷儿两个谈得高兴，便仍进屋里去了，心中细想：“宝玉此时光景，或者醒悟过来了。只是刚才说活，他把那‘从此而止’四字单单的许可，这又不知是什么意思了？”宝钗尚自犹豫。惟有袭人看他爱讲文章，提到下场，更又欣然，心里想道：“阿弥陀佛！好容易讲《四书》似的才讲过来了。”这里宝玉和贾兰讲文，莺儿沏过茶来。贾兰站起来接了，又说了一会子下场的规矩，并请甄宝玉在一处的话，宝玉也甚似愿意。\n　　一时贾兰回去，便将书子留给宝玉了。那宝玉看着书子，笑嘻嘻走进来，递给麝月收了，便出来将那本《庄子》收了。把几部向来最得意的，如《参同契》、《元命苞》、《五灯会元》之类，叫出麝月、秋纹、莺儿等都搬了搁在一边。宝钗见他这番举动，甚为罕异，因欲试探他，便笑问道：“不看他倒是正经，但又何必搬开呢。”宝玉道：“如今才明白过来了。这些书都算不得什么。我还要一火焚之，方为干净。”宝钗听了，更欣喜异常。只听宝玉口中微吟道：“内典语中无佛性，金丹法外有仙舟。”宝钗也没很听真，只听得“无佛性”，“有仙舟”几个字，心中转又狐疑，且看他作何光景。宝玉便命麝月秋纹等收拾一间静室，把那些语录名稿及应制诗之类都找出来，搁在静室中，自己却当真静静的用起功来。宝钗这才放了心。\n　　那袭人此时真是闻所未闻，见所未见，便悄悄的笑着向宝钗道：“到底奶奶说话透彻！只一路讲究，就把二爷劝明白了。就只可惜迟了一点儿，临场太近了。”宝钗点头微笑道：“功名自有定数，中与不中，倒也不在用功的迟早。但愿他从此一心巴结正路，把从前那些邪魔永不沾染，就是好了。”说到这里，见房里无人，便悄说道：“这一番悔悟过来固然很好，但只一件：怕又犯了前头的旧病，和女孩儿们打起交道来，也是不好。”袭人道：“奶奶说的也是。二爷自从信了和尚，才把这些姐妹冷淡了；如今不信和尚，真怕又要犯了前头的旧病呢。我想：奶奶和我，二爷原不大理会。紫鹃去了，如今只他们四个。这里头就是五儿有些个狐媚子，听见说，他妈求了大奶奶和奶奶，说要讨出去给人家儿呢，但是这两天到底在这里呢。麝月秋纹虽没别的，只是二爷那几年也都有些顽顽皮皮的。如今算来，只有莺儿二爷倒不大理会，况且莺儿也稳重。我想倒茶弄水，只叫莺儿带着小丫头们伏侍就够了，不知奶奶心里怎么样？”宝钗道：“我也虑的是这个，你说的倒也罢了。”从此便派莺儿带着小丫头伏侍。那宝玉却也不出房门，天天只差人去给王夫人请安。王夫人听见他这番光景，那一种欣慰之情更不待言了。\n到了八月初三这一日，正是贾母的冥寿。宝玉早晨过来磕了头，便回去，仍到静室中去了。饭后，宝钗袭人等都和姊妹们跟着邢、王二夫人在前面屋里说闲话儿。宝玉自在静室，冥心危坐。忽见莺儿端了一盘瓜果进来，说：“太太叫人送来给二爷吃的，这是老太太的克什。”宝玉站起来答应了，复又坐下，便道：“搁在那里罢。”莺儿一面放下瓜果，一面悄悄向宝玉道：“太太那里夸二爷呢。”宝玉微笑。莺儿又道：“太太说了，二爷这一用功，明儿进场中了出来，明年再中了进士，作了官，老爷太太可就不枉了盼二爷了。”宝玉也只点头微笑。莺儿忽然想起那年终宝玉打络子的时候宝玉说的话来，便道：“真要二爷中了，那可是我们姑奶奶的造化了。二爷还记得那一年在园子里，不是二爷叫我打梅花络子时说的：我们姑奶奶后来带着我不知到那一个有造化的人家儿去呢？如今二爷可是有造化的罢咧！”宝玉听到这里，又觉尘心一动，连忙敛神定息，微微的笑道：“据你说来，我是有造化的，你们姑娘也是有造化的，你呢？”莺儿把脸飞红了，勉强笑道：“我们不过当丫头一辈子罢咧，有什么造化呢。”宝玉笑道：“果然能够一辈子是丫头，你这个造化比我们还大呢。”莺儿听见这话，似乎又是疯话了，恐怕自己招出宝玉的病根来，打算着要走。只见宝玉笑着说道：“傻丫头，我告诉你罢。”\n未知宝玉又说出什么话来，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Lady Xing and Lady Wang knew from Madam You’s report that there was no way to make Xichun change her mind. The latter said, “If you’re bent on doing good, my child, that shows you have the root of goodness in you from a previous existence. Of course we can’t stop you. But it’s hardly fitting for a girl from our house to become a nun. Now that your sister-in-law has given her consent, however, it may be for the best. I’ve just one thing to say: You needn’t shave your head. If your heart is set on this, what does hair matter? Look at Miaoyu — she shaved her head to become a nun, but then something must have upset her equilibrium and she came to a bad end. Since you’re so set on this, we’ll turn your present quarters into a retreat for you. But we must ask your maids if they are willing to join you. If any are, they’ll have to give up all thought of marriage; if not, we’ll have to make other arrangements for them.”\n\nAt that, Xichun stopped weeping and bowed to thank Lady Xing, Lady Wang, Li Wan and Madam You.\n\nLady Wang then asked Caiping and the other maids, “Which of you are willing to attend your young mistress in her religious life?”\n\n“We’ll do whatever you decide, madam,” they answered.\n\nKnowing that none of them were willing, Lady Wang was wondering what to do when Xiren, standing behind Baoyu, feared that this would upset him again and bring on a relapse. To her surprise, however, he simply sighed and said, “What a rare thing to do!”\n\nThis distressed Xiren even more. Baochai said nothing, having sounded him out and found him still so besotted that she could only shed tears in secret.\n\nLady Wang was on the point of questioning the other maids when she saw Zijuan step forward and kneel before her.\n\n“Just now, madam, you were asking which of us would attend the fourth young lady,” she said. “What do you think, madam?”\n\n“How can we force anyone?” replied Lady Wang. “Whoever is willing will say so.”\n\n“If the young lady wants to enter the religious life, that’s her own wish, not something her maids have urged her to do. May I make a suggestion, madam? I’m not trying to break up the rest of the household; but everyone has her own feelings. I served Miss Lin, as you know, and she was so good to me — her kindness was truly as great as a mountain. I’ve no way to repay it. At her death I would gladly have followed her to the grave, but as she wasn’t a member of this house and I’d received favours from my mistresses here too, I couldn’t do that. Now that the fourth young lady means to become a nun, I beg you to allow me to wait on her. I’d serve her all my life. I don’t know if you’ll grant me this or not. If you do, I shall be very lucky.”\n\nBefore Lady Xing and Lady Wang could answer, Baoyu was reminded of Daiyu and felt a stab of grief. Tears ran down his cheeks. The others were about to ask what was the matter when to their amazement he burst out laughing and stepped forward.\n\n“I shouldn’t say this,” he cried. “But as Zijuan was assigned to my place by you, madam, I’ll make bold to beg you to let her have her way and do this good deed.”\n\nLady Wang said, “In the past, when one of your cousins married you cried as if you were dying; yet now that your fourth sister wants to become a nun, instead of trying to dissuade her you approve and call it a good deed. What’s the meaning of this? I simply don’t understand you.”\n\n“Fourth sister has made up her mind, hasn’t she?” he replied. “If she’s really determined, I’ve something to tell you; if not, I’d better not talk nonsense.”\n\nXichun said, “Second brother, you do talk strangely. If I weren’t determined, would I have been able to win the mistresses over? Like Zijuan, I feel that if I’m allowed to do this I shall be lucky; if not, there’s still death — so why should I be afraid? If you have something to say, out with it.”\n\n“Well, this isn’t letting the cat out of the bag, as it’s bound to happen anyway. Let me recite you a poem.”\n\nJust then Baochai said to him, “You’re a fine one, making up poems to upset us when we’re so distressed.”\n\n“I didn’t make it up,” he answered. “I saw it somewhere. If you don’t believe me, listen to this.”\n\n“All right, recite it,” they said. “But no more of your nonsense.”\n\nWithout arguing he recited:\n\nI see the transience of the three months of spring,\n\nAnd the black habit which now replaces gay dresses.\n\nAlas, the daughter of an illustrious house\n\nSleeps alone by the dimly lit old shrine.\n\nLi Wan and Baochai exclaimed in consternation, “This is terrible! He’s bewitched!”\n\nLady Wang, hearing this, nodded and sighed, “Where did you see this, Baoyu?”\n\nNot liking to tell her, he replied, “You have no call to ask, madam. I saw it somewhere, that’s all.”\n\nShe thought this over and it reduced her to tears. “You told me the other day it was only a joke,” she sobbed. “How is it you suddenly came out with this poem? Well, I understand. There’s nothing I can do about it. You must just go your own way. But wait till I’ve closed my eyes, then you can do as you please!”\n\nBaochai tried to comfort her, though her own heart was aching as if cut by a knife; but soon she broke down and wept bitterly. Xiren was crying her heart out too, and Qiuwen had to support her. Baoyu, however, neither wept nor tried to reason with them, simply remaining silent. When Jia Lan and Jia Huan heard this, they quietly slipped away.\n\nLi Wan did her best to explain, “This must be some crazy nonsense Baoyu came out with because he’s so upset by the Fourth Sister’s decision to become a nun. It doesn’t mean anything. The only thing that matters now is whether Zijuan is willing or not. We should let her stand up.”\n\nLady Wang said, “What does it matter whether she’s willing or not? Once a person makes up her mind, nobody can stop her. And from what Baoyu says, it seems predestined.”\n\nThen Zijuan kowtowed. And Xichun thanked Lady Wang. Zijuan also kowtowed to Baoyu and Baochai.\n\nBaoyu exclaimed, “Amida Buddha! This is rare, very rare! So you’ve attained enlightenment before me.”\n\nBaochai for all her self-control could not hold back her tears, while Xiren, ignoring the presence of Lady Wang, wept as if her heart would break.\n\n“I would like to go with the Fourth Mistress to practice religion,” she sobbed.\n\nBaoyu told her with a smile, “You mean well, but you’re not fated to enjoy pure happiness.”\n\n“Does that mean I must die?” she cried.\n\nThis touched Baoyu to the heart, but he could not express what he felt.\n\nAs it was now the fifth watch, he urged Lady Wang to rest. Li Wan and the others dispersed. Caiping and some other maids saw Xichun back to her quarters, and later Caiping was married off. Zijuan served Xichun all her life, never wavering in her devotion. But this is anticipating.\n\nLet us return to Jia Zheng, who was escorting the Lady Dowager’s coffin south. Because of troops and boats passing after a victory, the canal was congested and their progress was slow, which worried him. However, he had the good fortune to meet an official from the coastal regions who told him that the naval commander at Zhenhai had been recalled to the capital. This news cheered him a little, as he assumed that Tanchun would be coming home; but not knowing the date of her departure he fretted again. Then, finding his funds running short, he had to write a letter and send a servant to Lai Shangrong’s post to borrow five hundred taels, instructing the man to bring the money to meet him on the way. A few days later, when his boat had covered only a dozen miles or so, the servant caught up with it and presented Lai Shangrong’s reply. The letter was full of complaints and enclosed only fifty taels of silver.\n\nIn a rage, Jia Zheng ordered the servant, “Take this back at once and return it with the letter! Tell him there’s no need for him to trouble.” The servant had to go back to Lai Shangrong’s yamen. When the latter received the returned letter and silver, he knew that he had handled the matter badly and added another hundred taels.\n\nHe begged the messenger to take it back and put in a good word for him; but the man refused, simply leaving the letter and going away. Deeply disturbed, Lai Shangrong immediately wrote home to his father, asking him to apply for leave and secure his release. So the Lais asked Jia Qiang and Jia Yun to beg Lady Wang on their behalf to free him. Jia Qiang, knowing this was impossible, a day later reported that Her Ladyship had refused.\n\nThe Lais then applied for leave for Lai Da, while sending a man to Lai Shangrong’s post to tell him to resign on the pretext of illness. Lady Wang knew nothing of this.\n\nWhen Jia Yun heard Jia Qiang’s lie he gave up hope. Having lost a good deal of money gambling outside during the last few days and having no means to pay his debts, he asked Jia Huan for a loan. But Jia Huan had no money at all. Although Concubine Zhao had some savings, he had long since squandered them and was in no position to help anyone. This reminded him of Xifeng’s heartlessness to him, and as Jia Lian was away from home he decided to vent his anger by making things hot for Qiaojie. So he egged on Jia Yun, complaining to him, “You’re older than I am, yet you dare not try money-making ventures and come asking help from a pauper like me.”\n\nJia Yun retorted, “Don’t talk nonsense, uncle. We’re in the same boat, having fun together. What money-making ventures are you talking about?”\n\n“Didn’t someone say the other day that a prince wants to buy a concubine? Why don’t you talk to Uncle Wang and arrange to have Qiaojie sold to him?”\n\n“Uncle, you may not like this, but if that prince spends money to buy a girl, will he still have any truck with us?”\n\nJia Huan whispered something in his ear. Jia Yun, though he nodded, thought this childish talk and paid no attention to it. Just then Wang Ren arrived.\n\n“What are you two plotting?” he asked. “Keeping it from me, eh?”\n\nJia Yun whispered Jia Huan’s proposal to him.\n\nWang Ren clapped his hands. “That’s a good idea! It will bring in money too. But I doubt if you can pull it off. If you have the nerve to do it, I’m her uncle on the mother’s side and can decide for her. If Master Huan will propose it to Lady Xing, I’ll back him up by asking my elder brother to put in a word too. Then if the ladies question it, we can all swear that it’s a good match.”\n\nThis settled, Wang Ren went to see Lady Xing’s brother, while Jia Yun went to report to Lady Xing and Lady Wang, making the proposal sound most tempting. Lady Wang, though she listened, did not believe him; but Lady Xing, on hearing that her brother knew of this, was quite willing. She sent to fetch him, and Xing Decheng who had been primed by Wang Ren and hoped for a cut told her, “This prince is a most distinguished man. If this match is arranged, though Qiaojie won’t be his primary wife, once she enters his house her father’s rank is bound to be restored and this household will be powerful again.”\n\nLady Xing, who had no judgment, was taken in by her foolish brother’s glib talk. She sent for Wang Ren, who made it sound even better. So then she actually sent to urge Jia Yun to go ahead with the business. Wang Ren lost no time in sending someone to the prince’s residence to make the proposal.\n\nThe prince, not knowing the facts, dispatched attendants to have a look at the girl. Jia Yun tipped these men to tell them, “This is being done without the knowledge of the whole house. When you come, just say that you’re from the prince’s household to see the girl. Once the thing is settled, her grandmother will be the one to decide, and her own uncle will be the guarantor, so there’s nothing to fear.”\n\nThe men assented. Jia Yun sent word to Lady Xing and also reported to Lady Wang. Li Wan and Baochai, not knowing the truth, supposed this was a good match and were delighted too.\n\nThe prince’s attendants, some women, arrived that day, all gaily dressed. Lady Xing received them and after some small talk, as they knew she was the wife of an official they did not presume to be disrespectful. Because the matter was not yet settled,\n\nWithout explaining the situation to Qiaojie, they simply told her that some relatives had come to see her and she was to go and greet them. Being only a child, she suspected nothing and went over with her nurse, Ping’er following uneasily behind. Two women in palace attire looked Qiaojie up and down, then rose to take her hand and inspect her more closely before sitting down again for a short while and taking their leave. Qiaojie went back to her room feeling quite embarrassed. She could not think who these relatives were and asked Ping’er. The latter had guessed from their manner that they must have come to inspect her as a prospective bride; but as Master Lian was away from home and Lady Xing had arranged this, she could not tell which family they were from. If this was a suitable match, she thought, they should not have made this inspection. And from their manner they did not seem to be from the main branch of the Prince’s household but from some outside princes. However, she did not want to tell Qiaojie this yet, but decided to wait until she had found out more.\n\nPing’er made discreet inquiries. The maids and serving-women, all of whom had worked under her, told her all the rumours they had heard outside. This so alarmed her that she did not know what to do. Though keeping it from Qiaojie, she lost no time in telling Li Wan and Baochai and begging them to inform Lady Wang. The latter, realizing that this was serious, spoke to Lady Xing. But Lady Xing, taken in by her brother and Wang Ren, suspected Lady Wang of ill faith.\n\n“My granddaughter is grown up,” she said. “As Lian’s away, this is for me to decide. Besides, her grand-uncle and uncle have made inquiries — how can they be less reliable than other people? I’m quite willing to agree to this match. If anything goes wrong, Lian and I won’t blame anyone else.”\n\nLady Wang was furious but had to hold her tongue. After some casual remarks she left to tell Baochai what had been said, and could not hold back her tears.\n\nBaoyu consoled her, “Don’t upset yourself, madam. I don’t think this will come off. It’s Qiaojie’s fate. Just don’t interfere, that’s all.”\n\n“You’re talking nonsense again!” she scolded. “They’ve fixed it and mean to fetch her over soon. If I do nothing, as Ping’er suggests, won’t your Cousin Lian complain? Even if she weren’t my own grand-niece but just a relative, I’d want her to make a good match. We found a husband for Miss Xing, your second brother’s wife, and aren’t they living happily together? And we heard that Miss Mei, who married into the Mei family, is very comfortably off too. It was her uncle’s idea to marry Miss Xiangyun to the young Wei; that seemed a good match at first, but now her husband’s died of consumption and she’s determined to remain a widow — how hard on her! If Qiaojie is married into the wrong family, won’t it be my fault?”\n\nAs she was speaking, Ping’er came in to see Baochai and sound out Lady Wang as to Lady Xing’s reaction. When told what she had said, Ping’er was aghast.\n\nAfter some moments she fell on her knees and begged, “Qiaojie’s whole future depends on you, madam! If you believe them, not only will the child suffer all her life, but what are we to say to Master Lian when he comes back?”\n\n“You have good sense. Get up and listen to me,” said Lady Wang. “After all, Qiaojie is her grandmother’s granddaughter. If Lady Xing insists on deciding, how can I prevent her?”\n\nBaoyu chimed in, “It doesn’t matter so long as we understand the situation.”\n\nAfraid that he might make some crazy outburst, Ping’er said nothing but went back to report to Lady Wang.\n\nThis conversation had so upset Lady Wang that her heart started aching. Supported by her maids she went to lie down in her own room, telling Baoyu and Baochai she needed sleep and would be better by and by. But she remained so distressed that when notified of Aunt Li’s arrival she felt unable to receive her. Just then Jia Lan came in to pay his respects.\n\nJust now one of the menservants outside brought in a letter sent by my grandfather. My mother took it and was coming over, but as my grandmother arrived she sent me first to show it to you, madam. She’ll be coming later to report to you, and says my grandmother would like to call on you too.” He handed the letter to Lady Wang.\n\nShe took it and asked, “What has your grandmother come for?”\n\n“I don’t know. I heard her say that my third aunt’s mother-in-law has sent some message.”\n\nThen Lady Wang knew that since Li Wen’s betrothal to Zhen Baoyu had been settled, the Zhens must be asking for her to be sent to them; so Li Wan’s mother had come to discuss this. She nodded and opened the letter, which read as follows:\n\nOwing to the large number of ships of our triumphant navy along the coast, our progress is unavoidably slow. I have heard that Tanchun is coming to the capital with her father-in-law, but have no details. Lian’s letter informed me that my elder brother is unwell, but I have no further news. As Baoyu and Lan will soon be taking the examinations, they must work hard and not relax. It will be some time before the old lady’s coffin can reach our district. I am well, so do not worry. This is for the information of Baoyu and the others.\n\nWritten on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month.\n\nThere was a separate note from Rong.\n\nWhen Lady Wang had read this she passed the letter back to Jialan, saying, “Take it to your second uncle to read, then give it to your mother.”\n\nAs she spoke, Li Wan came in with her mother. Having paid their respects, they were invited to take seats, and Mrs. Li told Lady Wang that the Zhens wanted to send for Li Wen to get married. They discussed this for a while.\n\nThen Li Wan asked Lady Wang, “Have you read my father-in-law’s letter, madam?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nJialan handed it to his mother, who after reading it remarked, “It is several years since Tanchun left home, and she hasn’t been back. Now that she’s returning to the capital, you must feel much easier in your mind, madam.”\n\n“I was very much upset,” replied Lady Wang. “The news that Tanchun is coming back has eased my mind a little; but I don’t know when they’ll arrive.”\n\nMrs. Li asked after Jia Zheng on his journey.\n\nLi Wan told Jialan, “Did you see that, son? As the examination is near, your grandfather is most concerned about you. Take this quickly to your second uncle.”\n\nMrs. Li asked, “But neither of them has taken the district examination, so how can they go in for the higher ones?”\n\nLady Wang explained, “As his grandfather was formerly a Grain Intendant, they are entitled to sit for the examination.”\n\nThe old lady nodded, and Jialan went off with the letter to look for Baoyu.\n\nAfter seeing his mother out, Baoyu had been perusing closely the essay “The Flood in Autumn.” When Baochai came out of the inner room and saw how rapt he was, she went over to look at what he was reading. Finding that it was this essay, she was most put out.\n\n“He takes such other-worldly nonsense seriously!” she thought. “This will never do.”\n\nHowever, seeing how absorbed he was, she knew it would be no use remonstrating; so she sat down beside him and stared at him in consternation.\n\nHe asked, “Why are you looking at me like that?”\n\n“Since we are husband and wife, you should be my lifelong support — I’m not just thinking of selfish passion and pleasure. Wealth and honour are fleeting as smoke clouds; but from ancient times the sages have stressed the importance of moral character and integrity....”\n\nBefore she could finish, Baoyu put down his book and smiled.\n\n“You talk about moral character and integrity, and ancient sages,” he said. “But don’t you know that the ancient sages said we should not lose our ‘child’s heart’? What is so fine about a child? It’s simply that he has no knowledge, no lusts, no greed. When we are born we are\n\nIn this world which is no better than a quagmire, how can you escape from its toils? Now at last I understand the meaning of the four words: ‘Life is a temporary gathering, a floating dream.’ Though the ancients spoke of this, they never really brought it home to us. If we are to speak of man’s original nature, who can claim to have attained the state of the Great Beginning?’\n\n‘If you speak of the “childlike heart”,’ said Bao-chai, ‘the ancient sages always considered loyalty and filial piety to be the essence of the childlike heart, not abandoning the world and severing all human ties. A Yao, a Shun, a Yu, a Tang, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were at all times concerned with the salvation of the world and the succour of mankind. Their childlike heart lay in their “inability to bear the sufferings of others”. If, as you suggest, we can cast aside our natural obligations, what principle would that be upholding?’\n\nBao-yu nodded and smiled:\n\n‘Yao and Shun did not force Chao-fu or Xu You to serve them; King Wu and the Duke of Zhou did not force Bo-yi or Shu-qi to serve them.’\n\nBefore he could finish, Bao-chai cut in:\n\n‘Now you are being more absurd than ever! If everyone had been like Chao-fu, Xu You, Bo-yi or Shu-qi, why have Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou and Confucius always been held up as the great sages? And it is quite preposterous for you to compare yourself with Bo-yi and Shu-qi! They lived at the end of the Shang dynasty, in an age of great hardship, and that is why they behaved as they did. We are living now in an age of perfect sagehood. Our family has for generations enjoyed the bounty of the throne. Your grandfathers and fathers before you have all been fed and clothed by the grace of the Emperor. And since your birth, first Grandmother, and then Father and Mother have all doted on you and treated you as their most precious possession. Just think for a moment: are you right in saying what you said just now?’\n\nBao-yu made no reply, but looked up at the ceiling and smiled. Bao-chai saw that she had the better of the argument and continued her exhortation:\n\n‘Since I have silenced you, I advise you to rid yourself of these foolish notions and concentrate on your studies. If you can win a place in the examinations, that will be achievement enough. Then you will not have lived in vain, and you will have proved yourself worthy of your ancestors and of the Emperor’s grace.’\n\nBao-yu nodded and sighed:\n\n‘A place in the examinations is no great feat. It is your words “achievement enough” and “worthy of your ancestors” that contain a profound truth.’\n\nBefore Bao-chai could reply, Aroma came into the room and said:\n\n‘What Mrs Bao was saying just now about the ancient sages is beyond the likes of us. But I was thinking of the rest of us, how we’ve worked for you all these years, sir, ever since we were young, and put up with I don’t know how much from you. Not that it wasn’t our place to do so. But you might show us a little consideration, sir. And think how Mrs Bao has done her duty by you in front of Their Ladyships. Even if you don’t set much store by being husband and wife, you shouldn’t treat her so heartlessly. And all this talk of becoming an immortal is a lot of nonsense. Whoever heard of an immortal coming down to live among ordinary human beings? Where did this monk spring from, saying all these crazy things, and you believing every word of it, sir! You are an educated man: how can you set what he says above the wishes of your own father and mother?’\n\nBao-yu hung his head and made no reply.\n\nAroma was about to continue when they heard the sound of footsteps outside, and a voice through the window:\n\n‘Are you in, Uncle?’\n\nBao-yu recognized it as Lan’s voice and stood up at once, smiling:\n\n‘Come in!’\n\nBao-chai also stood up. Lan entered, beaming all over his face, and paid his respects to Bao-yu and Bao-chai. He greeted Aroma and asked after her, and she returned his greeting. Then he handed a letter to Bao-yu, who took it and read it.\n\n‘So your third aunt is coming home?’ he asked.\n\n‘That’s what Grandfather says in his letter, so I suppose she must be,’ replied Lan.\n\nBao-yu nodded thoughtfully and said nothing.\n\n‘Did you notice, Uncle,’ continued Lan, ‘that at the end of his letter Grandfather says we are to study hard? I don’t suppose you’ve been writing any compositions recently, have you, Uncle?’\n\n‘I shall have to write a few, to get my hand in again,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I need to fool the examiner and get myself a degree.’\n\n‘In that case, Uncle, why don’t you think of some subjects, and I can write along with you? Then I can go into the examination and bluff my way through too. I don’t want to hand in a blank paper and be laughed at. It wouldn’t only be me they’d laugh at. They’d laugh at you too, Uncle…’\n\n\"You must be joking.\" \"You needn’t worry about that,\" he rejoined.\n\nThen Baochai told Jia Lan to take a seat. Baoyu remained in his place while Jia Lan sat down beside him. They began to discuss the examination essays, and soon both were looking jubilant. Baochai, seeing how cheerfully father and son were talking, went back to her room.\n\n\"Baoyu seems to have come to his senses at last,\" she reflected. \"But why was it that he agreed so emphatically to my suggestion that this should be the end of it? I can’t make that out.\"\n\nShe was still undecided what to think. Xiren alone was overjoyed to see his interest in essays and the examination. \"Gracious Buddha!\" she thought. \"At long last he’s started discussing the Four Books, just as if they’d got through to him.\"\n\nWhile Baoyu and Jia Lan were talking, Yinger brought in tea. Jia Lan stood up to take it, and they went on to speak of the rules observed at the examination and the proposal to invite Zhen Baoyu to sit with them. Baoyu seemed quite taken with this idea.\n\nPresently Jia Lan went home, leaving the essay with Baoyu, who read it with a smile before giving it to Sheyue to put away. Then, going out, he put away his copy of Zhuangzi and told Sheyue, Qiuwen and Yinger to move to one side certain books of which he had been very fond, such as Can Tong Qi, Yuan Ming Bao and Wu Deng Hui Yuan. Baochai, surprised by this behaviour, asked试探ally, smiling:\n\n\"It’s right not to read those books, but why move them away?\"\n\n\"I see it all clearly now,\" he answered. \"Those books are worthless. I mean to burn them to have done with them once and for all.\"\n\nThis delighted her, though she did not quite believe him. Then he was heard to recite softly:\n\n\"In Buddhist sutras no Buddha is found; Beyond the elixir there is an immortal’s vessel.\"\n\nShe did not catch this clearly, only the words \"no Buddha\" and \"immortal’s vessel,\" which rather puzzled her. She waited to see what he would do next.\n\nBaoyu ordered Sheyue and Qiuwen to clear out a quiet room for him and place in it all the recorded sayings of the sages, famous writings and poems written at the Emperor’s command. Then he settled down quietly to study in earnest, to Baochai’s great relief.\n\nXiren exclaimed, \"This is something never seen or heard of before! You certainly know how to talk, madam! Your discussion of essays has brought him to his senses. The only pity is that it’s rather late, so close to the examination.\"\n\nWith a smile Baochai answered, \"Success in the examinations is predestined, and has nothing to do with how early or late one starts studying. I only hope that from now on he will keep to the straight path and never again get involved with those heretical mystics.\"\n\nThen, noticing that there was no one else in the room, she whispered, \"I’m truly glad that he’s repented, but there’s one thing I’m afraid of: I’m afraid he may relapse and start fooling around with the girls again.\"\n\n\"You’re quite right, madam. It was only after listening to that monk that he cooled off towards us. Now that he’s given up the monk, I’m really afraid he may slip back into his old ways. As I see it, you and I are not much in his good books. Since Zijuan’s left he only cares for those four. And one of them, Wuer, is a vamp. I hear her mother asked Madam Zhu and you, madam, if she could find a husband outside for her; but these last few days she’s still been here. Sheyue and Qiuwen are all right in themselves, but in the old days he used to fool around with them too. That leaves Yinger, whom he’s never paid much attention to; besides, she’s a well-behaved girl. So I thought we could just tell Yinger to bring the younger maids to serve him tea and water. I wonder what you think, madam?\"\n\n\"I’ve been thinking the same.\n\n\"Well, what you say makes sense.\" She thereupon instructed Yinger to wait on him with some young maids. Baoyu did not leave his room either, simply sending servants every day to pay his respects to Lady Wang. His mother was of course overjoyed by this change in him.\n\nOn the third of the eighth month, the anniversary of the Lady Dowager’s death, Baoyu went early to pay his respects by kowtowing, then returned to his quiet room. After the meal, Baochai, Xiren and the other girls sat chatting with Lady Xing and Lady Wang in the front room, while Baoyu meditated alone. Suddenly Yinger came in with a plate of fruit.\n\n\"Her Ladyship sent this for you, sir,\" she said. \"It’s from the offerings to the old lady.\"\n\nBaoyu stood up to acknowledge this, then sat down again.\n\n\"Just put it there,\" he requested.\n\nAs Yinger put down the fruit she whispered, \"Her Ladyship is very pleased with you, sir.\"\n\nBaoyu smiled.\n\nShe continued, \"Her Ladyship says if you study hard now, sir, after the examination and then after passing the palace examination next year and becoming an official, your parents won’t have pinched their hopes of you in vain.\"\n\nBaoyu simply nodded with a smile.\n\nYinger, reminded by this of what he had said that year when he asked her to weave a plum-blossom net, told him, \"If you really become an official, sir, that will be our young mistress’ good fortune. Do you remember that year in the Garden, sir, when you told me to weave that net? You said then that our young mistress and I would go to some fortunate man. Now you’re the fortunate one, sir!\"\n\nAt this Baoyu felt a sudden yearning for the world, but curbing it he answered with a faint smile, \"So according to you I’m fortunate, and your young mistress is fortunate too. What about you?\"\n\nYinger flushed and forced a smile. \"We’re just slaves all our lives. What fortune do we have?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"If you can really be a slave all your life, that’ll be better fortune than ours.\"\n\nThis struck Yinger as more of his crazy talk. Afraid that she had started him off again, she thought of leaving. But then Baoyu said with a smile, \"Silly child, let me tell you....\"\n\nBut nobody knows what else he said."
