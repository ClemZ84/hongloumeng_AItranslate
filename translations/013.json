  "original": "话说凤姐儿，自贾琏送黛玉往扬州去后，心中实在无趣，每到晚间不过同平儿说笑一回，就胡乱睡了。这日夜间和平儿灯下拥炉，早命浓熏绣被，二人睡下，屈指计算行程该到何处。不知不觉已交三鼓，平儿已睡熟了。凤姐方觉睡眼微蒙，恍惚只见秦氏从外走进来，含笑说道：“婶娘好睡！我今日回去，你也不送我一程。因娘儿们素日相好，我舍不得婶娘，故来别你一别。还有一件心愿未了，非告诉婶娘，别人未必中用。”凤姐听了，恍惚问道：“有何心愿？只管托我就是了。”秦氏道：“婶娘，你是个脂粉队里的英雄，连那些束带顶冠的男子也不能过你。你如何连两句俗语也不晓得？常言‘月满则亏，水满则溢。’又道是，‘登高必跌重。’如今我们家赫赫扬扬，已将百载，一日倘或乐极生悲，若应了那句‘树倒猢狲散’的俗语，岂不虚称了一世诗书旧族了？”凤姐听了此话，心胸不快，十分敬畏，忙问道：“这话虑的极是，但有何法可以永保无虞？”秦氏冷笑道：“婶娘好痴也！‘否极泰来’，荣辱自古周而复，岂人力所能常保的？但如今能于荣时筹画下将来衰时的世业，亦可以常远保全了。即如今日，诸事俱妥，只有两件未妥，若把此事如此一行，则后日可保无患了。”凤姐便问道：“什么事？”秦氏道：“目今祖茔虽四时祭祀，只是无一定的钱粮；第二，家塾虽立，无一定的供给。依我想来，如今盛时固不缺祭祀供给，但将来败落之时，此二项有何出处？莫若依我定见，趁今日富贵，将祖茔附近多置田庄、房舍、地亩，以备祭祖、供给之费皆出自此处。将家塾亦设于此。合同族中长幼，大家定了则例，日后按房掌管这一年的地亩钱粮、祭祀供给之事。如此周流，又无争竞，也没有典卖诸弊。便是有罪，己物可以人官，这祭祀产业连官也不入的。便败落下来，子孙回家读书务农也有个退步，祭祀又可永继。若目今以为荣华不绝，不思后日，终非长策。眼见不日又有一件非常的喜事，真是烈火烹油、鲜花着锦之盛。要知道也不过是瞬息的繁华，一时的欢乐，万不可忘了那‘盛筵必散’的俗语。若不早为后虑，只恐后悔无益了！”凤姐忙问：“有何喜事？”秦氏道：“天机不可泄漏。只是我与婶娘好了一场，临别赠你两句话，须要记着！”因念道：\n　　　　三春去后诸芳尽，各自须寻各自门。\n　　凤姐还欲问时，只听二门上传出云板，连叩四下，正是丧音，将凤姐惊醒。人回：“东府蓉大奶奶没了。”凤姐吓了一身冷汗，出了一回神，只得忙穿衣服往王夫人处来。彼时合家皆知，无不纳闷，都有些伤心。那长一辈的想他素日孝顺，平辈的想他素日和睦亲密，下一辈的想他素日慈爱，以及家中仆从老小想他素日怜贫惜贱、爱老慈幼之恩，莫不悲号痛哭。闲言少叙，却说宝玉因近日林黛玉回去，剩得自己落单，也不和人玩耍，每到晚间，便索然睡了。如今从梦中听见说秦氏死了，连忙翻身爬起来，只觉心中似戳了一刀的，不觉的“哇”的一声，直喷出一口血来。袭人等慌慌忙忙上来，扶着问：“是怎么样的？”又要回贾母去请大夫。宝玉道：“不用忙，不相干。这是急火攻心，血不归经。”说着便爬起来，要衣服换了，来见贾母，即时要过去。袭人见他如此，心中虽放不下，又不敢拦阻，只得由他罢了。贾母见他要去，因说：“才咽气的人，那里不干净。二则夜里风大，等明早再去不迟。”宝玉那里肯依。贾母命人备车，多派跟从人役，拥护前来。\n    一直到了宁国府前，只见府门大开，两边灯火，照如白昼。乱烘烘人来人往，里面哭声摇山振岳。宝玉下了车，忙忙奔至停灵之室，痛哭一番，然后见过尤氏。谁知尤氏正犯了胃气疼的旧症，睡在床上。然后又出来见贾珍。彼时贾代儒、代修、贾敕、贾效、贾敦、贾赦、贾政、贾琮、贾、贾珩、贾、贾琛、贾琼、贾、贾蔷、贾菖、贾菱、贾芸、贾芹、贾蓁、贾萍、贾藻、贾菌、贾芬、贾芳、贾蓝、贾菌、贾芝等都来了。贾珍哭的泪人一般，正和贾代儒等说道：“合家大小，远近亲友，谁不知我这媳妇比儿子还强十倍。如今伸腿去了，可见这长房内绝灭无人了！”说着又哭起来。众人劝道：“人已辞世，哭也无益，且商议如何料理要紧。”贾珍拍手道：“如何料理，不过尽我所有罢了！”正说着，只见秦邦业、秦钟、尤氏几个眷属、尤氏妹妹也都来了，贾珍便命贾琼、贾琛、贾、贾蔷四个人去陪客，一面吩咐去请钦天监阴阳司来择日。择准停灵七七四十九日，三日后开丧送讣闻。这四十九日，单请一百零八众僧人在大厅上拜“大悲忏”，超度前亡后死鬼魂，另设一坛于天香楼，是九十九位全真道土，打十九日解冤洗业醮。然后停灵于会芳园中，灵前另外五十众高僧、五十位高道对坛，按七作好事。那贾敬闻得长孙媳妇死了，因自为早晚就要飞升，如何肯又回家染了红尘将前功尽弃呢。故此并不在意，只凭贾珍料理。\n　　且说贾珍恣意奢华，看板时，几副杉木板皆不中意。可巧薛蟠来吊，因见贾珍寻好板，便说：“我们木店里有一副板，说是铁网山上出的，作了棺材，万年不坏的。这还是当年先父带来的，原系忠义亲王老千岁要的，因他坏了事，就不曾用。现在还封在店里，也没有人买得起。你若要，就抬来看看。”贾珍听说甚喜，即命抬来。大家看时，只见帮底皆厚八寸，纹若摈榔，味若擅麝，以手扣之，声如玉石。大家称奇。贾珍笑问道：“价值几何？”薛蟠笑道：“拿着一千两银子只怕没处买，什么价不价，赏他们几两银子作工钱就是了。”贾珍听说，连忙道谢不尽，即命解锯造成。贾政因劝道：“此物恐非常人可享。殓以上等杉木也罢了。”贾珍如何肯听。\n　　忽又听见秦氏之丫环，名唤瑞珠，见秦氏死了，也触柱而亡。此事更为可罕，合族都称叹。贾珍遂以孙女之礼殡殓之，一并停灵于会芳园之登仙阁。又有小丫环名宝珠的，因秦氏无出，乃愿为义女，请任摔丧驾灵之任。贾珍甚喜，即时传命，从此皆呼宝珠为“小姑娘”。那宝珠按未嫁女之礼在灵前哀哀欲绝。于是合族人并家下诸人都各遵旧制行事，自不得错乱。\n　　贾珍因想道：“贾蓉不过是黉门监生，灵幡上写时不好看，便是执事也不多。”因此心下甚不自在。可巧这日正是首七第四日，早有大明宫掌宫内监戴权，先备了祭礼遣人来，次后坐了大轿，打道鸣锣，亲来上祭。贾珍忙接待，让坐至逗蜂轩献茶。贾珍心中早打定主意，因而趁便就说要与贾蓉捐个前程的话。戴权会意，因笑道：“想是为丧礼上风光些？”贾珍忙道：“老内相所见不差。”戴权道：“事倒凑巧，正有个美缺：如今三百员龙禁尉缺了两员，昨儿襄阳侯的兄弟老三来求我，现拿了一千五百两银子送到我家里。你知道，咱们都是老相好，不拘怎么样，看着他爷爷的分上，胡乱应了。还剩了一个缺。谁知永兴节度使冯胖子要求与他孩子捐，我就没工夫应他。既是咱们的孩子要捐，快写个履历来。”贾珍忙命人写了一张红纸履历来。戴权看了，上写着：\n　　江南应天府江宁县监生贾蓉，年二十岁。曾祖，原任京营节度使世袭一等神威将军贾代化。祖，丙辰科进士贾敬。父，世袭三品爵威烈将军贾珍。\n　　戴权看了，回手递与一个贴身的小厮收了，道：“回去送与户部堂官老赵，说我拜上他起一张五品龙禁尉的票，现给个执照，就把这履历填上。明日我来兑银子送过去。”小厮答应了。戴权告辞，贾珍款留不住，只得送出府门。临上轿，贾珍问：“银子还是我到部去兑，还是送入内相府中？”戴权道：“若到部里兑，你又吃亏了。不如平准一千两银子送到我家就完了。”贾珍感谢不尽，说：“待服满，亲带小犬到府叩谢。”于是作别。\n　　接着又吆喝道之声，原来是忠靖侯史鼎的夫人，带着侄女史湘云来了。王夫人、邢夫人、凤姐等刚迎入正房，又见锦乡侯、川宁侯、寿山伯三家祭礼也摆在灵前。少时，三人下轿，贾珍接上大厅。如此亲朋你来我去，也不能计数。只这四十九日，宁国府街上一条白漫漫人来人往，花簇簇官去官来。\n　　贾珍令贾蓉次日换了吉服，领凭回来。灵前供用执事等物俱按五品职例，灵碑疏上皆写“诰授贾门秦氏宜人之灵位”。会芳园临街大门洞开，两边起了鼓乐厅，两班青衣按时奏乐，一对对执事摆的刀斩斧截。更有两面朱红销金大牌竖在门外，上面大书道：“防护内廷紫禁道御前侍卫龙禁尉。”对面高起着宣坛，僧道对坛；榜上大书“世袭宁国公冢孙妇防护内廷御前侍卫龙禁尉贾门秦氏宜人之丧。四大部洲至中之地，奉天永建太平之国，总理虚无寂静沙门僧录司正堂万、总理元始正一教门道纪司正堂叶等，敬谨修斋，朝天叩佛”以及“恭请诸伽蓝、揭谛、功曹等神，圣恩普锡，神威远振，四十九日销灾洗业平安水陆道场”等语，亦不及繁记。\n　　只是贾珍虽然心意满足，但里面尤氏又犯了旧疾，不能料理事务，惟恐各诰命来往，亏了礼数，怕人笑话，因此心中不自在。当下正忧虑时，因宝玉在侧，便问道：“事事都算安贴了，大哥哥还愁什么？”贾珍便将里面无人的话告诉了他。宝玉听说：笑道：“这有何难，我荐一个人与你，权理这一个月的事，管保妥当。”贾珍忙问：“是谁？”宝玉见坐间还有许多亲友，不便明言，走向贾珍耳边说了两句。贾珍听了，喜不自胜，笑道：“这果然妥贴。如今就去。”说着拉了宝玉，辞了众人，便往上房里来。\n可巧这日非正经日期，亲友来的少，里面不过几位近亲堂客，邢夫人、王夫人、凤姐并合族中的内眷陪坐。闻人报：“大爷进来了。”唬的众婆娘“唿”的一声，往后藏之不迭。独凤姐款款站了起来。贾珍此时也有些病症在身，二则过于悲痛，因拄个拐踱了进来。邢夫人等因说道：“你身上不好，又连日多事，该歇歇才是，又进来做什么？”贾珍一面拄拐，扎挣着要蹲身跪下请安道乏，邢夫人等忙叫宝玉搀住，命人拿椅子与他坐。贾珍不肯坐，因勉强陪笑道：“侄儿进来有一件事要求二位婶娘、大妹妹。”邢夫人等忙问：“什么事？”贾珍忙说道：“婶娘自然知道，如今孙子媳妇没了，侄儿媳妇又病倒。我看里头着实不成体统，要屈尊大妹妹一个月，在这里料理料理，我就放心了。”邢夫人笑道：“原来为这个。你大妹妹现在你二婶娘家，只和你二婶娘说就是了。”王夫人忙道：“他一个小孩子，何曾经过这些事，倘或料理不清，反叫人笑话，倒是再烦别人好。”贾珍笑道：“婶娘的意思侄儿猜着了，是怕大妹妹劳苦了。若说料理不开，从小儿大妹妹玩笑时就有杀伐决断，如今出了阁，在那府里办事，越发历练老成了。我想了这几日，除了大妹妹再无人可求了。婶娘不看侄儿和侄儿媳妇面上，只看死的分上罢！”说着流下泪来。”\n王夫人心中为的是凤姐未经过丧事，怕他料理不起，被人见笑。今见贾珍苦苦的说，心中已活了几分，却又眼看着凤姐出神。那凤姐素日最喜揽事，好卖弄能干，今见贾珍如此央他，心中早已允了。又见王夫人有活动之意，便向王夫人道：“大哥说得如此恳切，太太就依了罢。”王夫人悄悄的问道：“你可能么？”凤姐道：“有什么不能的。外面的大事已经大哥哥料理清了，不过是里面照管照管。便是我有不知的，问太太就是了。”王夫人见说得有理，便不出声。贾珍见凤姐允了，又陪笑道：“也管不得许多了，横竖要求大妹妹辛苦辛苦。我这里先与大妹妹行礼，等完了事，我再到那府里去谢。”说着就作揖，凤姐连忙还礼不迭。\n　　贾珍便命人取了宁国府的对牌来，命宝玉送与凤姐，说道：“妹妹爱怎么就怎么样办，要什么，只管拿这个取去，也不必问我。只求别存心替我省钱，要好看为上；二则也同那府里一样待人才好，不要存心怕人抱怨。只这两件外，我再没不放心的了。”凤姐不敢就接牌，只看着王夫人，王夫人道：“你大哥既这么说，你就照看照看罢了。只是别自作主意，有了事打发人问你哥哥嫂子一声儿要紧。”宝玉早向贾珍手里接过对牌来，强递与凤姐了。贾珍又问：“妹妹还是住在这里，还是天天来呢？若是天天来，越发辛苦了。我这里赶着收拾出一个院落来，妹妹住过这几日，倒安稳。”凤姐笑说：“不用，那边也离不得我，倒是天天来的好。”贾珍说：“也罢了。”然后又说了一回闲话，方才出去。\n一时女眷散后，王夫人因问凤姐：“你今儿怎么样？”凤姐道：“太太只管请回去；我须得先理出一个头绪来才回得去呢。”王夫人听说，便先同邢夫人回去，不在话下。这里凤姐来至三间一所抱厦中坐了。因想，头一件是人口混杂，遗失东西；二件，事无专管，临期推委；三件，需用过费，滥支冒领；四件，任无大小，苦乐不均；五件，家人豪纵，有脸者不能服钤束，无脸者不能上进。此五件实是宁府中风俗。\n不知凤姐如何处治，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Jia Lian had seen Daiyu off to Yangzhou, Xifeng found life rather dull. Every evening she would chat or laugh for a time with Pinger before going to bed at random. One evening, the two of them having gone to bed early after warming themselves by the brazier in the lamplight and fumigating the quilts with incense, they were reckoning on their fingers how far her husband must have travelled when Pinger fell asleep. Xifeng herself was growing drowsy when she seemed to see Qinshi come in.\n\n“How sound you’re sleeping, aunt!” said Qinshi with a smile. “I’m going away today, yet you couldn’t even see me off. But because we’ve always been so close, I’ve come to say goodbye. There’s one thing besides that I’d like to entrust to you, aunt, as no one else is fit to undertake it.”\n\n“What is it?” Xifeng asked mechanically.\n\n“You’re such an exceptional woman, aunt, a heroine among women, that even men in official belts and caps are no match for you. Is it possible you don’t know the sayings that ‘the moon waxes only to wane, water brims only to overflow,’ and ‘the higher the climb the harder the fall’? Our house has prospered for nearly a hundred years. If one day it happens that at the height of good fortune the ‘tree falls and the monkeys scatter’ as the old saying has it, then what will become of our cultured old family?”\n\nXifeng was impressed and awed by this.\n\n“Your fear is well founded,” she replied. “But what can be done to prevent it?”\n\n“How stupid you are, aunt!” Qinshi gave a mocking laugh. “Bad luck follows good as surely as disgrace follows honour. This has been so from time immemorial. How can men prevent it? The only thing to do is to make some provision for lean years in times of plenty. Take today. Everything is fine, but there are two things that aren’t being done which would ensure future security if they were attended to now.”\n\n“What things?”\n\n“Although at the ancestral graves sacrifices are offered at the four seasons, there’s no fixed source of income for this; and although there’s a family school, it has no fixed endowment. In my opinion, even if we have all we need now for the sacrifices and school, in future when the family falls on hard times what source will there be for these expenses? I think we should invest our present wealth in some farms and land near the ancestral graves to provide for the sacrifices; and the school should be moved to the same place. Then, with the proper rules drawn up, the whole clan can take turns to manage the income from the land — the sacrifices, provisions for the school and so on — for a year at a time. Then, as the outgoings and income would be in circulation, there would be no disputes or abuses. And even if someone were to be punished for a crime by the confiscation of his property, the ancestral estate would be exempt. Even if the family declines in future, the children will have somewhere to go back to to continue their studies and farm the land; and the sacrifices can be continued without interruption. If we just go on in our present extravagant way thinking that good times will last for ever, sooner or later we’re bound to come to grief. Very soon now we’re going to have some splendid celebrations, like adding fuel to the flames or embroidering flowers on brocade. But they’ll be no more than a flash in the pan, a brief moment of bliss. Whatever happens, don’t forget the proverb: ‘Even the grandest feast must have an end.’ You must make some provision betimes for lean years ahead. If you don’t, you’ll regret it too late.”\n\n“What celebrations are coming?” asked Xifeng.\n\n“That is hidden by the ways of Heaven and must not be revealed. But because you’ve been so good to me, aunt, I’d like to give you a word of warning before I go. Remember this couplet:\n\nWhen the three months of spring have sped, each flower’s charm must fade. Let each one heaven’s will obey, for none a season can delay.”\n\nXifeng was about to ask what this meant when she was awakened by four blows on the cloud-board at the second gate — the announcement of a death. A servant came in to announce:\n\n“Madam Rong of the East Mansion has passed away.”\n\nXifeng broke into a cold sweat and gave a start. Then, recovering herself, she dressed and hurried over to Lady Wang’s apartments. The whole household already knew the news and all were filled with foreboding and grief, none more so than those elders who knew how virtuous she had been and the younger\n\nHis juniors remembered how kind and affectionate she had always been, and the servants young and old recalled her past kindness to them, her compassion for the poor and humble, her affection for the old and young. All mourned and lamented her.\n\nBut enough of this.\n\nBaoyu had been very lonely and lost since Daiyu’s return south. He had no heart to play with the other girls but went to bed every night in low spirits. The news of Qin Keqing’s death, coming to him in a dream, made him start up from his pillow with a stab of pain in his heart; and with a cry he spat out a mouthful of blood.\n\nXiren and the other maids hurried over to help him and ask what was wrong. They wanted to fetch the Lady Dowager, but he stopped them.\n\n“Don’t worry,” he said. “It’s nothing. It’s just that the heat of anger has upset my circulation and made me bring up this blood.”\n\nHe got up at once and demanded to be dressed so that he could go to his grandmother and then call on the Jias. Although Xiren was uneasy, not venturing to cross him she helped him to dress and he went in to see the Lady Dowager. He was most eager to be off.\n\nAs he insisted on going, his grandmother ordered a carriage for him and told many servants to accompany him.\n\nThey found the gates of the Ning Mansion wide open and lanterns on both sides making the place as bright as day. There was a confused hubbub of voices and the sound of earth-shaking lamentations. Alighting from his carriage, Baoyu hurried to the room where the corpse was lying and wept there bitterly. Then he went in to see Madam You, who happened to be laid up with a stomachache and was resting in bed. After that he went to find Jia Zhen.\n\nBy this time Jia Dairu, Jia Daixiu, Jia Chi, Jiao Xiao, Jia Dun, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Cong, Jia Bin, Jia Heng, Jia Guang, Jia Chen, Jia Qiong, Jia Lin, Jia Qiang, Jia Chang, Jia Ling, Jia Yun, Jia Qin, Jia Zhen, Jia Ping, Jia Zao, Jia Jun, Jia Fen, Jia Fang, Jia Lan, Jia Jun and Jia Zhi had all arrived. Jia Zhen, dissolved in tears, was telling Jia Dairu and the others:\n\n“Everyone in the family, high and low, and all our friends and relatives know that my daughter-in-law was ten times better than my son. Now she has gone, my branch of the family is finished. There’s not a soul left to carry on.”\n\nAs he broke down again they tried to comfort him.\n\n“She has already breathed her last,” they said. “Crying is no use. We must decide what must be done.”\n\n“What is there to decide?” Jia Zhen clapped his hands. “I shall spend all I have on the funeral.”\n\nJust then Qin Ye and Qin Zhong as well as some relatives of Madam You and her sisters arrived. Jia Zhen ordered Jia Qiong, Jia Chen, Jia Lin and Jia Qiang to entertain the guests, and sent to invite officers from the Board of Astronomy to choose auspicious days for the funeral ceremonies. It was decided that the body should be placed in the coffin after seven times seven or forty-nine days, and mourning should start three days after the death with the issue of obituary notices. During these forty-nine days, a hundred and eight Buddhist monks were to perform mass in the main hall to release the souls of those passed away before and after; another altar was to be erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance where ninety-nine Taoists of the Perfect Truth Sect were to offer sacrifices for nineteen days to redeem the sins of the dead; and the coffin was to be taken to the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, where another fifty high bonzes and fifty high Taoists were to sacrifice before it every seventh day.\n\nJia Jing, on hearing of the death of his eldest grandson’s wife, was too intent on achieving immortality to return home and risk contamination by worldly dust which might spoil all his past efforts. So he left everything to the discretion of Jia Zhen.\n\nJia Zhen, bent on making a lavish display, found several boards of cedarwood unsatisfactory for the coffin. It happened just then that Xue Pan called to offer his condolences, and seeing Jia Zhen’s need of a good coffin he said:\n\n“We have a board in our timber-yard which was cut from iron-wood on the Tie-Net Mountain. It makes a coffin which will last for ten thousand years. My father brought it back, and the Prince of Zhongyi at that time wanted to buy it, but for one reason or another he didn’t take it. It’s still stored with us, and no one has ever been rich enough to buy it. But if you want it, sir, you’re welcome to have it.”\n\n\"If you want it, have it brought for us to see.\" Delighted, Jia Zhen ordered it to be fetched. When it was carried in they saw that it was eight inches thick at both ends, grained like the betel palm and scented like sandalwood or musk. Tapped with the knuckles, it gave out a ring like jade or stone. Everyone exclaimed in admiration.\n\n\"What will it cost?\" asked Jia Zhen with a smile.\n\nXue Pan smiled too. \"You couldn't buy it anywhere for a thousand taels. Never mind the price. Just give the men a few taels for their labour.\"\n\nJia Zhen expressed profuse thanks and ordered workmen to saw the wood to make the coffin.\n\nJia Zheng demurred, \"This is not for ordinary people to use. Better have one made of the best fir.\"\n\nBut Jia Zhen would not listen to him.\n\nNow news came that Qin Keqing's maid Ruizhu had dashed out her brains against a pillar. This struck everyone as even more extraordinary and the whole clan praised the girl. Jia Zhen had her encoffined with the ceremony due to a grandchild and her coffin was placed in the Pavilion of Attained Immortality in Celestial Fragrance Park. Another young maid, Baozhu, offered to act as Keqing's dutiful daughter and take the chief mourner's part. This pleased Jia Zhen so much that he at once gave orders that from then on Baozhu was to be called \"Little Sister.\" She mourned before the coffin most pathetically as was fitting for an unmarried daughter. The whole clan as well as the domestics observed the old conventions, so that everything was done in strict accordance with the rules.\n\nJia Zhen reflected, \"Jia Rong is no more than a state scholar, which doesn't look well in the funeral inscription and doesn't entitle him to many bearers and insignia.\" This worried him.\n\nThe fourth day of the first week of mourning happened to be the day on which Dai Quan, Chief Eunuch of the Palace of Great Splendour, came in a great sedan-chair with sounding gongs to offer sacrifice. After first sending a subordinate with offerings, he had now come in person. Jia Zhen ushered him into the Bee-Teasing Pavilion and served him tea there. Having already made up his mind what to do, he seized this chance to ask the eunuch's help in purchasing an honorary rank for his son.\n\nDai Quan took the hint. \"I suppose you want to make the funeral more impressive?\" he asked.\n\n\"Your assumption is correct, sir,\" replied Jia Zhen.\n\n\"As luck would have it, there's a fine vacancy,\" said Dai Quan. \"Of the three hundred officers assigned to the Imperial Guard, two posts have fallen vacant. Yesterday the third brother of the Marquis of Xiangyang came to ask me for one, bringing fifteen hundred taels of silver to my house. You know how close we old friends are, so for his grandfather's sake I had to agree. There's still one post left. Who would have thought that Fatty Feng, the Military Governor of Yongxing, would ask me to buy it for his son? I didn't have time to promise it to him. If your boy wants it, have a resume of his career written out at once.\"\n\nJia Zhen lost no time in having this written on red paper. Dai Quan read it.\n\nJia Rong, twenty, a state scholar of Jiangning in Yingtian Prefecture. Great-grandfather: Jia Da-hua, hereditary general of the first rank with the appellation Divine Might, formerly commander of the Metropolitan Barracks. Grandfather: Jia Jing, a Palace Graduate in the year bingchen. Father: Jia Zhen, hereditary general of the third rank with the appellation Valiant.\n\nDai Quan handed this to an attendant to keep.\n\n\"Take this to the Board of Revenue,\" he told him, \"and give it to old Zhao the secretary with my compliments. Ask him to issue a patent for a captain in the Imperial Guard of the fifth rank, and fill in this resume. I'll bring the silver tomorrow to be delivered to the Board.\" The attendant assented.\n\nWhen Dai Quan took his leave, Jia Zhen could not detain him but saw him out. At the gate, as the eunuch was about to mount his sedan-chair, Jia Zhen asked, \"Shall I send the silver to the Board or to your residence, sir?\"\n\n\"If you take it to the Board, you'll be cheated. Better give me a thousand taels. That will save trouble.\"\n\nJia Zhen was profuse in his thanks. \"After the mourning is over,\" he promised, \"I shall bring my worthless son to kowtow his gratitude.\"\n\nThey then parted.\n\nNow more shouting was heard at the gate. The wife of the Marquis of Zhongjing had arrived with her niece Shi Xiangyun. Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Xifeng had just welcomed them into the hall when the marquises of Jinxiang and Chuaming and the earl of Shoushan were announced.\n\nOfferings had been placed before the coffin. The three alighted from their chairs and Jia Zhen welcomed them into the main hall. So many friends and relatives came and went that it was impossible to keep count of them all. For forty-nine days the street outside the Ning Mansion was a sea of white mourners as officials in their brilliant robes came and went in an endless stream.\n\nJia Zhen had Jia Rong change the next day into his best clothes to go and collect the official notification of his appointment. All the funeral paraphernalia and sacrifices were those prescribed for an officer of the fifth rank. The inscription on the spirit tablet was: “Spirit Tablet of the Lady Qin, Consort of the Heir Apparent of the Ning Guo Duke, Invested with the Rank of Worthy and Virtuous Lady by Imperial Patent.”\n\nThe main gate of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance opening on to the street was thrown wide. On either side stood drum towers and two bands of musicians in blue played at the proper times. The bearers of insignia, arranged in pairs, stood stiffly to attention. Two big vermilion boards inscribed in gold were set up outside the gate, bearing the words: “Chief Guardian of the Inner Palace of the Forbidden Precincts and Imperial Guardsman of the Dragon Imperial Bodyguard.” Facing these across the way a lofty altar had been erected where Buddhist and Taoist priests celebrated mass together. A placard above announced: “Obsequies of the Lady Qin, Consort of the Heir Apparent of the Ning Guo Duke, Chief Guardian of the Inner Palace of the Forbidden Precincts and Imperial Guardsman of the Dragon Imperial Bodyguard.”\n\n“In the central domain of the Four Continents, in the land where eternal peace is established by heavenly mandate, the Most Reverend Wan, Head of the Buddhist Clergy in the Ministry of Rites, Controller of the Void, Silence and Purity of the Order of the Sakya, and the Most Reverend Ye, Head of the Taoist Clergy in the Ministry of Rites, Controller of the Primordial Orthodox Church of Tao, with all reverence prepare this pure feast and worship Heaven and the Buddha.”\n\n“They humbly summon all devas, guardians and divine generals to shed abroad their sacred mercy and display abroad their divine might, that for forty-nine days the holy water may wash away sin and disaster and the assembly may secure peace.”\n\nBut it is impossible to record all the details.\n\nAlthough Jia Zhen was well satisfied, his wife’s illness had taken a turn for the worse and she was unable to help with the entertaining. Afraid that his womenfolk might prove unequal to the task and he be laughed at for their lack of etiquette, he was very much put out. As he was worrying, he noticed Baoyu at his side.\n\n“Everything’s well arranged,” said Baoyu. “Why are you still looking so worried, cousin?”\n\nJia Zhen explained that he had no one to take charge inside.\n\n“That’s no problem,” cried Baoyu. “I’ll recommend someone to act as steward for the month. I guarantee she’ll do all right.”\n\n“Who is it?” asked Jia Zhen eagerly.\n\nBut since the room was full of relatives Baoyu did not like to speak out. He just whispered in Jia Zhen’s ear.\n\nJia Zhen was overjoyed. “That’s an excellent idea,” he said. “I’ll go and ask her at once.” He took Baoyu’s arm and, excusing himself to the others, they went off together.\n\nAs it happened, this was not one of the main days for the funeral and few relatives had come. Only a few ladies of the house were sitting with Lady Xing, Lady Wang and Xifeng. When it was announced that the master had arrived, the serving-women scattered in confusion, leaving Xifeng alone to rise slowly to her feet.\n\nJia Zhen, who was unwell himself and prostrate with grief, came in leaning on a cane. Lady Xing and the others urged him to rest, asking why he had troubled to come in.\n\nLeaning on his cane he forced himself to curtsey to them. Then, declining the seat they offered, he squatted on his heels instead and with a wan smile begged a favour of his aunts and Xifeng.\n\nWhen they asked what it was, he said, “You know, aunts, my daughter-in-law has gone and my wife is laid up. I can see that things are at sixes and seven inside and I’d like to ask my younger cousin to take charge here for a month to put things straight. Then I can stop worrying.”\n\n“So that’s it,” said Lady Xing. “Xifeng is staying with your Second Aunt. Ask her.”\n\n“She’s only a child,” put in Lady Wang. “She’s never managed anything so important. If she bungled it, people would laugh. Better ask someone else.”\n\n“I understand, aunt,” said Jia Zhen with a smile. “You’re afraid she may find it too much of a strain.\n\nShe said, “Since childhood your elder cousin has been decisive and strong- willed. Since her marriage and taking charge of affairs over there she has gained more experience and knows how to handle things. I’ve been thinking these last few days that there’s no one but your elder cousin I can ask. If you won’t do it for my son and daughter-in-law’s sake, aunt, do it for the sake of the dead!” His tears fell as he spoke.\n\nNow Lady Wang was only afraid that Xifeng, having had no experience of funeral ceremonies, might mismanage things and be laughed at. But since Jia Zhen pleaded so hard, she was rather won over. However, her eyes were still fixed thoughtfully on Xifeng, who for her part had always enjoyed managing affairs and liked to show how competent she was. Seeing Jia Zhen beg her like this, she had already agreed in her heart. And since Lady Wang seemed not disinclined to consent, she said to her:\n\n“Cousin Zhen has spoken so sincerely, why not agree, madam?”\n\n“Do you think you can do it?” whispered Lady Wang.\n\n“I don’t see why not. Cousin Zhen has already cleared up the most important business outside. All that has to be done inside is to keep an eye on things. If there’s anything I don’t know, I can ask for your instructions.”\n\nLady Wang found this reasonable. She said no more but looked silent assent.\n\nJia Zhen, seeing that Xifeng had agreed, smiled.\n\n“Of course it’s a lot to ask,” he said. “But I must beg you, cousin, to take this on. Let me first express my thanks. When this is over, I shall come to your house to thank you properly.” With that he clasped his hands and bowed.\n\nXifeng hastily curtseyed in return.\n\nJia Zhen then sent for the tally of the Ning Mansion and ordered Baoyu to hand it to Xifeng.\n\n“Do whatever you think fit, cousin,” he said. “Don’t hesitate to take whatever you need. There’s no need to consult me. I only beg you not to try to economize on my account. The main thing is to do the thing handsomely. And secondly, treat the servants here as you do those in your own house. Don’t be afraid of offending people. Those are my only two requests. I leave everything else to you.”\n\nXifeng was reluctant to take the tally until she saw Lady Wang nod.\n\n“Since your cousin urges you so sincerely, just do your best to help out,” said Lady Wang. “But don’t take it on yourself to make decisions. Send to ask for your cousin’s or his wife’s instructions if any problems crop up.”\n\nBaoyu had already taken the tally from Jia Zhen and pressed it into Xifeng’s hands.\n\n“Will you stay here, cousin, or come over every day?” asked Jia Zhen. “It will be very tiring to come every day. I’ll have a place made ready for you so that you can stay here quietly these next few days.”\n\n“There’s no need,” she replied with a smile. “They can’t do without me over there. I’d better come every day.”\n\n“Very well, as you like.” After a little more small talk he took his leave.\n\nWhen the ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xifeng, “What do you plan to do?”\n\n“Please go back now, madam,” was the answer. “I must first go through the accounts and get things sorted out before I return.”\n\nLady Wang thereupon went back with Lady Xing.\n\nXifeng, having taken a seat in a three-roomed annex, reflected: First, the confusion here may lead to missing things. Second, since no one is assigned specific tasks, they shirk responsibility. Third, the spending is extravagant and there is much padding of expenses. Fourth, no distinction is made between those who work hard and those who idle, so that rewards and penalties are not just. Fifth, the servants are so arrogant that those with authority cannot control them and those without cannot do their work properly.\n\nSuch were the bad customs in the Ning Mansion.\n\nTo know how Xifeng dealt with them, read the next chapter."
