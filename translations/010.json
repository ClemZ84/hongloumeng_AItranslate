  "original": "话说金荣因人多势众，又兼贾瑞勒令赔了不是，给秦钟磕了头，宝玉方才不吵闹了。大家散了学，金荣自己回到家中，越想越气，说：“秦钟不过是贾蓉的小舅子，又不是贾家的子孙，附学读书，也不过和我一样。因他仗着宝玉和他相好，就目中无人。既是这样，就该干些正经事，也没的说；他素日又和宝玉鬼鬼祟祟的，只当人家都是瞎子看不见。今日他又去勾搭人，偏偏撞在我眼里，就是闹出事来，我还怕什么不成？”他母亲胡氏听见他咕咕唧唧的，说：“你又要管什么闲事？好容易我和你姑妈说了，你姑妈又千方百计的和他们西府里琏二奶奶跟前说了，你才得了这个念书的地方儿。若不是仗着人家，咱们家里还有力量请的起先生么？况且人家学里茶饭都是现成的，你这二年在那里念书，家里也省好大的嚼用呢！省出来的，你又爱穿件体面衣裳。再者你不在那里念书，你就认得什么薛大爷了？那薛大爷一年也帮了咱们七八十两银子。你如今要闹出了这个学房，再想找这么个地方儿，我告诉你说罢，比登天的还难呢！你给我老老实实的玩一会子睡你的觉去，好多着呢！”于是金荣忍气吞声，不多一时，也自睡觉去了。次日仍旧上学去了，不在话下。\n　　且说他姑妈原给了贾家“玉”字辈的嫡派，名唤贾璜，但其族人那里皆能象宁荣二府的家势？原不用细说。这贾璜夫妻守着些小小的产业，又时常到宁荣二府里去请安，又会奉承凤姐儿并尤氏，所以凤姐儿尤氏也时常资助资助他，方能加此度日。今日正遇天气晴朗，又值家中无事，遂带了一个婆子，坐上车，来家里走走，瞧瞧嫂子和侄儿。说起话儿来，金荣的母亲偏提起昨日贾家学房里的事，从头至尾，一五一十，都和他小姑子说了。这璜大奶奶不听则已，听了怒从心上起，说道：“这秦钟小杂种是贾门的亲戚，难道荣儿不是贾门的亲戚？也别太势利了！况且都做的是什么有脸的事！就是宝玉也不犯向着他到这个田地。等我到东府里瞧瞧我们珍大奶奶，再和秦钟的姐姐说说，叫他评评理！”金荣的母亲听了，急的了不得，忙说道：“这都是我的嘴快，告诉了姑奶奶，求姑奶奶快别去说罢。别管他们谁是谁非，倘或闹出来，怎么在那里站的住？要站不住，家里不但不能请先生，还得他身上添出许多嚼用来呢。”璜大奶奶说道：“那里管的那些个？等我说了，看是怎么样！”也不容他嫂子劝，一面叫老婆子瞧了车，坐上竟往宁府里来。\n　　到了宁府，进了东角门，下了车，进去见了尤氏，那里还有大气儿？殷殷勤勤叙过了寒温，说了些闲话儿，方问道：“今日怎么没见蓉大奶奶？”尤氏说：“他这些日子不知些日子不知怎么了，经期有两个多月没有来。叫大夫瞧了，又说并不是喜。那两日到下半日就懒怠动了，话也懒怠说，神也发涅。我叫他：‘你且不必拘礼，早晚不必照例上来，你竟养养儿罢。就有亲戚来，还有我呢。别的长辈怪你，等我替你告诉。’连蓉哥儿我都嘱咐了，我说：‘你不许累他，不许招他生气，叫他静静儿的养几天就好了。他要想什么吃，只管到我屋里来取。倘或他有个好歹，你再要娶这么一个媳妇儿，这么个模样儿，这么个性格儿，只怕打着灯笼儿也没处找去呢！他这为人行事儿，那个亲戚长辈儿不喜欢他？所以我这两日心里很烦。偏偏儿的早起他兄弟来瞧他，谁知那小孩子家不知好歹，看见他姐姐身上不好，这些事也不当告诉他，就受了万分委曲也不该向着他说。谁知昨日学房里打架，不知是那里附学的学生，倒欺负他，里头还有些不干不净的话，都告诉了他姐姐。婶子你是知道的，那媳妇虽则见了人有说有笑的，他可心细，不拘听见什么话儿都要付量个三日五夜才算。这病就是打这‘用心太过’上得的。今儿听见有人欺负了他的兄弟．又是恼，又是气。恼的是那狐朋狗友，搬弄是非，调三窝四，气的是为他兄弟不学好，不上心念书，才弄的学房里吵闹。他为这件事，索性连早饭还没吃。我才到他那边解劝了他一会子，又嘱咐了他兄弟几句，我叫他兄弟到那边府里又找宝玉儿去；我又瞧着他吃了半钟儿燕窝汤，我才过来了。婶子，你说我心焦不心焦？况且目今又没个好大夫，我想到他病上，我心里如同针扎的一般。你们知道有什么好大夫没有？”\n　　金氏听了这一番话，把方才在他嫂子家的那一团要向秦氏理论的盛气，早吓的丢在爪洼国去了。听见尤氏问他好大夫的话，连忙答道：“我们也没听见人说什么好大夫。如今听起大奶奶这个病来，定不得还是喜呢。嫂子倒别教人混治，倘若治错了，可了不得！”尤氏道：“正是呢。”说话之间，贾珍从外进来，见了金氏，便问尤氏道：“这不是璜大奶奶么？”金氏向前给贾珍请了安，贾珍向尤氏说：“你让大妹妹吃了饭去。”贾珍说着话便向那屋里去了。金氏此来原要向秦氏说秦钟欺负他侄儿的事，听见秦氏有病，连提也不敢提了。况且贾珍尤氏又待的甚好，因转怒为喜的，又说了一会子闲话，方家去了。\n　　金氏去后，贾珍方过来坐下，问尤氏道：“今日他来又有什么说的？”尤氏答道：“倒没说什么，一进来脸上倒象有些个恼意似的，及至说了半天话儿，又提起媳妇的病，他倒渐渐的气色平和了。你又叫留他吃饭，他听见媳妇这样的病，也不好意思只管坐着，又说了几句话就去了，倒没有求什么事。如今且说媳妇这病，你那里寻一个好大夫给他瞧瞧要紧，可别耽误了。现今咱们家走的这群大夫，那里要得？一个个都是听着人的口气儿，人怎么说，他也添几句文话儿说一遍。可倒殷勤的很，三四个人，一日轮流着，倒有四五遍来看脉！大家商量着立个方儿，吃了也不见效。倒弄的一日三五次换衣裳、坐下起来的见大夫，其实于病人无益。”贾珍道：“可是这孩子也糊涂，何必又脱脱换换的。倘或又着了凉，更添一层病，还了得？任凭什么好衣裳，又值什么呢，孩子的身体要紧，—就是一天穿一套新的，也不值什么。我正要告诉你，方才冯紫英来看我，他见我有些心里烦，问我怎么了，我告诉他媳妇身子不大爽炔，因为不得个好大夫，断不透是喜是病，又不知有妨碍没妨碍，所以我心里实在着急。冯紫英因说他有一个幼时从学的先生，姓张名友士，学问最渊博，更兼医理极精，且能断人的生死。今年是上京给他儿子捐官，现在他家住着呢。这样看来，或者媳妇的病该在他手里除灾也未可定。我已叫人拿我的名帖去请了。今日天晚，或未必来，明日想一定来的。且冯紫英又回家亲替我求他，务必请他来瞧的。等待张先生来瞧了再说罢。”\n　　尤氏听说，心中甚喜，因说：“后日是太爷的寿日，到底怎么个办法？”贾珍说道：“我方才到了太爷那里去请安，兼请太爷来家受一受一家子的礼。太爷因说道：“我是清净惯了的，我不愿意往你们那是非场中去。你们必定说是我的生日，要叫我去受些众人的头，你莫如把我从前注的《阴骘文》给我好好的叫人写出来刻了，比叫我无故受众人的头还强百倍呢。倘或明日后日这两天一家子要来，你就在家里好好的款待他们就是了。也不必给我送什么东西来。连你后日也不必来。你要心中不安，你今日就给我磕了头去。倘或后日你又跟许多人来闹我，我必和你不依。’如此说了，今日我是再不敢去的了。且叫赖升来，吩咐他预备两日的筵席。”\n　　尤氏因叫了贾蓉来：“吩咐赖升照例预备两日的筵席，要丰丰富富的。你再亲自到西府里请老太太．大太太，二太太和你琏二婶子来逛逛。你父亲今日又听见一个好大夫，已经打发人请去了，想明日必来。你可将他这些日子的病症细细的告诉他。”贾蓉一一答应着出去了。正遇着刚才到冯紫英家去请那先生的小子回来了，因回道：“奴才方才到了冯大爷家，拿了老爷名帖请那先生去，那先生说是：‘方才这里大爷也和我说了，但只今日拜了一天的客，才回到家，此时精神实在不能支持，就是去到府上也不能看脉，须得调息一夜，明日务必到府。’他又说：‘医学浅薄，本不敢当此重荐，因冯太爷和府上既已如此说了，又不得不去，你先替我回明大人就是了。大人的名帖着实不敢当。’还叫奴才拿回来了。哥儿替奴才回一声儿罢。”贾蓉复转身进去，回了贾珍、尤氏的话，方出来叫了赖升，吩咐预备两日的筵席的话。赖升答应，自去照例料理，不在话下。\n　　且说次日午间，门上人回道：“请的那张先生来了。”贾珍遂延入大厅坐下。茶毕，方开言道：“昨日承冯大爷示知老先生人品学问，又兼深通医学，小弟不胜钦敬。”张先生道：“晚生粗鄙下士，知识浅陋。昨因冯大爷示知，大人家第谦恭下士，又承呼唤，不敢违命。但毫无实学，倍增汗颜。”贾珍道：“先生不必过谦，就请先生进去看看儿妇，仰仗高明，以释下怀。”于是贾蓉同了进去，到了内室，见了秦氏，向贾蓉说道：“这就是尊夫人了？”贾蓉道：“正是。请先生坐下，让我把贱内的病症说一说再看脉如何？”那先生道：“依小弟意下，竟先看脉，再请教病源为是。我初造尊府，本也不知道什么，但我们冯大爷务必叫小弟过来看看，小弟所以不得不来。如今看了脉息，看小弟说得是不是，再将这些日子的病势讲一讲，大家斟酌一个方儿。可用不可用，那时大爷再定夺就是了。”贾蓉道：“先生实在高明，如今恨相见之晚。就请先生看一看脉息可治不可治，得以使家父母放心。”于是家下媳妇们，捧过大迎枕来，一面给秦氏靠着，一面拉着袖口，露出手腕来。这先生方伸手按在右手脉上，调息了至数，凝神细诊了半刻工夫。换过左手，亦复如是。诊毕了，说道：“我们外边去坐罢。”\n　　贾蓉于是同先生到外边屋里炕上坐了。一个婆子端了茶来，贾蓉道：“先生请茶。”茶毕，问道：“先生看这脉息还治得治不得？”先生说：“看得尊夫人脉息，左寸沉数，左关沉伏，右寸细而无力，右关虚而无神。其左寸沉数者，乃心气虚而生火；左关沉伏者，乃肝家气滞血亏。右寸细而无力者，乃肺经气分太虚；有关虚而无神者，乃脾土被肝木克制。心气虚而生火者，应现今经期不调，夜间不寐。肝家血亏气滞者，应胁下痛胀，月信过期，心中发热。肺经气分太虚者，头目不时眩晕，寅卯间必然自汗，如坐舟中。脾土被肝木克制者，必定不思饮食，精神倦怠，四肢酸软。据我看这脉，当有这些症候才对。或以这个为喜脉，则小弟不敢闻命矣。”旁边一个贴身伏侍的婆子道：“何尝不是这样呢，真正先生说得如神，倒不用我们说了。如今我们家里现有好几位太医老爷瞧着呢，都不能说得这样真切。有的说道是喜，有的说道是病，这位说不相干，这位又说怕冬至前后，总没有个真著话儿。求老爷明白指示指示。那先生说：“大奶奶这个症候，可是众位耽搁了。要在初次行经的时候就用药治起，只怕此时已全愈了。如今既是把病耽误到这地位，也是应有此灾。依我看起来，病倒尚有三分治得。吃了我这药看，若是夜间睡的着觉，那时又添了二分拿手了。据我看这脉息，大奶奶是个心性高强、聪明不过的人。但聪明太过，则不如意事常有，不如意事常有，则思虑太过，此病是忧虑伤脾，肝木忒旺，经血所以不能按时而至。大奶奶从前行经的日子问一问，断不是常缩，必是常长的。是不是？”这婆子答道：“可不是！从没有缩过，或是长两日三日，以至十日不等，都长过的。”先生听道：“是了，这就是病源了。从前若能以养心调气之药服之，何至于此。这如今明显出一个水亏火旺的症候来。待我用药看。”于是写了方子，递与贾蓉，上写的是：\n　　　　益气养荣补脾和肝汤\n　　　　人参二钱 白术二钱土炒 云苓三钱 熟地四钱 归身二钱 白\n　　　　芍二钱 川芎一钱五分 黄芪三钱 香附米二钱 醋柴胡八分 淮山\n　　　　药二钱抄 真阿胶二钱 延胡索钱半酒炒 炙甘草八分 引用建莲子\n　　　　七粒去心、大枣二枚\n　　贾蓉看了说：“高明的很。还要请教先生，这病与性命终久有妨无妨？”先生笑道：“大爷是最高明的人，人病到这个地位，非一朝一夕的症候了，吃了这药，也要看医缘了。依小弟看来，今年一冬是不相干的；总是过了春分，就可望全愈了。”贾蓉也是个聪明人，也不往下细问了。\n　　于是贾蓉送了先生去了，方将这药方子并脉案都给贾珍看了，说的话也都回了贾珍并尤氏了。尤氏向贾珍道：“从来大夫不象他说的痛快，想必用药不错的。”贾珍笑道：“他原不是那等混饭吃久惯行医的人，因为冯紫英我们相好，他好容易求了他来的。既有了这个人，媳妇的病或者就能好了。他那方子上有人参，就用前日买的那一斤好的罢。”贾蓉听毕了话，方出来叫人抓药去煎给秦氏吃。不知秦氏服了此药，病势如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Jin Rong had had to apologize and kotow to Qin Zhong only because he was outnumbered and Jia Rui had forced him to; but Baoyu’s intervention had put a stop to the row. When school was dismissed Jin Rong went home in a worse temper than ever.\n\n“Qin Zhong’s nothing but the brother of Jia Rong’s wife,” he grumbled. “He’s not a Jia himself. He’s only attending their school on sufferance, same as me. Yet just because he’s Baoyu’s friend he looks down on everyone else. If he were up to anything decent, there’d be some excuse; but he and Baoyu are always carrying on in a hole-and-corner way. They must think people are blind. I’d nothing to do with them, but today they tried to get fresh with me. If I’d made a row, what would I have had to fear?”\n\n“What business is it of yours?” demanded his mother Hu-shi when she overheard these mutterings. “It wasn’t easy for me to get you into that school. I had to plead with your aunt, and she had to use all her ingenuity to get round Madam Lian of the West Mansion before they’d take you. If we had to depend on ourselves, how could we afford a tutor? Besides, you get your meals free at school. These last two years you’ve been there we’ve saved quite a bit on food, and that’s made it possible for you to have some smart clothes. What’s more, if you weren’t at that school would you ever have met Lord Xue? He gives us seventy or eighty taels a year. If you go and quarrel your way out of that school, don’t imagine you’ll find another place like it. I tell you, that would be harder than climbing up to heaven. Be sensible now and have a good game, then go to bed.”\n\nSo Jin Rong had to swallow his anger and after a while turned in. The next day he went back to school as if nothing had happened.\n\nNow his aunt had married Jia Huang of the Jia clan. But none of its other members could compare with the Ning and Rong Mansions in wealth and influence. The Huang couple had only a small property and lived in straitened circumstances, but they often called at the Ning and Rong Mansions to pay their respects. And because Jia Huang’s wife knew how to ingratiate herself with Xifeng and Madam You, the two ladies often helped her out with presents of money. Thus they were able to manage.\n\nIt so happened that one fine day when she had nothing to do at home, Mrs. Huang called on her sister-in-law, taking an old serving-woman with her in the carriage. In the course of conversation Jin Rong’s mother described in detail all that had happened the previous day in the school. This made Mrs. Huang furious.\n\n“Is this Qin Zhong only a relative of the Jias?” she cried. “Isn’t my nephew a relative too? I’m not saying which of them is in the right, but the school’s run for the whole clan. It’s not for us to be too calculating. Still, whatever happens, a young fellow should know how to behave. If he does something disgraceful, even Baoyu has no business to take his part. I’m going to the East Mansion to see Madam You and have a word with Qin Zhong’s sister. I’ll ask her to judge who’s right.”\n\n“It’s all my fault for shooting off my mouth,” said Jin Rong’s mother in consternation. “Do calm down, sister-in-law. It doesn’t matter which of them was to blame. If you make an issue of this, how can my boy stay on at that school? And if he has to leave, not only shall we not be able to afford a tutor, but we’ll have to spend more on his keep as well.”\n\n“Never you mind. I mean to have this out.”\n\nIgnoring her sister-in-law’s protests, Mrs. Huang ordered her carriage and drove to the Ning Mansion.\n\nShe entered by the east side gate, alighted and went in to see Madam You, who was chatting with some ladies in the drawing-room. When Mrs. Huang saw them, after exchanging greetings and a few polite remarks she asked, “Where is your daughter-in-law today? I don’t see her.”\n\nMadam You continued, “She hasn’t been at all well these last few days. It’s more than two months since she had her courses. We sent for a doctor and he says it’s not a pregnancy. The last couple of days she’s been too tired to move or even talk by the afternoon, and just mopes. I told her, ‘Don’t stand on ceremony. There’s no need for you to come here morning and evening. Just take things easy. If any relatives call, I’ll see to them. If the older generation are annoyed, I’ll explain for you.’ I even gave Rong a talking-to. I said, ‘Don’t you go worrying her or doing anything to upset her. Let her rest quietly for a few days until she’s better. If she fancies anything special to eat, just come and get it from my place. If anything happens to her, where d’you think you’ll find another wife like her — as pretty as a picture and so good-tempered too? You could search with a lantern and never find her equal. All our relatives and the older generation think the world of her. That’s why I’m so worried.”\n\n“Now this morning her brother came to see her. But young people are so thoughtless. He ought to have realized that she was in no fit state to hear about such things. Even if he’d been terribly wronged he shouldn’t have told her. However, it seems there was a fight in the school and some wretched boy — I’ve no idea who — bullied him and used dirty language. He came and told his sister all about it. You know what she’s like, aunt: for all she’s so cheerful and sociable, she’s highly strung and broods over the least little thing for days on end. This illness of hers is the result of worrying too much. When she heard that her brother had been bullied she was both angry and upset: angry with those dirty dogs for stirring up trouble and making mischief, upset because her brother doesn’t study properly or work hard, which is what led to this fight in the school. She was so upset, she couldn’t even eat her breakfast. I went over just now to comfort her and gave her brother a piece of my mind. I told him to go to the other mansion to see Bao-yu. I made her swallow some birdsnest soup too before I came away. Don’t you think I’ve enough to worry me, aunt? And on top of everything, we can’t find a good doctor. The thought of her illness is like a dagger in my heart. Do any of you know of a good doctor?”\n\nAll this had quite deflated Mrs. Huang’s indignation. In answer to the question about a doctor she promptly replied:\n\n“I’m afraid we don’t know of anybody. But from what you tell me, madam, it may be that your daughter-in-law is pregnant after all. You shouldn’t let just any doctor treat her. If he makes a mistake, the consequences may be serious.”\n\n“Exactly,” agreed Madam You.\n\nJust then Jia Zhen came in and, catching sight of Mrs. Huang, asked his wife, “Isn’t this Aunt Huang?” Mrs. Huang stepped forward to greet him.\n\n“Don’t let Aunt Huang go without having a meal,” he said to his wife, then went into the inner room.\n\nMrs. Huang had come meaning to have things out with Qin-shi about Qin Zhong’s bullying of her nephew. The news of the young woman’s illness made her keep quiet about this. Besides, Jia Zhen and his wife had treated her so politely that her anger turned to pleasure. After a little more conversation she went home.\n\nWhen she had gone, Jia Zhen came back and sat down.\n\n“What did she want today?” he asked.\n\n“Nothing special,” said his wife. “When she first came in she looked rather put out, but after chatting for a time and hearing how unwell my daughter-in-law is, she gradually calmed down. Then you asked us to keep her for a meal. When she heard that my daughter-in-law...”\n\n\"An illness like this makes it embarrassing for guests to stay long. After a few more remarks he left, without asking any favour. But now about your daughter-in-law’s illness: you must find a good doctor to examine her. On no account let it drag on. None of the physicians we usually employ are any good. They all take their cue from us, saying just what we want to hear in high-flown language, and they’re so damned solicitous. Three or four of them take it in turn to come four or five times a day to feel her pulse. Then they put their heads together to decide on a prescription, but the medicine does no good at all. In fact, all the patient gets out of it is the fatigue of changing her clothes three or five times a day to receive the doctors, getting up and sitting down again. It’s really bad for her.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Jia Zhen. \"The silly child! Why should she change her clothes? If she catches more cold, that will make her worse. Whatever happens, her health is what matters. Even if she wore a new outfit every day, that would be nothing. I meant to tell you, Feng Ziying came just now to see me. He could tell I was worried and asked what was the matter. When I told him my daughter-in-law was unwell and we hadn’t found a good doctor who could say whether it’s a pregnancy or an illness, or whether it’s serious or not, he saw how anxious I was. He told me that a former tutor of his, a Mr. Zhang You-shi, is a very learned man and a brilliant physician, who can foretell whether a patient will live or die. He has come to the capital this year to purchase a post for his son and is staying in their house. It may be that our daughter-in-law’s fate is to be cured by him. I’ve already sent a servant with my card to invite him here. It’s rather late today, so he may not come, but I’ve no doubt he’ll come tomorrow. What’s more, Feng Ziying promised to go home and plead with him to be sure to come. So we’d better wait for Dr. Zhang’s diagnosis.\"\n\nMadam You was overjoyed by this news.\n\n\"The day after tomorrow is the old master’s birthday,\" she said. \"What are we going to do about it?\"\n\n\"I’ve just been to pay my respects and invite him to come home on that day to receive the congratulations of the whole family. But he said, ‘I’m used to a quiet life and have no wish to expose myself to your world of strife. If you insist on celebrating my birthday, instead of asking me to accept the homage of a crowd of people, you’d do better to have the sutra I annotated copied out and printed. That would please me a hundred times more than being kowtowed to for no reason. If the family wants to come on the first or second day, entertain them well here at home. There’s no need to send me anything, and you needn’t come yourself either. If you’re worried about not doing the right thing, you can kowtow to me now. But if on the second day you come with a crowd of people to disturb me, I shall be very annoyed.’ After that, of course, I didn’t venture to press him. I’ll send for Lai Sheng and tell him to prepare a feast for two days.\"\n\nMadam You accordingly sent for Jia Rong and told him, \"Go and order Lai Sheng to prepare a two days’ feast in the usual way, and see that it’s a sumptuous one. Then go in person to the other mansion to invite the old lady, Lady Xing, Lady Wang and your Second Aunt Lian to come and enjoy themselves. Your father has just heard of a good doctor and has sent to invite him. I expect he’ll come tomorrow. You can give him a detailed account of your wife’s illness.\"\n\nJia Rong assented and left. Just outside, he met the servant who had been sent to Mr. Feng’s to fetch the doctor.\n\n\"Your slave went to Mr. Feng’s house with the master’s card to invite that doctor,\" reported the man. \"He said, ‘I’ve just been talking to your master about this, but I’ve been out all day paying calls and only just got back. I’m so tired now...’\"\n\nUnable to come, he said. And even if he did he wouldn’t be able to diagnose the illness. He needs a night’s rest and will definitely call tomorrow. He also said, “My skill is poor, I don’t deserve such a recommendation. But since Master Feng and your household have already spoken of this, I’ve no choice but to come. Please inform your master for me. I really cannot accept his card.” With that he sent me back. Will you report this, young master?”\n\nChia Jung turned and went in to tell Chia Chen and Madam Yu, after which he came out again and ordered Lai Sheng to prepare a feast for the next day. Lai Sheng assented and went about his business as usual.\n\nThe next day at noon the gateman announced, “Dr. Chang has come.” Chia Chen conducted him to the main hall and invited him to be seated. After tea he said:\n\n“Yesterday my friend Feng Tang told me of your outstanding virtues and great learning, as well as your profound knowledge of medicine. This filled me with the utmost respect.”\n\n“I am a vulgar, ignorant fellow,” replied Chang. “My knowledge is superficial. Yesterday Master Feng told me that your household is so condescending as to think of an unworthy like myself, and since you sent for me I did not like to refuse. But I have no real learning and feel thoroughly ashamed.”\n\n“Don’t be over-modest, sir. I beg you to examine my daughter-in-law. We shall rely on your superior skill to set our minds at rest.”\n\nThen Chia Jung took the doctor inside to the sick-room. When he saw Ke-ching he asked, “Is this the honourable lady?”\n\n“Yes,” said Chia Jung. “Please be seated. Let me describe her symptoms before you feel her pulse.”\n\n“If I may make so bold, I would prefer to feel the lady’s pulse first before asking about the symptoms. Although I know nothing of your honourable household, Master Feng insisted that I should come. Now, after feeling the pulse, I shall venture to describe the symptoms. If I am correct you can tell me how the illness has developed of late, and then we can decide on a prescription. The master of the house can judge whether it is acceptable or not.”\n\n“How discerning you are, sir! I only regret that we did not meet sooner. Please feel her pulse and tell us whether the case is serious or not, so that my parents can set their minds at rest.”\n\nSome matrons then brought a cushion and helped Ke-ching to rest her arm on it, pushing up her sleeve to bare the wrist. The doctor felt her right pulse first, placing his fingers on the pulse and concentrating for some minutes. Then he felt the left pulse. Having finished he said, “Let us go outside to sit down.”\n\nChia Jung conducted the doctor to the outer room, where they sat on the kang and a maid served tea.\n\n“Please take some tea,” said Chia Jung.\n\nWhen they had drunk it he asked, “What is your opinion of my wife’s pulse, sir? Can she be cured?”\n\n“The honourable lady’s pulse on the left wrist is deep and rapid, that on the left middle is faint and sluggish; on the right wrist it is faint and feeble, on the right middle weak and listless. The deep, rapid pulse on the left wrist indicates a weak heart subject to fire; the faint, sluggish pulse on the left middle shows that the liver’s energy and blood are low. The faint, feeble pulse on the right wrist means that the lung is enervated; the weak, listless pulse on the right middle that the earth element of the spleen is overcome by the wood element of the liver.\n\n“The weak heart subject to fire should cause irregular menstruation and insomnia. The low energy and blood of the liver should cause pain and distension below the ribs, delayed menstruation and feverishness. The enervated lung should cause intermittent dizziness and sweating at dawn, with a feeling of dizziness. The earth element of the spleen being overcome by the wood element of the liver should cause loss of appetite, lassitude and weakness of the limbs.\n\n“In my opinion, these should be the symptoms. If anyone takes this for pregnancy, that is something beyond my comprehension.”\n\n“How right you are!” cried an old nurse who was standing by. “We’ve no need to tell you the symptoms, sir. You know them better than we do.\n\nSeveral doctors have seen her, but none could give so exact a diagnosis. Some said it was a pregnancy, others that it was an illness. One doctor said it didn’t matter, another that we must watch out around the winter solstice. Not one of them could give a definite opinion. We beg you, sir, to tell us frankly what you think.\n\n“This illness of your daughter-in-law’s has been neglected by all those doctors,” said the doctor. “If she’d been given the right treatment the first time she missed her periods, she’d be well by now. But the case has been mishandled and she’s had this relapse. Still, in my opinion, there’s three parts hope. If after taking my medicine she can sleep well at night, that will bring it up to five parts hope.\n\n“According to her pulse, your daughter-in-law is an intelligent, highly strung woman. But too much intelligence leads to frequent frustration, and frustration to excessive anxiety. This illness has been caused by fretting which has injured her spleen and over-stimulated the liver, so that the menses are delayed. If you ask on what dates she used to have them, I’m sure you’ll find they weren’t early but always late. Am I right?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, sir,” cried the woman. “She never had them early. Sometimes it was two or three days late, sometimes more — up to ten days or a fortnight.”\n\n“There you are! That explains it. If she’d been given tonics to regulate her system, this would never have happened. Now it’s a clear case of deficiency of water and preponderance of fire. Wait and see what my medicine does.”\n\nThereupon he wrote out a prescription and handed it to Jia Rong. On it were listed:\n\nGINSENG TONIC TO REPLENISH THE HEART AND REGULATE THE LIVER\n\nGinseng (2 qian) White atractylis (2 qian, fried with earth) Poria (3 qian) Cooked rehmannia (4 qian) Angelica (2 qian) White peony (2 qian) Chuanxiong (1.5 qian) Astragalus (3 qian) Cyperus (2 qian) Vinegar-prepared bupleurum (0.8 qian) Yam (2 qian, stir-baked) Genuine donkey-hide gelatin (2 qian) Vinegar-fried corydalis tuber (1.5 qian) Licorice (0.8 qian, roasted) With seven lotus seeds, with the shoots removed, and two red dates as a guide.\n\n“This looks first-rate,” said Jia Rong. “But may I ask whether this illness is dangerous or not?”\n\n“You’re an intelligent man, sir,” replied the doctor with a smile. “When an illness has reached this stage, it isn’t something that’s developed in a day. This medicine will take effect if she has the luck to recover. In my humble opinion, she should be all right this winter. After the spring equinox next year, we can hope for a cure.”\n\nJia Rong was too intelligent to press the question. He saw the doctor out and then showed the prescription and the diagnosis to Jia Zhen, reporting all that had been said to him and Madam You.\n\n“None of the other doctors spoke so frankly,” remarked Madam You to her husband. “I’m sure his prescription will be all right.”\n\n“He’s not one of those quacks who make a living from medicine,” said Jia Zhen. “It was only because he’s a friend of Feng Ziying’s that we were able to get him to come. Since we’ve found such a good man, there’s hope for our daughter-in-law after all.” He noticed that the prescription included ginseng. “Use that pound of best-quality ginseng we bought the other day,” he ordered.\n\nJia Rong assented and went out to see that the medicine was prepared and given to Keqing.\n\nTo know whether it took effect or not, read the next chapter."
