  "original": "却说王夫人唤上金钏的母亲来，拿了几件簪环当面赏了，又吩咐：“请几众僧人念经超度他。”金钏的母亲磕了头，谢了出去。\n　　原来宝玉会过雨村回来，听见金钏儿含羞自尽，心中早已五内摧伤，进来又被王夫人数说教训了一番，也无可回说。看见宝钗进来，方得便走出，茫然不知何往，背着手，低着头，一面感叹，一面慢慢的信步走至厅上。刚转过屏门，不想对面来了一人正往里走，可巧撞了个满怀。只听那人喝一声：“站住！”宝玉唬了一跳，抬头看时，不是别人，却是他父亲。早不觉倒抽了一口凉气，只得垂手一旁站着。贾政道：“好端端的，你垂头丧气的什么？方才雨村来了要见你，那半天才出来。既出来了，全无一点慷慨挥洒的谈吐，仍是委委琐琐的。我看你脸上一团私欲愁闷气色，这会子又嗳声叹气，你那些还不足、还不自在？无故这样，是什么原故？”宝玉素日虽然口角伶俐，此时一心却为金钏儿感伤，恨不得也身亡命殒；如今见他父亲说这些话，究竟不曾听明白了，只是怔怔的站着。\n　　贾政见他惶悚，应对不似往日，原本无气的，这一来倒生了三分气。方欲说话，忽有门上人来回：“忠顺亲王府里有人来，要见老爷。”贾政听了，心下疑惑，暗暗思忖道：“素日并不与忠顺府来往，为什么今日打发人来？”一面想，一面命：“快请厅上坐。”急忙进内更衣。出来接见时，却是忠顺府长府官，一面彼此见了礼，归坐献茶。未及叙谈，那长府官先就说道：“下官此来，并非擅造潭府，皆因奉命而来，有一件事相求。看王爷面上，敢烦老先生做主，不但王爷知情，且连下官辈亦感谢不尽。”贾政听了这话，摸不着头脑，忙陪笑起身问道：“大人既奉王命而来，不知有何见谕？望大人宣明，学生好遵逾承办。”那长府官冷笑道：“也不必承办，只用老先生一句话就完了。我们府里有一个做小旦的琪官，一向好好在府，如今竟三五日不见回去，各处去找，又摸不着他的道路。因此各处察访，这一城内十停人倒有八停人都说：他近日和衔玉的那位令郎相与甚厚。下官辈听了，尊府不比别家，可以擅来索取，因此启明王爷。王爷亦说：‘若是别的戏子呢，一百个也罢了；只是这琪官，随机应答，谨慎老成，甚合我老人家的心境，断断少不得此人。’故此求老先生转致令郎，请将琪官放会。一则可慰王爷纯纯奉恳之意，二则下官辈也可操劳求觅之苦。”说毕，忙打一躬。\n　　贾政听了这话，又惊又气，即命唤宝玉出来。宝玉也不知是何缘故，忙忙赶来，贾政便问：“该死的奴才！你在家不读书也罢了，怎么又做出这些无法无天的事来！那琪官现是忠顺王爷驾前承奉的人，你是何等草莽，无故引逗他出来，如今祸及于我！”宝玉听了，唬了一跳，忙回道：“实在不知此事。究竟‘琪官’两个字，不知为何物，况更加以‘引逗’二字！”说着便哭。贾政未及开口，只见那长府官冷笑道：“公子也不必隐饰。或藏在家，或知其下落，早说出来，我们也少受些辛苦，岂不念公子之德呢！”宝玉连说：“实在不知。恐是讹传也未见得。”那长府官冷笑两声道：“现有证据，必定当着老大人说出来，公子岂不吃亏？既说不知，此人那红汗巾子怎得到了公子腰里？”宝玉听了这话，不觉轰了魂魄，目瞪口呆。心下自思：“这话他如何知道？他既连这样机密事都知道了，大约别的瞒不过他。不加打发他去了，免得再说出别的事来。”因说道：“大人既知他的底细，如何连他置买房舍这样大事倒不晓得了。听得说他如今在东郊离城二十里有个什么紫檀堡，他在那里置了几亩田地，几间房舍。想是在那里也未可知。”那长府官听了，笑道：“这样说，一定是在那里了。我且去找一回，若有了便罢；若没有，还要来请教。”说着，便忙忙的告辞走了。\n　　贾政此时气得目瞪口歪，一面送那官员，一面回头命宝玉：“不许动！回来有话问你！”一直送那官去了。才回身时，忽见贾环带着几个小厮一阵乱跑。贾政喝命小厮：“给我快打！”贾环见了他父亲，吓得骨软筋酥，赶忙低头站住。贾政便问：“你跑什么？带着你的那些人都不管你，不知往那里去，由你野马一般！”喝叫：“跟上学的人呢？”贾环见他父亲甚怒，便乘机说道：“方才原不曾跑，只因从那井边一过，那井里淹死了一个丫头，我看脑袋这么大，身子这么粗，泡的实在可怕，所以才赶着跑过来了。”贾政听了，惊疑问道：“好端端，谁去跳井？我家从无这样事情。自祖宗以来，皆是宽柔待下，大约我近年于家务疏懒，自然执事人操克夺之权，致使弄出这暴殒轻生的祸来。若外人知道，祖宗的颜面何在！”喝命：“叫贾琏、赖大来！”小厮们答应了一声，方欲去叫，贾环忙上前拉住贾政袍襟，贴膝跪下道：“老爷不用生气。此事除太太屋里的人，别人一点也不知道。我听见我母亲说……”说到这句，便回头四顾一看。贾政知其意，将眼色一丢，小厮们明白，都往两边后面退去。贾环便悄悄说道：“我母亲告诉我说：宝玉哥哥前口在太太屋里，拉着太太的丫头金钏儿，强奸不遂，打了一顿，金钏儿便赌气投井死了。”\n　　话未说完，把个贾政气得面如金纸，大叫：“拿宝玉来！”一面说，一面便往书房去，喝命：“今日再有人来劝我，我把这冠带家私，一应就交与他和宝玉过去！我免不得做个罪人，把这几根烦恼鬓毛剃去，寻个干净去处自了，也免得上辱先人，下生逆子之罪！”众门客仆从见贾政这个形景，便知又是为宝玉了，一个个咬指吐舌，连忙退出。贾政喘吁吁直挺挺的坐在椅子上，满面泪痕，一叠连声：“拿宝玉来！拿大棍拿绳来！把门都关上！有人传信到里头去，立刻打死！”众小厮们只得齐齐答应着，有几个来找宝玉。\n　　那宝玉听见贾政吩咐他“不许动”，早知凶多吉少，那里知道贾环又添了许多的话？正在厅上旋转，怎得个人往里头捎信，偏偏的没个人来，连焙茗也不知在那里。正盼望时，只见一个老妈妈出来。宝玉如得了珍宝，便赶上来拉他，说道：“快进去告诉，老爷要打我呢！快去，快去！要紧，要紧！”宝玉一则急了说话不明白，二则老婆子偏偏又耳聋，不曾听见是什么话，把“要紧”二字只听做“跳井”二字，便笑道：“跳井让他跳去，二爷怕什么？”宝玉见是个聋子，便着急道：“你出去叫我的小厮来罢！”那婆子道：“有什么不了的事？老早的完了。太太又赏了银子，怎么不了事呢？”\n　　宝玉急的手脚正没抓寻处，只见贾政的小厮走来，逼着他出去了。贾政一见，眼都红了，也不暇问他在外流荡优伶，表赠私物，在家荒疏学业，逼淫母婢，只喝命：“堵起嘴来，着实打死！”小厮们不敢违，只得将宝玉按在凳上，举起大板，打了十来下。宝玉自知不能讨饶，只是呜呜的哭。贾政还嫌打的轻，一脚踢开掌板的，自己夺过板子来，狠命的又打了十几下。宝玉生来未经过这样苦楚，起先觉得打的疼不过还乱嚷乱哭，后来渐渐气弱声嘶，呜咽不出。众门客见打的不祥了，赶着上来，恳求夺劝。贾政那里肯听？说道：“你们问问他干的勾当，可饶不可饶！素日皆是你们这些人把他酿坏了，到这步田地，还来劝解！明日酿到他轼父弑君，你们才不劝不成？”众人听这话不好，知道气急了，忙乱着觅人进去给信。王夫人听了，不及去回贾母，便忙穿衣出来，也不顾有人没人，忙忙扶了一个丫头赶往书房中来，慌得众门客小厮等避之不及。\n　　贾政正要在打，一见王夫人进来，更加火上浇油，那板子越下去的又狠又快。按宝玉的两个小厮忙松手走开，宝玉早已动弹不得了。贾政还欲打时，早被王夫人抱住板子。贾政道：“罢了，罢了！今日必定要气死我才罢！”王夫人哭道：“宝玉虽然该打，老爷也要保重。且炎暑天气，老太太身上又不大好，打死宝玉事小，倘或老太太一时不自在了，岂不事大？”贾政冷笑道：“倒休提这话！我养了这不肖的孽障，我已不孝；平昔教训他一番，又有众人护持。不如趁今日结果了他的狗命，以绝将来之患！”说着，便要绳来勒死。王夫人连忙抱住哭道：“老爷虽然应当管教儿子，也要看夫妻分上。我如今已五十岁的人，只有这个孽障，必定苦苦的以他为法，我也不敢深劝。今日越发要弄死他，岂不是有意绝我呢！既要勒死他，索性先勒死我，再勒死他！我们娘儿们不如一同死了，在阴司里也得个倚靠。”说毕，抱住宝玉，放声大哭起来。\n　　贾政听了此话，不觉长叹一声，向椅上坐了，泪如雨下。王夫人抱着宝玉，只见他面白气弱，底下穿着一条绿纱小衣，一片皆是血渍。禁不住解下汗巾去，由腿看至臀股，或青或紫，或整或破，竟无一点好处，不觉失声大哭起“苦命的儿”来。因哭出“苦命儿”来，又想起贾珠来，便叫着贾珠哭道：“若有你活着，便死一百个我也不管了！”此时里面的人闻得王夫人出来，李纨、凤姐及迎、探妹妹两个也都出来了。王夫人哭着贾珠的名字，别人还可，惟有李纨禁不住也抽抽搭搭的哭起来了。贾政听了，那泪更似走珠一般滚了下来。\n　　正没开交处，忽听丫鬟来说：“老太太来了！”一言未了，只听窗外颤巍巍的声气说道：“先打死我，再打死他，就干净了！”贾政见母亲来了，又急又痛，连忙迎出来。只见贾母扶着丫头，摇头喘气的走来。贾政上前躬身陪笑说道：“大暑热的天，老太太有什么吩咐，何必自己走来，只叫儿子进去吩咐便了。”贾母听了，便止步喘息，一面厉声道：“你原来和我说话！我倒有话吩咐，只是我一生没养个好儿子，却叫我和谁说去！”贾政听这话不象，忙跪下含泪说道：“儿子管他，也为的是光宗耀祖。老太太这话，儿子如何当的起？”贾母听说，便啐了一口，说道：“我说了一句话，你就禁不起！你那样下死手的板子，难道宝玉儿就禁的起了？你说教训儿子是光宗耀祖，当日你父亲怎么教训你来着。”说着也不觉泪往下流。贾政又陪笑道：“老太太也不必伤感，都是儿子一时性急，从此以后再不打他了。”贾母便冷笑两声道：“你也不必和我赌气，你的儿子，自然你要打就打。想来你也厌烦我们娘儿们，不如我们早离了你，大家干净。”说着，便令人：“去看轿！我和你太太、宝玉儿立刻回南京去！”家下人只得答应着。贾母又叫王夫人道：“你也不必哭了。如今宝玉儿年纪小，你疼他；他将来长大，为官作宦的，也未必想着你是他母亲了。你如今倒是不疼他，只怕将还少生一口气呢！”贾政听说，忙叩头说道：“母亲如此说，儿子无立足之地了。”贾母冷笑道：“你分明使我无立足之地，你反说起你来！只是我们回去了，你心里干净，看有谁来不许你打！”一面说，一面只命：“快打点行李车辆轿马回去！”贾政直挺挺跪着，叩头谢罪。\n　　贾母一面说，一面来看宝玉。只见今日这顿打不比往日，又是心疼，又是生气，也抱着哭个不了。王夫人与凤姐等解劝了一会，方渐浙的止住。早有丫鬟媳妇等上来要搀宝玉。凤姐便骂：“糊涂东西，也不睁开眼瞧瞧，这个样儿，怎么搀着走的？还不快进去把那藤屉子春凳抬出来呢！”众人听了，连忙飞跑进去，果然抬出春凳来，将宝玉放上，随着贾母、王夫人等进去，送至贾母屋里。\n　　彼时贾政见贾母怒气未消，不敢自便，也跟着进来。看看宝玉果然打重了，再看看王夫人一声“肉”一声“儿”的哭道：“你替珠儿早死了，留着珠儿，也免你父亲生气，我也不白操这半世的心了！这会子你倘或有个好歹，撂下我，叫我靠那一个？”数落一场，又哭“不争气的儿”。贾政听了，也就灰心自己不该下毒手打到如此地步。先劝贾母，贾母含泪说道：“儿子不好，原是要管的，不该打到这个分儿。你不出去，还在这里做什么，难道于心不足，还要眼看着他死了才算吗？”贾政听说，方诺诺的退出去了。\n此时薛姨妈、宝钗、香菱、袭人、湘云等也都在这里。袭人满心委屈，只不好十分使出来。见众人围着，灌水的灌水，打扇的打扇，自己插不下手去，便索性走出门，到二门前，命小厮们找了焙茗来细问：“方才好端端的，为什么打起来？你也不早来透个信儿！”焙茗急的说：“偏我没在跟前，打到半中间，我才听见了。忙打听原故，却是为琪官儿和金钏儿姐姐的事。”袭人道：“老爷怎么知道了？”焙茗道：“那琪官儿的事，多半是薛大爷素昔吃醋，没法儿出气，不知在外头挑唆了谁来，在老爷跟前下的蛆。那金钏儿姐姐的事，大约是三爷说的，我也是听见跟老爷的人说。”袭人听了这两件事都对景，心中也就信了八九分。然后回来，只见众人都替宝玉疗治。调停完备，贾母命：“好生抬到他屋里去。”众人一声答应，七手八脚，忙把宝玉送入怡红院内自己床上卧好。又乱了半日，众人渐渐的散去了，袭人方才进前来，经心服侍细问。\n要知端底究竟如何，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "Lady Wang thereupon sent for Jinchuan’s mother and gave her some trinkets in person, then ordered several monks to be engaged to say masses for her daughter’s salvation.\n\nAfter calling on Yucun, Baoyu had come home to hear that Jinchuan had drowned herself for shame. He was already heart-broken when he entered, only to be reproached by his mother. And as he had no answer to make, he was glad to slip out when Baochai came in. Not knowing where to go, he wandered aimlessly along with his hands behind his back and his head bent, sighing. He had just reached the entrance hall when he ran head on into someone coming from the opposite direction.\n\n“Stop!” cried a stern voice.\n\nBaoyu started with fright and looked up. There stood his father. He instinctively straightened up and dropped his hands to his sides.\n\n“What are you sighing and moaning about?” demanded Jia Zheng. “What’s made you so down in the mouth? Just now when Yucun wanted to see you, you were a long time coming out. And when you did appear you had none of a young gentleman’s spirited demeanour — you looked quite apathetic. Now here you are sighing. You don’t still feel hard done by, I hope? What have you to complain of?”\n\nAlthough normally glib enough, Baoyu was so preoccupied with grief for Jinchuan that he would gladly have died too. He had not taken in a word of this reproof, but simply stood there in a daze.\n\nHis stupefied air, so different from his usual manner, made Jia Zheng, who had not been particularly angry to start with, somewhat annoyed. He was about to speak again when a servant announced that an officer had arrived from the Prince of Zhongshun’s mansion to see him.\n\nJia Zheng, at a loss to understand why this messenger should come, since they had no dealings with that prince, told the servant to show the visitor quickly into the hall, and hurriedly changed his clothes. When he went out he found it was the chamberlain of the prince’s household. After an exchange of courtesies they took seats and the chamberlain was served with tea.\n\nWithout any preamble the chamberlain announced, “My business today, sir, is this. Our prince has sent me to request your help. Not only will he be most grateful, we his officers shall be eternally indebted to you too.”\n\n“Pray what is your business?” asked Jia Zheng, rising with a smile. “That I may know how to carry out your master’s wishes.”\n\nThe chamberlain smiled cynically. “No great matter. Just a word from you will suffice. We have an actor in our household called Qiguan who plays female roles. He’s always been well treated yet for some reason he’s disappeared during the last few days and, search as we may, we can find no trace of him. Enquiries show that he’s recently been on very good terms with your young son who wears the jade. So we assume he must be in your honourable mansion. Not like other families, yours is one to which we couldn’t apply directly. So I reported this to His Highness, who observed, ‘I could put up with the loss of any other actor, but not of this Qiguan. He’s so intelligent and well-behaved, he’s just the boy to cheer me up in my old age. I really can’t do without him.’ So I beg you to ask your worthy son to send Qiguan back. This will not only set the prince’s mind at rest but save us a great deal of trouble too.” With that he bowed.\n\nThis news enraged and at the same time alarmed Jia Zheng.\n\n“Send Baoyu here at once!” he ordered.\n\nBaoyu, who had no idea why he was wanted, hurried to the hall. His father asked him, “You scoundrel! How dare you kidnap an actor belonging to the prince?\n\nYou have been behaving in the most outrageous manner. That Qi-guan is in the service of His Highness the Prince of Zhong-shun. How dare a miserable little creature like you lure him from his duties and get me into trouble as well?’\n\nBao-yu was aghast.\n\n‘I know nothing about this, sir. I don’t even know what a “Qi-guan” is, let alone “luring him from his duties”.’\n\nHe began to cry.\n\nBefore Jia Zheng could say anything, the chamberlain gave a sarcastic laugh:\n\n‘You may as well own up, young gentleman. If you have him hidden away here, or if you know where he is, you had better tell us at once. It will save us a lot of trouble. We shall be most grateful to you.’\n\n‘I really know nothing about it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I think you must have been misinformed.’\n\nThe chamberlain smiled again.\n\n‘We have evidence, so there is not much point in denying it. Why not tell us now, in front of your father, and save yourself a lot of trouble? If you really know nothing, perhaps you would care to tell us how it is that you come to be wearing his red cummerbund?’\n\nBao-yu was stunned by this revelation. His jaw dropped and he stood gaping. He thought to himself: ‘How can he know about that? He must know all our other secrets too. I’d better tell them what they want to know, and avoid any further unpleasantness.’\n\n‘Since you know so much about him, sir,’ he said, ‘surely you must know about the house he has bought outside the city? I’ve heard that he has an estate somewhere in the eastern suburbs, about twenty miles from town, at a place called River-bend Creek. I should think he’s probably there now.’\n\nThe chamberlain smiled.\n\n‘In that case I am sure I shall find him there. I shall go and look. If I find him, well and good. If not, I shall have to come back and trouble you again.’\n\nHe made his farewells and hurried out.\n\nJia Zheng, who had watched this scene open-mouthed with horror, accompanied the chamberlain out. As he went, he turned and hissed at Bao-yu:\n\n‘Don’t you move! I shall have more to say to you when I get back!’\n\nHe was seeing the chamberlain to the gate when he caught sight of Jia Huan and a few pages running frantically in his direction. He shouted at the pages to stop, at which Jia Huan, seeing his father ahead of him and quaking with fright, came to a sudden halt and stood staring down at the ground.\n\n‘Why are you running?’ barked Jia Zheng. ‘And where are your tutors? How dare you rush about in this wild manner?’\n\nSeeing his father’s extreme displeasure, Jia Huan seized his opportunity.\n\n‘I wasn’t running,’ he said. ‘It was just that as I was walking past the well, I saw someone who had fallen in and drowned – a maid, it was. She had such a horrible great swollen head and her body was all puffed up. It was so terrifying, I thought I’d better run and tell someone as quickly as I could.’\n\nJia Zheng looked amazed and incredulous.\n\n‘How could anyone from this household fall into a well and get drowned? We have always been most humane in our treatment of inferiors. This is most out of character. I fear that in recent years I have been far too lax in the running of this establishment, with the result that the senior members of the staff have been able to abuse their authority and tyrannize their underlings. This must be an example of their handiwork. It could bring great disgrace upon our name. We should never be able to hold up our heads again if it became known outside.’\n\nHe shouted to the pages:\n\n‘Fetch Jia Lian and Lai Da!’\n\nJia Huan hurried forward and, falling to his knees, caught hold of his father’s coat.\n\n‘Don’t be angry, Father! Except for the people in Lady Wang’s apartment, no one else knows about this. I heard my mother say...’\n\nHe broke off and looked around him. Jia Zheng understood and motioned with his eyes to the pages to withdraw. When they had gone, Jia Huan whispered:\n\n‘My mother told me that the other day Bao-yu tried to rape Jin-chuan in Mother’s room, and when she resisted, he beat her, and then in a fit of anger she drowned herself.’\n\nJia Zheng turned livid with rage.\n\n‘Fetch Bao-yu!’ he roared, and strode furiously into the study.\n\nHe stormed off to his study and roared, “If anyone tries to dissuade me today, I shall hand over to them my official insignia and the family property to share with Baoyu, while I become a criminal and shave off these few remaining troublesome hairs to find some clean spot to end my life. At least I shan’t have lived to disgrace my ancestors and beget a monster of a son!”\n\nHis secretaries and pages, knowing that he was in this state again on account of Baoyu, bit their fingers and stuck out their tongues in dismay as they hastily withdrew.\n\nPanting hard, Jia Zheng slumped stiffly in his chair, his face wet with tears. He stormed on without a stop:\n\n“Bring Baoyu here! Bring a heavy rod and rope! Lock the gates! If anyone sends word to the inner apartments, they’ll be beaten to death!”\n\nThe pages had to assent. Some of them went to fetch Baoyu.\n\nBaoyu, on hearing his father order him to wait, had guessed that things were in a bad way; but he had no idea that Jia Huan had added fuel to the flames. Pacing up and down in the hall, he was wondering how to get a message through when no one came — even Beiming had disappeared. As he was hoping against hope, an old nanny finally appeared. He pounced on her like a treasure-trove.\n\n“Go quick and tell them the master’s going to beat me,” he urged. “Quick, quick! It’s urgent!”\n\nIn his agitation he spoke incoherently and the old woman, being deaf, did not catch what he said. She simply heard the word “urgent.”\n\n“What’s so urgent?” she asked. “He’s already jumped into the well. Let him jump. What does it matter to you, young master?”\n\nWhen Baoyu saw she was deaf, he cried in desperation, “Go and get my page, will you?”\n\n“You’ve nothing to worry about,” she assured him. “It’s all over. The mistress has rewarded them with silver and it’s all settled.”\n\nBaoyu stamped in despair. And just then Jia Zheng’s pages arrived and forced him to go with them. The sight of him made Jia Zheng see red. Without waiting to inquire about his association with actors, his gift to one of them, his neglect of studies or his attempt to rape his mother’s maid, he bellowed:\n\n“Gag him! Beat him to death!”\n\nNot daring to disobey, some of the pages pressed Baoyu down on a bench, while others raised the heavy rod and brought it down on him a dozen times or so. Knowing that no pleading would avail, Baoyu simply howled. His father, considering this too lenient, kicked aside the page with the rod and seizing it himself rained blows with all his might. Never in all his born days had Baoyu been beaten like this. At first he had yelled and cried, but soon his cries grew fainter until he could no longer even sob.\n\nHis secretaries, alarmed by the severity of the beating, now came forward to plead for him; but Jia Zheng would not listen.\n\n“Ask him what he’s done!” he fumed. “You can’t excuse such behaviour. It’s you people who’ve always spoilt him and got him into this state, and now you come to intercede. Do you want me to wait till he does away with his father or his sovereign before you stop interfering?”\n\nAt this they hastily withdrew and sent to the inner apartments for help.\n\nWhen Lady Wang heard the news she did not wait to inform the Lady Dowager but hurried out, attended by a maid, regardless of the proprieties. The secretaries and pages scattered at her approach.\n\nJia Zheng’s rage had been fanned to fresh fury by her arrival, and the rod came down faster and harder. When the servants holding Baoyu saw Lady Wang enter, they loosened their grip and withdrew, leaving the boy who had long since ceased to move. But as Jia Zheng raised the rod again, his wife caught hold of it.\n\n“Enough, enough!” she cried. “You’ll kill him.”\n\n“You’re trying to provoke me,” he stormed. “Today I’m set on killing him. We can’t have such a monster in the family.”\n\n“Baoyu deserves a beating,” sobbed Lady Wang. “But you mustn’t wear yourself out, sir. Besides, it’s a hot day and the old lady isn’t well. Killing Baoyu is a small matter, but should anything happen to the old lady that would be serious.”\n\n“Don’t talk to me like that!” he fumed. “I’ve bred this degenerate who has failed in his filial duty. I’ve been remiss in my duty too. When I try to discipline him, everyone shields him. The best thing would be to put an end to him now to avoid future trouble.” He called for a rope to strangle the boy.\n\nLady Wang flung her arms around Baoyu. “You’re right to discipline your son, of course,” she sobbed, “but you should have some consideration for your wife. I’m fifty and this wretch is my only son. If you insist on making an example of him, I dare not protest too strongly. But if you mean to kill him today, it’s clear you want to be the death of me. Better strangle me first, then do what you like with him. We mother and son can die together and that will be some comfort to us in the nether regions.” With that she threw herself on Baoyu and burst out sobbing.\n\nJia Zheng heaved a long sigh and sat down on a chair, his own cheeks wet with tears.\n\nLady Wang, holding Baoyu, saw that his face was waxen, his breathing faint, and his thin green silk trousers were stained with blood. She could not stop herself from unfastening his girdle. From his thighs to his calves there was not an inch unbruised, not a patch unbroken. The sight made her cry:\n\n“You’re fated to die, my son!”\n\nThis reminded her of her first son Zhu, and she called out to him, wailing, “If only you were still alive, I wouldn’t care if a hundred children died.”\n\nNow Lady Wang’s emergence from the study had brought Li Wan, Xifeng and the Jia girls on the scene. Lady Wang’s cry of “Zhu!” made Li Wan break down completely, while Jia Zheng’s tears fell faster than ever.\n\nIn the midst of this pandemonium they heard a maid announce, “The old lady is coming!”\n\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when a quivering voice was heard in the courtyard: “Kill me first, then put my grandson to death, and we’ll be quit of each other!”\n\nJia Zheng rose hurriedly to meet his mother, dismayed as well as distraught. The Lady Dowager was leaning on her maid’s arm as she entered, shaking with anger and out of breath.\n\nHe bowed and forcing a smile said, “What brings you out in this heat, madam? If you had any instructions, you should have sent for me.”\n\nThe old lady halted to catch her breath. “What instructions have I for you?” she retorted sternly. “The only trouble is, I’ve borne an unworthy son. Whom am I to complain to?”\n\nThis made Jia Zheng fall on his knees. “I only disciplined the boy for the honour of our ancestors,” he said with tears. “How can I bear such reproaches from you, madam?”\n\nShe spat in disgust. “A word of complaint is too much for you, is it? But those murderous cudgels were good enough for Baoyu. You say you’re disciplining your son for the honour of your ancestors. Well, how did your father discipline you?” She was sobbing now herself.\n\n“Don’t upset yourself, madam.” Jia Zheng managed a smile. “I was too hasty. I promise not to beat him again.”\n\nThe old lady snorted. “Don’t try to smooth things over. I suppose you’re tired of us all. We’d better leave you, then we shan’t be in your way.” She ordered the servants, “Prepare a sedan-chair! I’m taking your mistress and Baoyu back to Nanking.”\n\nThe servants had to assenting, and the old lady turned to Lady Wang.\n\n“Don’t cry,” she said. “You dote on Baoyu now that he’s young; but when he grows up and becomes a high official, he may very well forget that you’re his mother. Better not be so fond of him if you want to spare yourself heartache in future.”\n\nJia Zheng kowtowed. “Don’t say that,” he begged. “I shall never be able to atone for my fault.”\n\n\"If that’s how you feel, madam, your son has no place to stand here any more.\"\n\n\"You’re the one who’s leaving me no place to stand, yet you talk that way!\" retorted the Lady Dowager. \"We’re simply going back so that you can do as you please, with no one to stop you beating him.\" She ordered the servants to get her carriage ready at once.\n\nChia Cheng straightened up and knelt down to kotow in apology.\n\nAs she stormed, the old lady had been looking at Pao-yu. This flogging had been more severe than any before. His lower garments were stained with blood and there was not an inch of his skin from his thighs to his calves that was not black and blue. For rage as well as distress she threw her arms around him and wept. Not until Lady Wang and Hsi-feng had pleaded with her for some time did she slowly calm down. Some maids and serving-women tried to help Pao-yu up, but Hsi-feng swore at them:\n\n\"Stupid fools! Can’t you use your eyes? In this state how can he walk? Go and fetch that rattan summer couch at once to carry him on.\"\n\nThey hastily ran to fetch it.\n\nThey laid Pao-yu on the couch and carried him to the Lady Dowager’s apartment, escorted by the old lady and Lady Wang. Chia Cheng, seeing that his mother was still in a rage, had not dared to leave but was following behind. And when he saw what a bad state Pao-yu was in and heard Lady Wang crying:\n\n\"Now that you’ve killed him, what use is Chu? But if you had Chu, at least your father wouldn’t be so angry and I wouldn’t have slaved all these years for nothing. If anything happens to you now, what shall I do?\" And when she went on sobbing, \"You undutiful son,\" he felt remorse for having beaten the boy so savagely. He turned to console his mother, who had tears in her eyes.\n\n\"If a son is no good he should be disciplined, but you shouldn’t have gone so far,\" she told him. \"Why are you still here? Don’t tell me the sight of him isn’t enough for you — you won’t be satisfied until you’ve seen him die?\"\n\nThen Chia Cheng withdrew with a respectful murmur.\n\nBy now Aunt Hsueh, Pao-chai, Hsiang-ling, Hsi-jen and Hsiang-yun had arrived. Hsi-jen, though consumed with anxiety, could not show it. And as the others were all busy around Pao-yu, fetching water or fanning him, with no place for her, she slipped out to the second gate and sent pages to find Pei-ming and bring him to her.\n\n\"Why did the master beat him so suddenly?\" she demanded. \"Why didn’t you let us know beforehand?\"\n\n\"I wasn’t with him,\" said Pei-ming frantically. \"I only heard about it halfway through the beating. When I asked the reason, I was told it was because of Master Chiang and because of Chin-chuan’s suicide.\"\n\n\"How did the master come to know about those things?\"\n\n\"Most likely young Master Hsueh was jealous of Master Chiang and worked off his spite by setting someone else on to tell the master. As for Chin-chuan, that was probably Master Huan who let it out. I heard that from one of the master’s attendants.\"\n\nSince this tallied with her own suspicions, Hsi-jen believed it. She went back to find the others attending to Pao-yu. When they had finished, the Lady Dowager ordered him to be carried carefully to his own room. They assented and carried him, with a great to-do, to Happy Red Court, where they laid him on his own bed. By the time the confusion had subsided and the others left, Hsi-jen went in to tend him carefully and ask how he felt.\n\nBut more of this in the next chapter."
