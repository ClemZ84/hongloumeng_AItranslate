  "original": "话说尤三姐自尽之后，尤老娘合二姐儿、贾珍、贾琏等俱不胜悲恸，自不必说，忙命盛殓，送往城外埋葬。柳湘莲见三姐身亡，痴情眷恋，却被道人数句冷言，打破迷关，竟自截发出家，跟随这疯道人飘然而去，不知何往。暂且不表。\n　　且说薛姨妈闻知湘莲已说定了尤三姐为妻，心中甚喜，正是高高兴兴，要打算替他买房子，治家伙，择吉迎娶，以报他救命之恩。忽有家中小厮吵嚷：“三姐儿自尽了。”被小丫头们听见，告知薛姨妈。薛姨妈不知为何，心甚叹息。正在猜疑，宝钗从园里过来，薛姨妈便对宝钗说道：“我的儿，你听见了没有？你珍大嫂子的妹妹三姑娘，他不是已经许定给你哥哥的义弟柳湘莲了么？不知为什么自刎了，那湘莲也不知往那里去了。真正奇怪的事，叫人意想不到的。”宝钗听了并不在意，便说道：“俗语说的好：‘天有不测风云，人有旦夕祸福。’这也是他们前生命定。前儿妈妈为他救了哥哥，商量着替他料理，如今已经死的死了，走的走了，依我说也只好由他罢了，妈妈也不必为他们伤感了。倒是自从哥哥打江南回来了一二十日，贩了来的货物想来也该发完了。那同伴去的伙计们辛辛苦苦的回来几个月了，妈妈合哥哥商议商议，也该请一请，酬谢酬谢才是。别叫人家看着无理似的。”\n　　母女正说话间，见薛蟠自外而入，眼中尚有泪痕。一进门来，便向母亲拍手说道：“妈妈可知道柳二哥、尤三姐的事么？”薛姨妈说：“我才听见说，正在这里合你妹妹说这件公案呢。”薛蟠道：“妈妈可听见说湘莲跟着一个道士出了家了么？”薛姨妈道：“这越发奇了。怎么柳相公那样一个年轻的聪明人，一时糊涂了就跟着道士去了呢？我想你们好了一场，他又无父母兄弟，单身一人在此，你该各处找找他才是。靠那道士，能往那里远去？左不过是在这方近左右的庙里寺里罢了。”薛蟠说：“何尝不是呢。我一听见这个信儿，就连忙带了小厮们在各处寻找。连一个影儿也没有。又去问人，都说没看见。”薛姨妈说：“你既找寻过，没有，也算把你做朋友的心尽了。焉知他这一出家，不是得了好处去呢？只是你如今也该张罗张罗买卖，二则把你自己娶媳妇应办的事情，倒早些料理料理。咱们家没人，俗语说的，‘夯雀儿先飞，’省的临时丢三落四的不齐全，令人笑话。再者，你妹妹才说你也回家半个多月了，想货物也该发完了，同你去的伙计们，也该摆桌酒给他们道道乏才是。人家陪着你走了二三千里的路程，受了四五个月的辛苦，而且在路上又替你担了多少的惊怕沉重。”薛蟠听说，便道：“妈妈说的很是。倒是妹妹想的周到。我也这样想着。只因这些日子，为各处发货，闹的脑袋都大了，又为柳二哥的事忙了这几日，反倒落了一个空，白张罗了一会子，倒把正经事都误了。要不然，定了明儿后儿，下帖儿请罢。”薛姨妈道：“由你办去罢。”\n　　话犹未了，外面小厮进来回说：“管总的张大爷差人送了两箱子东西来，说：‘这是爷各自买的，不在货账里面。本要早送来，因货物箱子压着，没得拿；昨儿货物发完了，所以今日才送来了。’”一面说，一面又见两个小厮搬进了两个夹板夹的大棕箱。薛蟠一见，说：“嗳哟，可是我怎么就糊涂到这步田地了。特特的给妈合妹妹带来的东西，都忘了，没拿了家里来，还是伙计送了来了。”宝钗说：“亏你说还是‘特特的带来’的，才放了一二十天。要不是‘特特的带来’，大约要放到年底下才送来呢。我看你也诸事太不留心了。”薛蟠笑道：“想是在路上叫人把魂打掉了，还没归窍呢。”说着，大家笑了一回，便向小丫头说：“出去告诉小厮们，东西收下，叫他们回去罢。”薛姨妈和宝钗因问：“到底是什么东西，这样捆着绑着的？”薛蟠便命叫两个小厮进来，解了绳子，去了夹板，开了锁看时，这一箱都是绸缎绫锦洋货等家常应用之物。薛蟠笑着道：“那一箱是给妹妹带的。”亲自来开。母女二人看时，却是些笔、墨、纸、砚，各色笺纸、香袋、香珠、扇子、扇坠、花粉、胭脂等物。外有虎丘带来的自行人，酒令儿，水银灌的打金斗小小子，沙子灯，一出一出的泥人儿的戏用青纱罩的匣子装着。又有在虎丘山上泥捏的薛蟠的小像，与薛蟠毫无相差。宝钗见了别的都不理论，倒是薛蟠的小像，拿着细细看了一看，又看看他哥哥，不禁笑起来了。因叫莺儿带着几个老婆子，将这些东西连箱子送到园子里去。又和母亲哥哥说了一回闲话，才回园子里去。这里薛姨妈将箱子里的东西取出，一分一分的打点清楚，叫同喜送给贾母并王夫人等处，不提。\n　　且说宝钗到了自己房中，将那些玩意一件一件的过了目，除了自己留用之外，一分一分配合妥当：也有送笔、墨、纸、砚的，也有送香袋、扇子、香坠的，也有送脂粉、头油的，有单送玩意儿的。只有黛玉的比别人不同，且又加厚一倍。一一打点完毕，使莺儿同着一个老婆子，跟着送往各处。这边姐妹诸人都收了东西，赏赐来使，说：“见面再谢。”惟有黛玉看见他家乡之物，反自触物伤情，想起：“父母双亡，又无兄弟，寄居亲戚家中，那里有人也给我带些土物来？”想到这里，不觉的又伤起心来了。紫鹃深知黛玉心肠，但也不敢说破，只在一旁劝道：“姑娘的身子多病，早晚服药，这两日看着比那些日子略好些，虽说精神长了一点儿，还算不得十分大好。今儿宝姑娘送来的这些东西，可见宝姑娘素日看着姑娘很重，姑娘看着该喜欢才是，为什么反倒伤起心来？这不是宝姑娘送东西来，倒叫姑娘烦恼了不成？就是宝姑娘听见，反觉脸上不好看。再者，这里老太太们为姑娘的病体，千方百计请好大夫配药诊治，也为是姑娘的病好。这如今才好些，又这样哭哭啼啼，岂不是自己遭塌了自己身子，叫老太太看着添了愁烦了么？况且姑娘这病，原是素日忧虑过度，伤了血气。姑娘的千金贵体，也别自己看轻了。”\n　　紫鹃正在这里劝解，只听见小丫头子在院内说：“宝二爷来了。”紫鹃忙说：“请二爷进来罢。”只见宝玉进房来。黛玉让坐毕，宝玉见黛玉泪痕满面，便问：“妹妹，又是谁气着你了？”黛玉勉强笑道：“谁生什么气。”旁边紫鹃将嘴向床后桌上一努。宝玉会意，往那里一瞧，见堆着许多东西，就知道是宝钗送来的，便取笑说道：“那里这些东西？不是妹妹要开杂货铺啊？”黛玉也不答言。紫鹃笑着道：“二爷还提东西呢。因宝姑娘送了些东西来，姑娘一看，就伤起心来了。我正在这里劝解，恰好二爷来的很巧，替我们劝劝。”宝玉明知黛玉是这个原故，却也不敢提头儿，只得笑说道：“你们姑娘的原故，想来不为别的，必是宝姑娘送来的东西少，所以生气伤心。妹妹你放心，等我明年叫人往江南去，给你多多的带两船来，省得你淌眼抹泪的。”黛玉听了这些话，也知宝玉是为自己开心，也不好推，也不好任，因说道：“我任凭怎么没见过世面，也到不了这步田地，因送的东西少就生气伤心。我又不是两三岁的孩子，你也忒把人看得小气了。我有我的原故，你那里知道？”说着，眼泪又流下来了。\n　　宝玉忙走到床前挨着黛玉坐下，将那些东西一件一件拿起来，摆弄着细瞧，故意问：“这是什么，叫什么名字？”“那是什么做的，这样齐整？”“这是什么，要他做什么使用？”又说：“这一件可以摆在面前。”又说：“那一件可以放在条桌上，当古董儿倒好呢。”一味的将些没要紧的话来厮混。黛玉见宝玉如此，自己心里倒过不去，便说：“你不用在这里混搅了，咱们到宝姐姐那边去罢。”宝玉巴不的黛玉出去散散闷解了悲痛，便道：“宝姐姐送咱们东西，咱们原该谢谢去。”黛玉道：“自家姐妹，这倒不必。只是到他那边，薛大哥回来了，必然告诉他些南边的古迹儿，我去听听，只当回了家乡一趟的。”说着眼圈儿又红了。宝玉便站着等他。黛玉只得和他出来，往宝钗那里去了。\n　　且说薛蟠听了母亲之言，急下了请帖，办了酒席。次日，请了四位伙计，俱已到齐，不免说些贩卖账目发货之事。不一时，上席让坐，薛蟠挨次斟了酒，薛姨妈又使人出来致意。大家喝着酒说闲话儿，内中一个道：“今儿这席上短两个好朋友。”众人齐问：“是谁？”那人道：“还有谁，就是贾府上的琏二爷和大爷的盟弟柳二爷。”大家果然都想起来，问着薛蟠道：“怎么不请琏二爷合柳二爷来？”薛蟠闻言，把眉一皱，叹口气道：“琏二爷又往平安州去了，头两天就起了身了。那柳二爷竟别提起，真是天下头一件奇事。什么是‘柳二爷’，如今不知那里作‘柳道爷’去了。”众人都诧异道：“这是怎么说？”薛蟠便把湘莲前后事体说了一遍。众人听了，越发骇异，因说道：“怪不的前儿我们在店里，仿仿佛佛也听见人吵嚷说：‘有一个道士，三言两语，把一个人度了去了。’又说“‘一阵风刮了去了。’只不知是谁。我们正发货，那里有闲工夫打听这个事去？到如今还是似信不信的，谁知就是柳二爷呢。早知是他，我们大家也该劝劝他才是。任他怎么着，也不叫他去。”内中一个道：“别是这么着罢？”众人问：“怎么样？”那人道：“柳二爷那样个伶俐人，未必是真跟了道士去罢？他原会些武艺，又有力量，或看破那道士的妖术邪法，特意跟他去，在背地摆布他，也未可知。”薛蟠道：“果然如此，倒也罢了。世上这些妖言惑众的人，怎么没人治他一下子！”众人道：“那时难道你知道了也没找寻他去？”薛蟠说：“城里城外，那里没有找到？不怕你们笑话，我找不着他，还哭了一场呢。”言毕，只是长吁短叹，无精打彩的，不象往日高兴。众伙计见他这样光景，自然不便久坐，不过随便喝了几杯酒，吃了饭，大家散了。\n　　且说宝玉和着黛玉到宝钗处来，宝玉见了宝钗，便说道：“大哥哥辛辛苦苦的带了东西来，姐姐留着使罢，又送我们。”宝钗笑道：“原不是什么好东西，不过是远路带来的土物儿，大家看着新鲜些就是了。”黛玉道：“这些东西，我们小时候倒不理会，如今看见，真是新鲜物儿了。”宝钗因笑道：“妹妹知道，这就是俗语说的‘物离乡贵’，其实可算什么呢！”宝玉听了这话，正对了黛玉方才的心事，连忙拿话岔道：“明年好歹大哥哥再去时，替我们多带些来。”黛玉瞅了他一眼，便道：“你要你只管说，不必拉扯上人。姐姐你瞧，宝哥哥不是给姐姐来道谢，竟又要定下明年的东西来了。”说的宝钗、宝玉都笑了。\n　　三个人又闲话了一回，因提起黛玉的病来，宝钗劝了一回，因说道：“妹妹若觉着身上不爽快，倒要自己勉强扎挣着出来，各处走走逛逛，散散心，比在屋里闷坐着到底好些。我那两日，不是觉着发懒，浑身发热，只是要歪着？也因为时气不好，怕病，因此寻些事情，自己混着，这两日才觉得好些了。”黛玉道：“姐姐说的何尝不是？我也是这么想着呢。”大家又坐了一会子方散。宝玉仍把黛玉送至潇湘馆门首，才各自回去了。\n　　且说赵姨娘，因见宝钗送了贾环些东西，心中甚是喜欢。想道：“怨不得别人都说那宝丫头好，会做人，很大方。如今看起来果然不错。他哥哥能带了多少东西来？他挨门儿送到，并不遗漏一处，也不露出谁薄谁厚。连我们这样没时运的，他都想到了。要是那林丫头，他把我们娘儿们正眼也不瞧，那里还肯送我们东西？”一面想，一面把那些东西翻来复去的摆弄，瞧看一回。忽然想到宝钗系王夫人的亲戚，为何不到王夫人跟前卖个好儿呢？自己便蝎蝎螫螫的，拿着东西，走至王夫人房中，站在旁边，陪笑说道：“这是宝姑娘才刚给环哥儿的。难为宝姑娘这么年轻的人，想的这么周到，真是大户人家的姑娘，又展样，又大方，怎么叫人不敬奉呢。怪不的老太太和太太成日家都夸他疼他。我也不敢自专就收起来，特拿来给太太瞧瞧，太太也喜欢喜欢。”王夫人听了，早知道来意了。又见他说的不伦不类，也不便不理他，说道：“你只管收了去给环哥玩罢。”赵姨娘来时兴兴头头，谁知抹了一鼻子灰，满心生气，又不敢露出来，只得讪讪的出来了。到了自己房中，将东西丢在一边，嘴里咕咕哝哝，自言自语道：“这个又算了个什么儿呢！”一面坐着各自生了一回闷气。\n　　却说莺儿带着老婆子们送东西回来，回复了宝钗，将众人道谢的话并赏赐的银钱都回完了，那老婆子便出去了。莺儿走近前来一步，挨着宝钗，悄悄的说道：“刚才我到琏二奶奶那边，看见二奶奶一脸的怒气。我送下东西出来时，悄悄的问小红，说：‘刚才二奶奶从老太太屋里回来，不似往日欢天喜地的，叫了平儿去，唧唧咕咕的不知说了些什么。’看那个光景，倒象有什么大事的似的。姑娘没听见那边老太太有什么事？”宝钗听了，也自己纳闷，想不出凤姐是为什么有气。便道：“各人家有各人的事，咱们那里管得？你去倒茶去来。”莺儿于是出来，自己倒茶不提。\n　　且说宝玉送了黛玉回来，想着黛玉的孤苦，不免也替他伤感起来，因要将这话告诉袭人。进来时，却只有麝月、秋纹在屋里，因问：“你袭人姐姐那里去了？”麝月道：“左不过在这几个院里，那里就丢了他？一时不见就这样找。”宝玉笑着道：“不是怕丢了他。因我方才到林姑娘那边，见林姑娘又正伤心呢。问起来，却是为宝姐姐送了他东西，他看见是他家乡的土物，不免对景伤情。我要告诉你袭人姐姐，叫他过去劝劝。”正说着，晴雯进来了，因问宝玉道：“你回来了，你又要叫劝谁？”宝玉将方才的话说了一遍。晴雯道：“袭人姐姐才出去。听见他说要到琏二奶奶那边去。保不住还到林姑娘那里去呢。”宝玉听了，便不言语。秋纹倒了茶来，宝玉漱了一口，递给小丫头子，心中着实不自在，就随便歪在床上。\n　　却说袭人因宝玉出门，自己作了回活计。忽想起凤姐身上不好，这几天也没有过去看看，况闻贾琏出门，正好大家说说话儿，便告诉晴雯：“好生在屋里，别都出去了，叫二爷回来抓不着人。”晴雯道：“嗳哟！这屋里单你一个人惦记着他，我们都是白闲着混饭吃的。”袭人笑着，也不答言，就走了。刚来到沁芳桥畔，那里正是夏末秋初，池中莲藕新残相间，红绿离披。袭人走着，沿堤看玩了一回，猛抬头，看见那边葡萄架底下，有人拿着掸子在那里掸什么呢。走到跟前，却是老祝妈。那老婆子见了袭人，便笑嘻嘻的迎上来，说道：“姑娘怎么今儿得工夫出来逛逛？”袭人道：“可不是吗，我要到琏二奶奶那里瞧瞧去。你这里做什么呢？”那婆子道：“我在这里赶蜜蜂儿。今年三伏里雨水少，这果子树上都有虫子，把果子吃的疤癞流星的，掉了好些了。姑娘还不知道呢，这马蜂最可恶的，一嘟噜上只咬破两三个儿，那破的水滴到好的上头，连这一嘟噜都是要烂的。姑娘你瞧咱们说话的空儿没赶，就落上许多了。”袭人道：“你就是不住手的赶，也赶不了多少。你倒是告诉买办，叫他多多做些小冷布口袋儿，一嘟噜套上一个，又透风，又不遭塌。”婆子笑道：“倒是姑娘说的是。我今年才管上，那里知道这个巧法儿呢？”因又笑着说道：“今年果子虽遭塌了些，味儿倒好，不信摘一个姑娘尝尝。”袭人正色道：“这那里使得。不但没熟吃不得，就是熟了，上头还没有供鲜，咱们倒先吃了，你是府里使老了的，难道连这个规矩都不懂了？”老祝妈忙笑道：“姑娘说的是。我见姑娘很喜欢，我才敢这么说，可就把规矩错了。我可是老糊涂了。”袭人道：“这也没有什么，只是你们有年纪的老奶奶们，别先领着头儿这么着就好了。”\n　　说着，遂一径出了园门，来到凤姐这边。一到院里，只听凤姐说道：“天理良心，我在这屋里熬的越发成了贼了！”袭人听见这话，知道有原故了，又不好回来，又不好进去，遂把脚步放重些，隔着窗子问道：“平姐姐在家里呢么？”平儿忙答应着迎出来。袭人便问：“二奶奶也在家里呢么？身上可大安了？”说着，已走进来。凤姐装着在床上歪着呢，见袭人进来，也笑着站起来，说：“好些了，叫你惦着。怎么这几日不过我们这边坐坐？”袭人道：“奶奶身上欠安，本该天天过来请安才是。但只怕奶奶身上不爽快，倒要静静儿的歇歇儿，我们来了，倒吵的奶奶烦。”凤姐笑道：“烦是没的话。倒是宝兄弟屋里虽然人多，也就靠着你一个照看他，也实在的离不开。我常听见平儿告诉我说，你背地里还惦着我，常常问我。这就是你尽心了。”一面说着，叫平儿挪了张杌子放在床旁边，让袭人坐下。丰儿端进茶来。袭人欠身道：“妹妹坐着罢。”\n　　一面说闲话儿。只见一个小丫头子在外间屋里，悄悄的和平儿说：“旺儿来了，在二门上伺候着呢。”又听见平儿也悄俏的道：“知道了。叫他先去，回来再来。别在门口儿站着。”袭人知他们有事，又说了两句话，便起身要走。凤姐道：“闲来坐坐，说说话儿，我倒开心。”因命：“平儿，送送你妹妹。”平儿答应着，送出来。只见两三个小丫头子都在那里，屏声息气，齐齐的伺候着。袭人不知何事，便自去了。\n　　却说平儿送出袭人，进来回道：“旺儿才来了，因袭人在这里，我叫他先到外头等等儿。这会子还是立刻叫他呢，还是等着？请奶奶的示下。”凤姐道：“叫他来！”平儿忙叫小丫头去传旺儿进来。这里凤姐又问平儿：“你到底是怎么听见说的？”平儿道：“就是头里那个丫头子的话。他说他在二门里头，听见外头两个小厮说：‘这个新二奶奶比咱们旧二奶奶还俊呢，脾气儿也好。’不知是旺儿是谁，吆喝了两个一顿，说：‘什么新奶奶旧奶奶的，还不快悄悄儿的呢！叫里头知道了，把你的舌头还割了呢。’”平儿正说着，只见一个小丫头进来，回说：“旺儿在外头伺候着呢。”凤姐听了，冷笑了一声，说：“叫他进来！”那小丫头出来说：“奶奶叫呢。”旺儿连忙答应着进来。\n　　旺儿请了安，在外间门口垂手侍立。凤姐儿道：“你过来！我问你话。”旺儿才走到里间门旁站着。凤姐儿道：“你二爷在外头弄了人，你知道不知道？”旺儿又打着千儿，回道：“奴才天天在二门上听差事，如何能知道二爷外头的事呢？”凤姐冷笑道：“你自然‘不知道’！你要知道，你怎么拦人呢！”旺儿见这话，知道刚才的话已经走了风了，料着瞒不过，便又跪回道：“奴才实在不知，就是头里兴儿和喜儿两个人在那里混说，奴才吆喝了他们两句。内中深情底里，奴才不知道，不敢妄回，求奶奶问兴儿，他是长跟二爷出门的。”凤姐儿听了，下死劲啐了一口，骂道：“你们这一起没良心的混账忘八崽子，都是一条藤儿！打量我不知道呢。先去给我把兴儿那个忘八崽子叫了来，你也不许走！问明白了他，回来再问你。好，好，好，这才是我使出来的好人呢！”那旺儿只得连声答应几个“是”，磕了个头，爬起来出去，去叫兴儿。\n　　却说兴儿正在账房儿里和小厮们玩呢，听见说“二奶奶叫”，先唬了一跳。却也想不到是这件事发作了，连忙跟着旺儿进来。旺儿先进去，回说：“兴儿来了。”凤姐儿厉声道：“叫他！”那兴儿听见这个声音儿，早已没了主意了，只得乍着胆子进来。凤姐儿一见便说：“好小子啊，你和你爷办的好事啊。你只实说罢！”兴儿一闻此言，又看见凤姐儿气色，及两边丫头们的光景，早唬软了，不觉跪下，只是磕头。凤姐儿道：“论起这事来，我也听见说不与你相干，但只你不早来回我知道，这就是你的不是了。你要实说了，我还饶你！再有一句虚言，你先摸摸你腔子上几个脑袋瓜子！”兴儿战兢兢的朝上磕头道：“奶奶问的是什么事，奴才和爷办坏了？”凤姐听了，一腔火都发作起来，喝命：“打嘴巴！”旺儿过来才要打时，凤姐儿骂道：“什么糊涂忘八崽子！叫他自己打，用你打吗？一会子你再各人打你的嘴巴子还不迟呢。”那兴儿真个自己左右开弓，打了自己十几个嘴巴。凤姐儿喝声“站住”，问道：“你二爷外头娶了什么‘新奶奶’‘旧奶奶’的事，你大概不知道啊？”兴儿见说出这件事来，越发着了慌，连忙把帽子抓下来，在砖地上咕咚咕咚碰的头山响，口里说道：“只求奶奶超生！奴才再不敢撒一个字儿的谎。”凤姐道：“快说！”\n　　兴儿直蹶蹶的跪起来回道：“这事头里奴才也不知道。就是这一天东府里大老爷送了殡，俞禄往珍大爷庙里，去领银子，二爷同着蓉哥儿到了东府里，道儿上，爷儿两个说起珍大奶奶那边的二位姨奶奶来，二爷夸他好，蓉哥儿哄着二爷，说把二姨奶奶说给二爷。”凤姐听到这里，使劲啐道：“呸！没脸的忘八蛋！他是你那一门子的姨奶奶？”兴儿忙又磕头说：“奴才该死。”往上瞅着，不敢言语。凤姐儿道：“完了吗？怎么不说了？”兴儿方才又回道：“奶奶恕奴才，奴才才敢回。”凤姐啐道：“放你妈的屁！这还什么‘恕’不‘恕’了。你好生给我往下说，好多着呢！”兴儿又回道：“二爷听见这个话，就喜欢了。后来奴才也不知道怎么就弄真了。”凤姐微微冷笑道：“这个自然么，你可那里知道呢？你知道的，只怕都烦了呢！是了，说底下的罢。”兴儿回道：“后来就是蓉哥儿给二爷找了房子。”凤姐忙问道：“如今房子在那里？”兴儿道：“就在府后头。”凤姐儿道：“哦！”回头瞅着平儿，道：“咱们都是死人哪，你听听！”平儿也不敢作声。\n　　兴儿又回道：“珍大爷那边给了张家不知多少银子，那张家就不问了。”凤姐道：“这里头怎么又扯拉上什么张家李家呢？”兴儿回道：“奶奶不知道。这二奶奶，”刚说到这里，又自己打了个嘴巴，把凤姐儿倒怄笑了，两边的丫头也都抿嘴儿笑。兴儿想了想，说道：“那珍大奶奶的妹子，”凤姐儿接着道：“怎么样？快说呀！”兴儿道：“那珍大奶奶的妹子原来从小儿有人家的，姓张，叫什么张华，如今穷的待好讨饭。珍大爷许了他银子，他就退了亲了。”凤姐儿听到这里，点了点头儿，回头便望丫头们说道：“你们都听见了？小忘八崽子，头里他还说他不知道呢。”兴儿又道：“后来二爷才叫人裱糊了房子，娶过来了。”凤姐道：“打那里娶过来的？”兴儿回道：“就在他老娘家抬过来的。”凤姐道：“好罢咧！”又问：“没人送亲么？”兴儿道：“就是蓉哥儿，还有几个丫头老婆子们，没别人。”凤姐道：“你大奶奶没来吗？”兴儿道：“过了两天，大奶奶才拿了些东西来瞧的。”凤姐儿笑了一笑，回头向平儿道：“怪道那两天二爷称赞大奶奶不离嘴呢。”掉过脸来，又问兴儿：“谁伏侍呢？自然是你了？”兴儿赶着碰头，不言语。凤姐又问：“前头那些日子，说给那府里办事，想来办的就是这个了？”兴儿回道：“也有办事的时候，也有往新房子里去的时候。”凤姐又问道：“谁和他住着呢？”兴儿道：“他母亲和他妹子。昨儿他妹子自己抹了脖子了。”凤姐道：“这又为什么？”兴儿随将柳湘莲的事说了一遍。凤姐道：“这个人还算造化高，省了当那出名儿的忘八。”因又问道：“没了别的事了么？”兴儿道：“别的事奴才不知道。奴才刚才说的，字字是实话。一字虚假，奶奶问出来，只管打死奴才，奴才也无怨的。”\n　　凤姐低了一回头，便又指着兴儿说道：“你这个猴儿崽子，就该打死！这有什么瞒着我的？你想着瞒了我，就在你那糊涂爷跟前讨了好儿了，你新奶奶好疼你。我不看你刚才还有点怕惧儿不敢撤谎，我把你的腿不给你砸折了呢！”说着，喝声起去，兴儿磕了个头，才爬起来，退到外间门口不敢就走。凤姐道：“过来！我还有话呢。”兴儿赶忙垂手敬听。凤姐道：“你忙什么？新奶奶等着赏你什么呢？”兴儿也不敢抬头。凤姐道：“你从今日不许过去！我什么时候叫你，你什么时候到。迟一步儿，你试试！出去罢！”兴儿忙答应几个“是”，退出门来。凤姐又叫道：“兴儿！”兴儿赶忙答应回来。凤姐道：“快出去告诉你二爷去，是不是啊？”兴儿回道：“奴才不敢。”凤姐道：“你出去提一个字儿，提防你的皮。”兴儿连忙答应着，才出去了，凤姐又叫：“旺儿呢？”旺儿连忙答应着过来。凤姐把眼直瞪瞪的瞅了两三句话的工夫，才说道：“好，旺儿！很好！去罢！外头有人提一个字儿，全在你身上！”旺儿答应着，也慢慢的退出去了。凤姐便叫：“倒茶。”小丫头子们会意，都出去了。\n这里凤姐才和平儿说：“你都听见了？这才好呢！”平儿也不敢答言，只好陪笑儿。凤姐越想越气，歪在枕上，只是出神。忽然眉头一皱，计上心来，便叫平儿来。平儿连忙答应过来，凤姐道：“我想这件事，竟该这么着才好，也不必等你二爷回来再商量了。”\n未知凤姐如何办理，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Third Sister’s suicide, her mother and Second Sister, as well as Chia Chen and Chia Lien, were grief-stricken. They lost no time in having her laid out and taken for burial outside the city. Liu Hsiang-lien was overwhelmed with remorse when he saw that she had killed herself. But the cold words of the Taoist priest awakened him from his infatuation. Then, cutting off his hair with his sword, he went off with that mad Taoist and disappeared.\n\nNow let us return to Aunt Hsueh. She had been delighted to hear that Hsiang-lien was engaged to marry Third Sister Yu. In high spirits, she had planned to buy a house for him and furnish it, then choose a lucky day for the wedding so as to repay him for saving her son’s life. Then suddenly some servants made an uproar, shouting, “Third Sister has killed herself!” Some maids heard this and told Aunt Hsueh, who had no idea of the reason and was most upset. While she was puzzling over it, Pao-chai came in from the Garden.\n\n“Have you heard, child?” her mother asked. “Third Sister, your Cousin Chen’s wife’s younger sister, who was engaged to your brother’s sworn brother Liu Hsiang-lien, has cut her throat for some reason; and now Hsiang-lien has disappeared too. How very strange! Who could have expected such a thing?”\n\nPao-chai however was quite unperturbed.\n\n“As the proverb says, ‘Storms gather without warning in nature, and bad luck befalls men overnight,’” she remarked. “This must have been fated. The other day, after he saved Pan’s life, you were talking about making preparations for his marriage; but now she’s dead and he’s gone. In my opinion, you should just accept the situation. There’s no need to grieve over it, mother. Since my brother came home from the south twenty days or so ago, the goods he brought back must have been sold by now. And the assistants who went with him have been back several months. I think you should discuss it with him, mother, and give a feast to thank them. We mustn’t let people think us unmannerly.”\n\nAs mother and daughter were talking, Hsueh Pan came in, his eyes still swollen from weeping. He clapped his hands at the sight of his mother.\n\n“Have you heard about Second Brother Liu and Third Sister Yu?” he cried.\n\n“I was just telling your sister,” she answered.\n\n“Have you heard that Hsiang-lien has gone off with a Taoist priest to become an immortal?”\n\n“How very strange! A young intellectual like Mr. Liu — how could he be so foolish as to go off with a Taoist? You were such good friends, and he’s all on his own here with no parents or brothers. You ought to go and look for him. That Taoist can’t have taken him far. They’re probably in some temple or monastery in the neighbourhood.”\n\n“Of course. As soon as I heard the news I took some servants to search for him, but there wasn’t a trace of him anywhere. I made inquiries, but nobody had seen him.”\n\n“Well, since you’ve searched for him without success, you’ve done your duty as a friend. Who knows, this may be a step up for him. But now you should attend to your business, and also make preparations for your own wedding. There aren’t many of us here, and as the proverb says, ‘A slow sparrow should make an early start.’ We mustn’t find, when the time comes, that we’ve forgotten this, that and the other, so that people laugh at us. Besides, your sister has just pointed out that you’ve been back more than a fortnight, so by now you must have sold all your goods; and you ought to give a feast for the assistants who went with you, to thank them for their hard work. They travelled two or three thousand li with you and put up with four or five months of hardship, not to mention all the anxiety and heavy responsibility they had to bear on the road for you.”\n\n“You’re quite right, mother,” agreed Hsueh Pan.\n\n\"You're very thoughtful, sister. I had the same idea, but these last few days I've been so busy dispatching goods to different places my head's in a whirl. And after all the bustle over Liu Er-ko which came to nothing, I've even been neglecting important business. Well, if not tomorrow, we can send out invitations for the day after.\"\n\n\"You fix it up,\" said Aunt Hsueh.\n\nJust then a servant announced that the chief manager had sent two cases of things.\n\n\"These are things the young master bought for himself, not included in the accounts,\" he reported. \"They'd have been sent before, but they were at the bottom of some cases and couldn't be got at. Now that all the goods have been dispatched, we're sending these today.\"\n\nAs he spoke, two pages carried in two large palm-wood cases fastened with clamps. At sight of them Hsueh Pan exclaimed:\n\n\"Good heavens, how could I be such an idiot? I specially brought these things for my mother and sister, then clean forgot them and didn't bring them home. So the assistants have sent them now.\"\n\n\"Some things you 'specially brought'!\" scoffed Pao-chai. \"Left behind for twenty days! If you hadn't 'specially brought' them, most likely they wouldn't have reached us till the end of the year. I really think you're too casual about everything.\"\n\nHsueh Pan laughed.\n\n\"I suppose on the road my soul was beaten out of me and hasn't found its way back yet.\"\n\nThey all laughed at this. Then he told a maid, \"Go and tell the servants to take the cases and send the men back.\"\n\nAunt Hsueh and Pao-chai asked what the cases contained, all roped up like that.\n\nHsueh Pan ordered some servants to untie the ropes and remove the clamps. When the lock was opened and the lid raised, the first case was found to contain silks, satins, brocades and foreign materials for everyday use.\n\n\"That other case has things I brought for my sister,\" said Hsueh Pan with a smile, opening it himself.\n\nMother and daughter saw that it was full of writing-brushes, ink, paper, ink-slabs, note-paper in different colours, perfumed pouches, beads, fans, fan pendants, perfumed powder and rouge, as well as such novelties from Hu-chiu as mechanical dolls, a drinking-game, a little tumbler weighted with quicksilver, a sandpicture, and operatic figures in a gauze-covered box. There was also a clay statuette of Hsueh Pan made on Hu-chiu Hill, a perfect likeness. Pao-chai paid no attention to the other things, but this statuette of her brother she had to examine carefully, comparing it with the original; and she could not help laughing. She told Ying-erh to take some old nurses and carry all these things to the Garden. After a little more casual talk with her mother and brother she went back to the Garden too.\n\nAunt Hsueh had the things in the other case taken out and carefully divided up into lots to be sent by Tung-hsi to the Lady Dowager, Lady Wang and others. But no more of this.\n\nPao-chai, upon reaching her own room, went through the novelties one by one. Apart from what she kept for herself, she made a suitable selection of the rest: writing-brushes, ink, paper and ink-slabs for some, perfumed pouches, fans and pendants for others, or powder and rouge and hair-oil; and some received nothing but toys. Only Tai-yu received twice as many presents as the others.\n\nWhen all had been parcelled out, she told Ying-erh to take an old nurse and deliver them to the different apartments. The other girls accepted their gifts and rewarded the messengers, saying they would come to thank Pao-chai in person. But the sight of these things from her native place upset Tai-yu, reminding her that she had no home of her own now as both her parents were dead, with no brother to bring her local products.\n\n\"Other people have people to bring them presents,\" she thought.\n\nAnd she burst into tears again.\n\nTzu-chuan knew what was in her mind, but not liking to speak of it she simply tried to comfort her.\n\nZijuan, who was at her side, advised, “You’re always poorly, miss, and have to take medicine all the time. The last couple of days you seemed a little better, and though you’ve perked up a bit you’re still not well. Now that Miss Baochai has sent you these things, you can see how much she thinks of you. You should be pleased instead of upset. Are you going to make her feel she’s annoyed you by sending a present? If she heard that, she’d feel embarrassed. Besides, the old lady and your mother have been doing all they can to find good doctors to prescribe for you and treat you, all for your sake. If you cry now that you’re a little better, you’ll only make yourself worse and worry them again. You fell ill in the first place, miss, because you fretted too much and upset your system. A young lady of your position shouldn’t run yourself down like this.”\n\nAs Zijuan was speaking, a maid in the courtyard announced, “Master Bao is here.”\n\nZijuan promptly called, “Ask him in, please.”\n\nBaoyu walked in and Daiyu invited him to take a seat. Seeing her tear-stained face he asked, “Who’s been upsetting you again, cousin?”\n\nShe forced a smile. “No one. I’ve no reason to be upset.”\n\nZijuan nodded towards the table behind the bed and, taking the hint, Baoyu turned to look. When he saw the pile of things there he realized that Baochai must have sent them.\n\n“Well!” he quipped. “What are all those things? Are you thinking of opening a shop?”\n\nDaiyu made no answer.\n\nZijuan laughed. “Don’t talk about those things, sir. The sight of Miss Baochai’s present set our young lady crying. I was trying to comfort her when you turned up. How very opportune! Do help me to reason with her.”\n\nBaoyu knew the reason for this, but he did not like to say so. He simply joked, “I know why you’re upset, cousin. Because Cousin Baochai sent so little. Don’t worry. Next year I’ll tell people to bring you two whole boat-loads from the South, to stop you crying.”\n\nDaiyu knew he was trying to cheer her up. She could neither ignore this nor take offence, but said, “I may be ignorant, but I’m not as childish as all that. Do you really think me so small-minded? I have my own reasons. You wouldn’t understand.”\n\nWith that she started crying again.\n\nBaoyu stepped to the bedside and sat down beside her.\n\n“I can see you’re rather overwrought today, cousin,” he said gently. “It stands to reason, if you think it over calmly, that your health should come first. You’re not well yet, and crying won’t help. So even if you want to cry, you should take better care of yourself. That’s only common sense.”\n\nMeanwhile he had picked up the presents one by one to examine them, asking, “What’s this called?” or “What’s that made of? It’s so finely wrought.” Or, “What’s this for?” And he remarked, “You could put this here for people to see,” and “This would look well on that table over there, like an antique.” He was simply talking at random to distract her.\n\nDaiyu, seeing this, felt rather apologetic.\n\n“No need to stay here and fool around,” she said. “Why not go and call on Cousin Baochai?”\n\nBaoyu was only too glad to get her out to take her mind off her troubles.\n\n“Right you are,” he agreed. “Since she sent us these things, we ought to go and thank her.”\n\n“There’s no need between us sisters. But I’d like to go over all the same. Her elder brother’s back now and must have told her about some southern sights and customs. If I go to hear about them, it will be just like going home for a visit.”\n\nHer eyes reddened again.\n\nSo Baoyu stood waiting while she got ready.\n\nHe went off with her to call on Baochai.\n\nNow Xue Pan, on his mother’s advice, had quickly sent out invitations and prepared a feast. The next day, when the four managers he had invited had all arrived, they talked of business matters such as sales, accounts and the consignment of goods. Soon they were asked to the table and Xue Pan poured wine for each in turn, after which Aunt Xue sent a maid out to convey her greetings. They drank as they chatted.\n\nOne of the managers remarked, “Two good friends are missing from this feast.”\n\nAsked whom he meant, he answered, “Who else but Master Lien of the Jia family and Master Liu, the sworn brother of our young master?”\n\nThe others chimed in, “Yes, that’s right. Why didn’t you invite them?”\n\nXue Pan frowned and sighed. “Master Lien has left for Pinganzhou. He set out a couple of days ago. And as for Master Liu, don’t mention him! The most amazing thing has happened. He’s no longer ‘Master Liu’ but ‘Taoist Liu’ now — goodness knows where!”\n\nThey exclaimed in surprise, “What do you mean?”\n\nThen Xue Pan told them the whole story of Liu Xianglian.\n\nEven more astounded, they said, “No wonder the other day in our shop we seemed to hear people gossiping that a Taoist priest had converted a young man with just a few words, then whisked him away on a gust of wind. But we didn’t know who it was. We were checking goods at the time and had no time to ask for details. We only half believed it. So it was Master Liu! If we’d known, we should have reasoned with him. Whatever happened, we oughtn’t to have let him go.”\n\n“Maybe it didn’t happen like that,” said one.\n\nAsked what he meant, he explained, “A smart young fellow like Master Liu may not really have followed that Taoist. He was a good boxer and very strong. Maybe he saw through the Taoist’s witchcraft and went after him to settle scores with him in secret.”\n\n“If that’s how it was, well and good,” said Xue Pan. “How is it nobody does anything about these swindlers who deceive people with such demon talk?”\n\n“In that case, didn’t you know it and go looking for him?”\n\n“I searched for him everywhere inside and outside the city. Don’t laugh at me, but I actually cried when I couldn’t find him.” Heaving sighs, he looked most downcast — not at all his usual cheerful self.\n\nSeeing this, the managers could not stay long. After drinking a few cups of wine and eating rice they took their leave.\n\nBut let us return to Baoyu, who had accompanied Daiyu to Baochai’s place.\n\n“Our elder cousin took the trouble to bring these things back,” he said to Baochai. “You should have kept them for yourself, cousin, instead of giving them to us.”\n\n“They’re nothing special, just a few native products,” she replied. “I thought you might find them amusing, that’s all.”\n\nDaiyu said, “When we were small we didn’t notice such things, but now that we’re older they seem quite novel.”\n\nBaochai smiled. “As the saying goes, ‘things are valued more away from home.’ But these really aren’t worth much.”\n\nThis remark touched on Daiyu’s recent homesickness, and Baoyu tried to cover up by saying quickly, “Next year, when our elder cousin goes there again, be sure to get him to bring us more.”\n\nShe shot him a glance. “If you want more, say so. Why drag me in? Look, cousin,” she said to Baochai, “instead of thanking you for the presents, he’s putting in an order for next year already.”\n\nBaochai and Baoyu laughed.\n\nThe three of them chatted for a while, and the conversation turned to Daiyu’s illness.\n\nPao-chai having tried to console her went on, “If you’re feeling low, cousin, you should force yourself to come out for a stroll to distract yourself. That’s better than moping indoors. The other day when I felt too lazy to move and was burning all over, all I wanted was to lie down. But I was afraid of falling ill because the weather’s so treacherous, so I made myself find something to do; and that’s made me feel much better the last couple of days.”\n\n“Of course you’re right,” said Tai-yu. “I feel the same.”\n\nAfter sitting there a little longer they broke up. Pao-yu saw Tai-yu back to the gate of Bamboo Lodge before going home.\n\nNow the presents given to Chia Huan by Pao-chai had pleased his mother Aunt Chao so much that she thought:\n\n“No wonder everyone says how good Pao-chai is, what a sweet way she has with people and how generous. Now I can see for myself it’s true. How much can her brother have brought back, yet she’s made presents to everyone, not missing a single one, and shown no favouritism either. Why, she’s even remembered a luckless creature like me. If it were that Lin girl, she wouldn’t so much as look at the two of us, mother and son, let alone give us presents.”\n\nTurning the gifts over and over in her hands, she suddenly thought, “Pao-chai is Lady Wang’s niece. Why shouldn’t I go and show her these to curry favour?”\n\nSo, taking the gifts, she crept fawningly into Lady Wang’s apartments and stood beside her.\n\n“These are for your Huan from Miss Pao-chai,” she said with a smile. “Think how young she is, yet so considerate — a real young lady of good family, so proper and open-handed. No wonder everyone’s so fond of her and the old lady and Your Ladyship are for ever praising her. I didn’t like to put these away without first showing them to you to make you happy too.”\n\nLady Wang knew at once what had brought her. And because her remarks were so uncalled for she could not very well ignore her.\n\n“Just take them for Huan to play with,” she said.\n\nAunt Chao had come in high glee, but this rebuff made her quite crestfallen. Although furious, she dared not show it and had to leave in embarrassment. Back in her own room she tossed the things aside.\n\n“What sort of way is that to behave?” she fumed, sitting there sulking.\n\nMeanwhile Ying-erh and the matrons who had helped to deliver the presents reported back to Pao-chai, telling her how everyone had thanked her and what tips they had been given. When the old women had left, Ying-erh stepped up to her mistress.\n\n“Just now, when I went to the Second Mistress’ place, I found her looking very put out,” she whispered. “After I’d given her the presents and come away, I asked Hsiao-hung on the quiet what was the matter. She said, ‘The Second Mistress came back from the old lady’s in quite a different mood from usual — not her usual cheerful self. She called Ping-erh in and they had a long, low-voiced talk about something.’ It looked as if something serious had happened. Did you hear of anything wrong at the old lady’s, miss?”\n\nThis puzzled Pao-chai, who could not imagine why Hsi-feng should be angry.\n\n“Every family has its own troubles,” she said. “What’s that to do with us? Go and make some tea.”\n\nYing-erh went off to do this.\n\nTo return to Pao-yu. After seeing Tai-yu home he reflected sadly on her loneliness. He would have liked to tell Hsi-jen this, but on entering his room found only Sheh-yueh and Chiu-wen there.\n\n“Where’s Hsi-jen?” he asked.\n\n“She must be somewhere in these compounds,” said Sheh-yueh. “How could she get lost?”\n\n“Fancy having to hunt for people the moment my back is turned,” he chuckled. “I wasn’t afraid of losing her, but just now when I called on Miss Lin I found her crying again. When I asked the reason, she said it was because Miss Bao had given her some presents which reminded her of her home. I was going to ask Xiren to go over and cheer her up.”\n\nJust then Qingwen came in. “So you’re back,” she said. “Who is it you want to cheer up?”\n\nWhen he had explained she told him, “Xiren’s just gone out. I heard her say she was going to see Madam Lian, and she may look in on Miss Lin too.”\n\nBaoyu said no more. Qiuwen brought him tea. He rinsed his mouth and handed the cup to a young maid, then lay down on his bed feeling put out.\n\nAfter Baoyu’s departure Xiren had done some sewing, then it occurred to her that Xifeng had been unwell and she had not called for the last few days. And since Jia Lian was away from home, this would be a good time for a chat. She told Qingwen, “Do stay in and mind the house. Don’t all go out, so that there’s no one here when the master gets back.”\n\n“Goodness!” exclaimed Qingwen. “You’re the only one who worries about him; the rest of us just idle and eat for nothing.”\n\nXiren smiled and went off without answering.\n\nShe had just reached the bridge by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion. It was the beginning of autumn, when some lotus leaves in the pool were still green while others were beginning to wither. As she strolled along the embankment enjoying the sight, she looked up and noticed someone under the grape trellis flicking a duster about. Going closer she saw it was Granny Zhu. The old woman smiled at her.\n\n“What wind brings you here today, miss?” she asked.\n\n“I’m on my way to see Madam Lian. What are you doing here?”\n\n“Driving off the wasps. We’ve had so little rain this summer that there are insects on all the fruit trees, and they’ve scarred a lot of the grapes. Wasps are the worst. If they puncture two or three grapes in a bunch, the juice that drips out rots all the rest. Look, while we’ve been talking they’ve settled again.”\n\n“Even if you keep flicking your duster all the time, you can’t drive them all away. The best thing would be to get the stewards to make lots of little bags of thin gauze to cover each bunch. That would keep the wasps off and let the grapes ripen.”\n\n“That’s a good idea, miss. But this is my first year in charge here, so I didn’t know that trick.”\n\n“Although we’ve lost some fruit this year, it tastes good,” she went on. “Try one, miss, and see if I’m not right.”\n\n“That would never do,” said Xiren sternly. “It’s not ripe enough to eat yet; and even when it is, we mustn’t touch it before it’s been offered to the ancestors. As an old servant you should know the rules of the house.”\n\n“You’re quite right, miss,” said the old woman apologetically. “It’s just because I know how kind you are that I made so bold, but that was against the rules. I must be getting old and silly.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter. But you older servants shouldn’t be the ones to start this sort of thing.”\n\nWith that she left the Garden and made her way to Xifeng’s compound. As she entered the courtyard she heard Xifeng exclaim:\n\n“Heaven strike me dead if I’m not telling the truth! All the hard work I’ve put in here has turned me into a thief!”\n\nXiren, not knowing what lay behind this, could neither turn back nor go in. She decided to step forward noisily.\n\n“Is Sister Ping at home?” she asked through the window.\n\nPing’er hastily answered and went out to meet her.\n\n“Is the Second Mistress at home too?” asked Xiren. “Is she better now?”\n\nAs she spoke she entered the room. Xifeng, who had been reclining on the couch, rose to her feet with a smile at sight of her.\n\n“I’m better, thank you for your concern,” she said. “Why haven’t you dropped in these last few days?”\n\n“As you’ve been unwell, madam, I should have come every day to pay my respects. But I was afraid that if you weren’t well my visit might disturb you.”\n\n“Nonsense. I’m only too pleased to see you. Though there are plenty of maids in Master Bao’s place, you’re the only one who really looks after him, and you can’t get away. But Ping’er often tells me you’re always asking after me behind my back. That shows your good heart.”\n\nShe ordered Ping’er to place a stool by the couch for Xiren, and Feng’er brought in tea.\n\n“Don’t trouble to wait on me, sister,” said Xiren, half rising.\n\nThey chatted for a while until a young maid came into the outer room and whispered to Ping’er, “Wang’er is here waiting at the inner gate.”\n\nThey heard Ping’er whisper back, “I know. Tell him to go away now and come back later. He’s not to stand at the gate.”\n\nRealizing that they had business to attend to, Xiren after a few more words stood up to take her leave.\n\n“Do drop in for a chat when you’ve time,” said Xifeng. “I enjoy talking to you.” She told Ping’er, “See your sister out.”\n\nPing’er assented and went out with Xiren. They found two or three young maids waiting there in dead silence. Xiren, not knowing what was afoot, went her way.\n\nPing’er on her return announced, “Wang’er came just now, but as Xiren was here I told him to wait outside. Should I send for him at once or let him wait? What are your instructions, madam?”\n\n“Bring him in.”\n\nPing’er sent a young maid to fetch him.\n\n“How exactly did you hear that talk?” Xifeng asked her.\n\n“It was what that maid reported. She said she’d heard two pages outside the inner gate say, ‘This new second mistress is even better-looking than the old one, and has a sweeter temper too.’ She didn’t know who Wang’er was, but he scolded them, ‘What do you mean by “new mistress, old mistress”? Shut up! If those inside get to hear of this, they’ll cut your tongues off!’”\n\nAs she was speaking a young maid came in to announce that Wang’er was waiting outside.\n\nXifeng gave a scornful laugh. “Bring him in!” she ordered.\n\nThe maid went out and called him in.\n\nWang’er stepped in and paid his respects, then stood at attention by the door of the outer room.\n\n“Come here,” said Xifeng. “I want to ask you something.”\n\nHe went over to stand by the door of the inner room.\n\n“Do you know that your Second Master has taken a concubine outside?” she demanded.\n\nWang’er bent one knee in a salute.\n\n“How could I know that, madam, when my job is to wait at the second gate?” he replied.\n\n“Of course you ‘wouldn’t know’,” she sneered. “If you didn’t, why did you try to stop people talking?”\n\nThis showed Wang’er that the cat was out of the bag and he could not hide the truth. He fell on both knees.\n\n“I really didn’t know, madam,” he pleaded. “It was just Xing’er and Xi’er talking nonsense, and I gave them a scolding. I don’t know the inside story.\n\n\"I wouldn’t dare to say, madam. You’d better ask Xing-er who often goes out with the master.”\n\nXifeng spat furiously. “You heartless bastards are all in cahoots!” she swore. “Don’t think I don’t know what goes on. First go and fetch that bastard Xing-er, but don’t you dare leave too. When I’ve got the truth out of him I’ll deal with you. So this is the kind of service I get from you — fine!”\n\nWang-er had to answer, “Yes, madam,” several times. He kotowed, scrambled to his feet and went to fetch Xing-er.\n\nXing-er was amusing himself with some pages in the counting-house when the announcement “The mistress wants you” threw him into a panic. However, it did not occur to him that this summons had to do with his master’s affair. He promptly accompanied Wang-er back.\n\nWang-er went in first to announce, “Xing-er is here.”\n\n“Bring him in!” snapped Xifeng.\n\nHearing this, Xing-er’s heart failed him. He had to pluck up courage to go in.\n\n“Fine doings, my fine lad, you and your master have been up to!” she said at sight of him. “Out with the truth now.”\n\nThe tone of her voice, the look on her face and the attitude of the maids so terrified Xing-er that his legs gave way and he fell on his knees to kotow.\n\n“I’ve heard that you weren’t to blame for this,” she said. “But you should have reported it to me at once. That was wrong of you. If you tell me the truth now, I’ll let you off. But if you try to fool me with one word of a lie, just see how many heads you have on your shoulders!”\n\nXing-er tremblingly raised his head to ask, “What have the master and I done wrong, madam?”\n\nAll Xifeng’s anger flared up.\n\n“Slap his face!” she cried.\n\nAs Wang-er stepped forward to do this she swore, “You stupid bastard! Let him slap his own face. What call have you to do it for him? You’ll have time enough later to slap your own face.”\n\nXing-er had to slap his own face left and right a dozen times and more.\n\n“Stop!” ordered Xifeng. “Well, don’t you know what ‘new mistress’ or ‘old mistress’ your master has married outside?”\n\nThis threw Xing-er into a greater panic. Tearing off his cap he knocked his head loudly on the floor.\n\n“Spare me, madam!” he begged. “I wouldn’t dare tell a single lie.”\n\n“Out with it, then.”\n\nXing-er straightened up and knelt erect to report, “To start with, your slave knew nothing about it. It was the day of the funeral in the East Mansion, when Yu Lu went to the temple to ask Master Zhen for some silver, that the master took Master Rong to the East Mansion. On the way they started talking about the two young ladies in Mistress Zhen’s house. The master praised their good looks, and Master Rong egged him on, proposing that he should marry Second Sister You.”\n\n“Ugh!” Xifeng spat in disgust. “You shameless bastard! What mistress is she of yours?”\n\nXing-er kotowed. “May I die if I dare tell a lie,” he protested. He looked up but dared say no more.\n\n“Is that all?” demanded Xifeng. “Why have you stopped?”\n\n“If you’ll excuse me, madam, I’ll go on.”\n\n“Shit! What ‘excuse’ me? Just get on with your story, and mind it’s a full one.”\n\n“The master was delighted by this proposal. Later on, I don’t know how, it came true.”\n\n“Of course it came true,” she sneered. “How should you know? I’m sure you know all the details.”\n\n\"Exactly!\" she cried. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Then Master Rong found a house for Master Lien,\" continued Xingr.\n\n\"Where is this house?\" Xifeng demanded.\n\n\"Just behind our mansion.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Xifeng turned to glare at Pinger. \"Are we all dead? Did you hear that?\"\n\nPinger dared not reply.\n\nXingr went on, \"Lord Zhen gave the Zhang family some silver — I don't know how much — and they made no more trouble.\"\n\n\"What have the Zhangs and Lis to do with it?\" asked Xifeng.\n\n\"You don't know, madam. This second mistress —\" He broke off to slap his own face, making Xifeng smile while the other maids giggled.\n\nAfter a moment's reflection he said, \"The younger sister of Madam Yu —\"\n\n\"What about her?\" Xifeng cut in. \"Out with it.\"\n\n\"The younger sister of Madam Yu was betrothed as a child to a certain Zhang Hua, but his family's so poor now they're almost beggars. So Lord Zhen gave him some silver and he broke off the engagement.\"\n\nXifeng nodded at this and turned to the maids. \"Did you hear that, you young turtles? Just now he claimed to know nothing about it.\"\n\nXingr continued, \"Later, the master had the house furnished and married her.\"\n\n\"Where was she married from?\"\n\n\"From her mother's place.\"\n\n\"I see. Who accompanied the bride?\"\n\n\"Just Master Rong and some maids and old nurses, no one else.\"\n\n\"Didn't your mistress go?\"\n\n\"Not till a couple of days later, when she took some things over as presents.\"\n\nXifeng smiled at Pinger. \"No wonder the master couldn't stop singing her praises the last couple of days.\" She turned back to Xingr. \"Who waited on them? You, I suppose?\"\n\nXingr kowtowed but said nothing.\n\nXifeng asked, \"The last few days, when he said he had business in the other mansion, I suppose this was it?\"\n\n\"Sometimes he had business, sometimes he went to the new house.\"\n\n\"Who lives there with her?\"\n\n\"Her mother and her sister. Yesterday her sister cut her own throat.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nXingr told her then about Liu Xianglian.\n\n\"She was lucky,\" was Xifeng's comment. \"She escaped being a notorious trollop. Is that all?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything else, madam. I've told you the whole truth. If you find I've lied, you can beat me to death and I shan't complain.\"\n\nXifening lowered her head for a while, then pointed at Xingr. \"You young scamp! You deserve to be beaten to death. Why try to hide this from me? Did you hope to get into your muddle-headed master's good books by keeping me in the dark? Your new mistress is very fond of you, I'm sure. If you hadn't shown just now that you're still a little afraid of me and don't dare tell lies, I'd have broken both your legs!\" She snorted, \"Get up!\"\n\nXingr kowtowed and stood up, then withdrew to the outer door but dared not leave.\n\n\"Come here!\" Xifeng called. \"I've more to say.\"\n\nXinger stepped back respectfully, his arms at his sides.\n\n\"What's the hurry? Is your new mistress waiting to reward you?\"\n\nXingr hung his head.\n\n\"From today I forbid you to go there,\" she said. \"When I call for you, come at once. If you don't, just wait and see!\n\n\"Come here! When will you arrive? If you’re one step late, just see what’ll happen to you! Now get out!”\n\nXing-er hastily assented and backed out.\n\n“Xing-er!” Xifeng called again, and he hurried back.\n\n“Go and tell your Second Master, quick, that I know what he’s been up to.”\n\n“I wouldn’t dare, madam.”\n\n“If you breathe one word outside, I’ll have your hide!”\n\nHe promised to obey and was slinking away when she called, “Where is Wang-er?”\n\nWang-er stepped forward.\n\nXifeng stared at him for a while in silence.\n\n“Good, Wang-er! Very good!” she said at last. “Off you go. If anyone outside hears a word of this, you’ll have to answer for it.”\n\nWang-er assented and slowly withdrew.\n\n“Tea!” Xifeng called.\n\nThe young maids, taking the hint, all left the room.\n\nThen Xifeng told Pinger, “You heard? This is fine goings-on!”\n\nPinger dared not reply, but simply smiled. Xifeng, working herself up into a rage, lay back on her pillow to think. Suddenly an idea struck her.\n\n“Pinger!” she called.\n\nPinger came over at once.\n\n“I think this is what we should do,” said Xifeng. “There’s no need to wait for your Second Master to come back and talk it over.”\n\nTo know what Xifeng proposed to do, read the next chapter."
