  "original": "话说周瑞家的送了刘老老去后，便上来回王夫人话，谁知王夫人不在上房，问丫鬟们，方知往薛姨妈那边说话儿去了。周瑞家的听说，便出东角门过东院往梨香院来。刚至院门前，只见王夫人的丫鬟金钏儿和那一个才留头的小女孩儿站在台阶儿上玩呢。看见周瑞家的进来，便知有话来回，因往里努嘴儿。\n　　周瑞家的轻轻掀帘进去，见王夫人正和薛姨妈长篇大套的说些家务人情话。周瑞家的不敢惊动，遂进里间来。只见薛宝钗家常打扮，头上只挽着，伏在几上和丫鬟莺儿正在那里描花样子呢。见他进来，便放下笔，转过身，满面堆笑让：“周姐姐坐。”周瑞家的也忙陪笑问道：“姑娘好？”一面炕沿边坐了，因说：“这有两三天也没见姑娘到那边逛逛去，只怕是你宝兄弟冲撞了你不成？”宝钗笑道：“那里的话。只因我那宗病又发了，所以且静养两天。”周瑞家的道：“正是呢。姑娘到底有什么病根儿？也该趁早请个大夫认真医治医治。小小的年纪儿倒作下个病根儿，也不是玩的呢。”宝钗听说笑道：“再别提起这个病！也不知请了多少大夫，吃了多少药，花了多少钱，总不见一点效验儿。后来还亏了一个和尚，专治无名的病症，因请他看了。他说我这是从胎里带来的一股热毒，幸而我先天壮还不相干，要是吃凡药是不中用的。他就说了个海上仙方儿，又给了一包末药作引子，异香异气的。他说犯了时吃一丸就好了。倒也奇怪，这倒效验些。”周瑞家的因问道：“不知是什么方儿？姑娘说了，我们也好记着说给人知道。要遇见这样病，也是行好的事。”宝钗笑道：“不问这方儿还好，若问这方儿，真把人琐碎死了！东西药料一概却都有限，最难得是‘可巧’二子：要春天开的白牡丹花蕊十二两，夏天开的白荷花蕊十二两，秋天开的白芙蓉蕊十二两，冬天开的白梅花蕊十二两。将这四样花蕊于次年春分这一天晒干，和在末药一处，一齐研好，又要雨水这日的天落水十二钱……”周瑞家的笑道：“嗳呀，这么说就得三年的工夫呢。倘或雨水这日不下雨，可又怎么着呢？”宝钗笑道：“所以了，那里有这么可巧的雨？也只好再等罢了。还要白露这日的露水十二钱，霜降这日的霜十二钱，小雪这日的雪十二钱。把这四样水调匀了，丸了龙眼大的丸子，盛在旧磁坛里，埋在花根底下。若发了病的时候儿，拿出来吃一丸，用一钱二分黄柏煎汤送下。”周瑞家的听了，笑道：“阿弥陀佛！真巧死了人。等十年还未必碰的全呢！”宝钗道：“竟好。自他去后，一二年间，可巧都得了，好容易配成一料。如今从家里带了来，现埋在梨花树底下。”周瑞家的又道：“这药有名字没有呢？”宝钗道：“有。也是那和尚说的，叫作‘冷香丸’。”周瑞家的听了点头儿，因又说：“这病发了时，到底怎么着？”宝钗道：“也不觉什么，不过只喘嗽些，吃一丸也就罢了。”\n　　周瑞家的还说话时，忽听王夫人问道：“谁在里头？”周瑞家的忙出来答应了，便回了刘老老之事。略待半刻，见王夫人无话，方欲退出去，薛姨妈忽又笑道：“你且站住。我有一件东西，你带了去罢。”说着便叫：“香菱！”帘拢响处，才和金钏儿玩的那个小丫头进来，问：“太太叫我做什么？”薛姨妈道：“把那匣子里的花儿拿来。”香菱答应了，向那边棒了个小锦匣儿来。薛姨妈道：“这是宫里头作的新鲜花样儿堆纱花，十二枝。昨儿我想起来，白放着可惜旧了，何不给他们姐妹们戴去。昨儿要送去，偏又忘了；你今儿来得巧，就带了去罢。你家的三位姑娘每位两枝，下剩六枝送林姑娘两枝，那四枝给凤姐儿罢。”王夫人道：“留着给宝丫头戴也罢了，又想着他们。”薛姨妈道：“姨太太不知，宝丫头怪着呢，他从来不爱这些花儿粉儿的。”\n　　说着，周瑞家的拿了匣子，走出房门。见金钏儿仍在那里晒日阳儿，周瑞家的问道：“那香菱小丫头子可就是时常说的，临上京时买的、为他打人命官司的那个小丫头吗？”金钏儿道：“可不就是他。”正说着，只见香菱笑嘻嘻的走来，周瑞家的便拉了他的手细细的看了一回，因向金钏儿笑道：“这个模样儿，竟有些象咱们东府里的小蓉奶奶的品格儿。金钏儿道；“我也这么说呢。”周瑞家的又问香菱：“你几岁投身到这里？”又问：“你父母在那里呢？今年十几了？本处是那里的人？”香菱听问，摇头说：“不记得了。”周瑞家的和金钏儿听了，倒反为叹息了一回。\n　　一时周瑞家的携花至王夫人正房后。原来近日贾母说孙女们太多，一处挤着倒不便，只留宝玉、黛玉二人在这边解闷，却将迎春、探春、惜春三人移到王夫人这边房后三间抱厦内居住，令李纨陪伴照管。如今周瑞家的故顺路先往这里来，只见几个小丫头都在抱厦内默坐，听着呼唤。迎春的丫鬟司棋和探春的丫鬟侍书二人，正掀帘子出来，手里都捧着茶盘茶钟，周瑞家的便知他姐妹在一处坐着，也进入房内。只见迎春、探春二人正在窗下围棋。周瑞家的将花送上，说明原故，二人忙住了棋，都欠身道谢，命丫鬟们收了。\n　　周瑞家的答应了，因说：“四姑娘不在房里，只怕在老太太那边呢？”丫鬟们道：“在那屋里不是？”周瑞家的听了，便往这边屋里来。只见惜春正同水月庵的小姑子智能儿两个一处玩耍呢，见周瑞家的进来，便问他何事。周瑞家的将花匣打开，说明原故，惜春笑道：“我这里正和智能儿说，我明儿也要剃了头跟他作姑子去呢。可巧又送了花来，要剃了头，可把花儿戴在那里呢？”说着，大家取笑一回，惜春命丫鬟收了。周瑞家的因问智能儿：“你是什么时候来的？你师父那秃歪剌那里去了？”智能儿道：“我们一早就来了。我师父见过太太，就往于老爷府里去了，叫我在这里等他呢。”周瑞家的又道：“十五的月例香供银子可得了没有？”智能儿道：“不知道。”惜春便问周瑞家的：“如今各庙月例银子是谁管着？”周瑞家的道：“余信管着。”惜春听了笑道：“这就是了。他师父一来了，余信家的就赶上来，和他师父咕唧了半日，想必就是为这个事了。”\n　　那周瑞家的又和智能儿唠叨了一回，便往凤姐处来。穿过了夹道子，从李纨后窗下越过西花墙，出西角门，进凤姐院中。走至堂屋，只见小丫头丰儿坐在房门槛儿上，见周瑞家的来了，连忙的摆手儿，叫他往东屋里去。周瑞家的会意，忙着蹑手蹑脚儿的往东边屋里来，只见奶子拍着大姐儿睡觉呢。周瑞家的悄悄儿问道：“二奶奶睡中觉吗？也该清醒了。”奶子笑着，撇着嘴摇头儿。正问着，只听那边微有笑声儿，却是贾琏的声音。接着房门响，平儿拿着大铜盆出来，叫人舀水。平儿便进这边来，见了周瑞家的，便问：“你老人家又来作什么？”周瑞家的忙起身拿匣子给他看道：“送花儿来了。”平儿听了，便打开匣子，拿了四技，抽身去了。半刻工夫，手里拿出两枝来，先叫彩明来，吩咐：“送到那边府里，给小蓉大奶奶戴的。”次后方命周瑞家的回去道谢。\n　　周瑞家的这才往贾母这边来，过了穿堂，顶头忽见他的女孩儿打扮着才从他婆家来。周瑞家的忙问：“你这会子跑来作什么？”他女孩儿说：“妈，一向身上好？我在家里等了这半日，妈竟不去，什么事情这么忙的不回家？我等烦了，自己先到了老太太跟前请了安了，这会子请太太的安去，妈还有什么不了的差事？手里是什么东西？”周瑞家的笑道：“嗳！今儿偏偏来了个刘老老，我自己多事，为他跑了半日。这会子叫姨太太看见了，叫送这几枝花儿给姑娘奶奶们去，这还没有送完呢。你今儿来，一定有什么事情。”他女孩儿笑道：“你老人家倒会猜，一猜就猜着了。实对你老人家说，你女婿因前儿多喝了点子酒，和人分争起来，不知怎么叫人放了把邪火，说他来历不明，告到衙门里，要递解还乡。所以我来和你老人家商量商量，讨个情分。不知求那个可以了事？”周瑞家的听了道：“我就知道，这算什么大事，忙的这么着！你先家去，等我送下林姑娘的花儿就回去。这会儿太太、二奶奶都不得闲儿呢。”他女孩儿听说，便回去了，还说：“妈，好歹快来。”周瑞家的道：“是了罢！小人儿家没经过什么事，就急的这么个样儿。”说着，便到黛玉房中去了。\n　　谁知此时黛玉不在自己房里，却在宝玉房中，大家解九连环作戏。周瑞家的进来，笑道：“林姑娘，姨太太叫我送花儿来了。”宝玉听说，便说：“什么花儿？拿来我瞧瞧。”一面伸手接过匣子来看时，原来是两枝宫制堆纱新巧的假花。黛玉只就宝玉手中看了一看，便问道：“还是单送我一个人的，还是别的姑娘们都有呢？”周瑞家的道；“各位都有了，这两枝是姑娘的。”黛玉冷笑道：“我就知道么，别人不挑剩下的也不给我呀。”周瑞家的听了，一声儿也不敢言语。宝玉问道：“周姐姐，你作什么到那边去了？”周瑞家的因说：“太太在那里，我回话去了，姨太太就顺便叫我带来的。”宝玉道；“宝姐姐在家里作什么呢？怎么这几日也不过来？”周瑞家的道；“身上不大好呢。”宝玉听了，便和丫头们说：“谁去瞧瞧，就说我和林姑娘打发来问姨娘、姐姐安，问姐姐是什么病，吃什么药。论理，我该亲自来的，就说才从学里回来，也着了些凉，改日再亲自来看。”说着，茜雪便答应去了。周瑞家的自去无话。\n　　原来周瑞家的女婿便是雨村的好友冷子兴，近日因卖古董，和人打官司，故叫人来讨情。周瑞家的仗着主子的势，把这些事也不放在心上，晚上只求求凤姐便完了。\n　　至掌灯时，凤姐卸了妆，来见王夫人，回说：“今儿甄家送了来的东西，我已收了。咱们送他的，趁着他家有年下送鲜的船，交给他带了去了。”王夫人点点头儿。凤姐又道：“临安伯老太太生日的礼已经打点了，太太派谁送去？”王夫人道：“你瞧谁闲着，叫四个女人去就完了，又来问我。”凤姐道：“今日珍大嫂子来，请我明日去逛逛，明日有什么事没有？”王夫人道：“有事没事都碍不着什么。每常他来请，有我们，你自然不便，他不请我们单请你，可知是他的诚心，叫你散荡散荡。别辜负了他的心，倒该过去走走才是。”凤姐答应了。当下李纨、探春等妹妹们也都定省毕，各归房无话。\n　　次日凤姐梳洗了，先回王夫人毕，方来辞贾母。宝玉听了，也要逛去，凤姐只得答应着。立等换了衣裳，姐儿两个坐了车。一时进入宁府，早有贾珍之妻尤氏与贾蓉媳妇秦氏，婆媳两个带着多少侍妾丫鬟等接出仪门。那尤氏一见凤姐，必先嘲笑一阵，一手拉了宝玉，同入上房里坐下。秦氏献了茶。凤姐便说：“你们请我来作什么？拿什么孝敬我？有东西就献上来罢，我还有事呢。”尤氏未及答应，几个媳妇们先笑道：“二奶奶今日不来就罢，既来了，就依不得你老人家了。”正说着，只见贾蓉进来请安。宝玉因道：“大哥哥今儿不在家么？”尤氏道：“今儿出城请老爷的安去了。”又道：“可是你怪闷的，坐在这里作什么？何不出去逛逛呢？”秦氏笑道：“今日可巧：上回宝二叔要见我兄弟，今儿他在这里书房里坐着呢，为什么不瞧瞧去？”宝玉便去要见，尤氏忙吩咐人小心伺候着跟了去。凤姐道：“既这么着，为什么不请进来我也见见呢？”尤氏笑道：“罢，罢，可以不必见。比不得咱们家的孩子，胡打海摔的惯了的。人家的孩子都是斯斯文文的，没见过你这样泼辣货，还叫人家笑话死呢！”凤姐笑道：“我不笑话他就罢了，他敢笑话我？”贾蓉道：“他生的腼腆，没见过大阵仗儿，婶子见了，没的生气。”凤姐啐道：“呸，扯臊！他是哪吒我也要见见。别放你娘的屁了，再不带来，打你顿好嘴巴子。”贾蓉溜湫着眼儿笑道：“何苦婶子又使利害！我们带了来就是了。”凤姐也笑了。\n　　说着出去一会儿，果然带了个后生来：比宝玉略瘦些，眉清目秀，粉面朱唇，身材俊俏，举止风流，似更在宝玉之上，只是怯怯羞羞有些女儿之态，腼腆含糊的向凤姐请安问好。凤姐喜的先推宝玉笑道：“比下去了！”便探身一把攥了这孩子的手，叫他身旁坐下，慢慢问他年纪读书等事，方知他的学名叫秦钟。早有凤姐跟的丫鬟媳妇们，看见凤姐初见秦钟并未备得表礼来，遂忙过那边去告诉平儿。平儿素知凤姐和秦氏厚密，遂自作主意，拿了一匹尺头，两个“状元及第”的小金锞子，交付来人送过去。凤姐还说太简薄些。秦氏等谢毕，一时吃过了饭，尤氏、凤姐、秦氏等抹骨牌，不在话下。\n　　宝玉、秦钟二人随便起坐说话儿。那宝玉自一见秦钟，心中便如有所失，痴了半日，自己心中又起了个呆想，乃自思道：“天下竟有这等的人物！如今看了，我竟成了泥猪癞狗了。可恨我为什么生在这侯门公府之家？要也生在寒儒薄宦的家里，早得和他交接，也不枉生了一世。我虽比他尊贵，但绫锦纱罗，也不过裹了我这枯株朽木；羊羔美酒，也不过填了我这粪窟泥沟。‘富贵’二字，真真把人荼毒了。”那秦钟见了宝玉，形容出众，举止不凡，更兼金冠绣服，艳婢娇童，“果然怨不得姐姐素日提起来就夸不绝口。我偏偏生于清寒之家，怎能和他交接亲厚一番，也是缘法。”二人一样胡思乱想。宝玉又问他读什么书，秦钟见问，便依实而答。二人你言我语，十来句话，越觉亲密起来了。一时捧上茶果吃茶，宝玉便说：“我们两个又不吃酒，把果子摆在里间小炕上，我们那里去，省了闹的你们不安。”于是二人进里间来吃茶。秦氏一面张罗凤姐吃果酒，一面忙进来嘱咐宝玉道：“宝二叔，你侄儿年轻，倘或说不防头，你千万看着我，别理他。他虽腼腆，却脾气拐孤，不大随和儿。”宝玉笑道：“你去罢，我知道了。”秦氏又嘱咐了他兄弟一回，方去陪凤姐儿去了。\n　　一时凤姐尤氏又打发人来问宝玉：“要吃什么，只管要去。”宝玉只答应着，也无心在饮食上，只问秦钟近日家务等事。秦钟因言：“业师于去岁辞馆，家父年纪老了，残疾在身，公务繁冗，因此尚未议及延师，目下不过在家温习旧课而已。再，读书一事，也必须有一二知己为伴，时常大家讨论才能有些进益。”宝玉不待说完，便道：“正是呢！我们家却有个家塾，合族中有不能延师的便可入塾读书，亲戚子弟可以附读。我因上年业师回家去了，也现荒废着。家父之意亦欲暂送我去，且温习着旧书，待明年业师上来，再各自在家读书。家祖母因说，一则家里子弟太多．恐怕大家淘气，反不好；二则也因我病了几天，遂暂且耽搁着。如此说来，尊翁如今也为此事悬心，今日回去，何不禀明，就在我们这敝塾中来，我也相伴，彼此有益，岂不是好事！”秦钟笑道：“家父前日在家提起延师一事，也曾提起这里的义学倒好，原要来和这里的老爷商议引荐，因这里又有事忙，不便为这点小事来絮聒。二叔果然度量侄儿或可磨墨洗砚，何不速速作成，彼此不致荒废，既可以常相聚谈，又可以慰父母之心，又可以得朋友之乐，岂不是美事？”宝玉道：“放心，放心！咱们回来告诉你姐夫姐姐和琏二嫂子，今日你就回家禀明令尊，我回去禀明了祖母，再无不速成之理。”\n　　二人计议已定，那天气已是掌灯时分，出来又看他们玩了一回牌。算账时，却又是秦氏、尤氏二人输了戏酒的东道，言定后日吃这东道，一面又吃了晚饭。因天黑了，尤氏说：“派两个小子送了秦哥儿家去。”媳妇们传出去半日。秦钟告辞起身，尤氏问：“派谁送去？”媳妇们回说：“外头派了焦大，谁知焦大醉了，又骂呢。”尤氏、秦氏都道：“偏又派出他作什么？那个小子派不得？偏又惹他！”凤姐道：“成日家说你太软弱了，纵的家里人这样，还了得吗？”尤氏道：“你难道不知这焦大的？连老爷都不理他，你珍大哥哥也不理他。因他从小儿跟着太爷出过三四回兵，从死人堆里把太爷背出来了，才得了命；自己挨着饿，却偷了东西给主子吃；两日没水，得了半碗水，给主子喝，他自己喝马溺。不过仗着这些功劳情分，有祖宗时，都另眼相待，如今谁肯难为他？他自己又老了，又不顾体面，一味的好酒，喝醉了无人不骂。我常说给管事的，以后不用派他差使，只当他是个死的就完了。今儿又派了他！”风姐道：“我何曾不知这焦大？到底是你们没主意，何不远远的打发他到庄子上去就完了！”说着，因问：“我们的车可齐备了？”众媳妇们说：“伺候齐了。”\n　　凤姐也起身告辞，和宝玉携手同行。尤氏等送至大厅前，见灯火辉煌，众小厮都在丹墀侍立。那焦大又恃贾珍不在家，因趁着酒兴，先骂大总管赖二，说他：“不公道，欺软怕硬，有好差使派了别人，这样黑更半夜送人就派我，没良心的忘八羔子，瞎充管家！你也不想想，焦大太爷翘起一只腿，比你的头还高些。二十年头里的焦大太爷眼里有谁？别说你们这一把子的杂种们！”正骂得兴头上，贾蓉送凤姐的车出来。众人喝他不住，贾蓉忍不住便骂了几句，叫人：“捆起来！等明日酒醒了，再问他还寻死不寻死！”那焦大那里有贾蓉在眼里？反大叫起来，赶着贾蓉叫：“蓉哥儿，你别在焦大跟前使主子性儿！别说你这样儿的，就是你爹、你爷爷，也不敢和焦大挺腰子呢。不是焦大一个人，你们作官儿，享荣华，受富贵！你祖宗九死一生挣下这个家业，到如今不报我的恩，反和我充起主子来了。不和我说别的还可，再说别的，咱们‘红刀子进去，白刀子出来’！”凤姐在车上和贾蓉说：“还不早些打发了没王法的东西！留在家里，岂不是害？亲友知道，岂不笑话咱们这样的人家，连个规矩都没有？”贾蓉答应了“是”。\n　　众人见他太撒野，只得上来了几个，揪翻捆倒，拖往马圈里去。焦大益发连贾珍都说出来，乱嚷乱叫，说：“要往祠堂里哭太爷去，那里承望到如今生下这些畜生来！每日偷狗戏鸡，爬灰的爬灰，养小叔子的养小叔子，我什么不知道？咱们‘胳膊折了往袖子里藏’！”众小厮见他说出来的话有天没日的，唬得魂飞魄丧，把他捆起来，用土和马粪满满的填了他一嘴。凤姐和贾蓉也遥遥的听见了，都装作没听见。宝玉在车上听见，因问凤姐道：“姐姐，你听他说‘爬灰的爬灰’，这是什么话？”凤姐连忙喝道：“少胡说！那是醉汉嘴里胡，你是什么样的人，不说没听见，还倒细问！等我回了太太，看是捶你不捶你！”吓得宝玉连忙央告：“好姐姐，我再不敢说这些话了。”凤姐哄他道：“好兄弟，这才是呢。等回去咱们回了老太太，打发人到家学里去说明了，请秦钟学里念书去要紧。”说着自回荣府而来。\n    要知端的，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After seeing Granny Liu off, Zhou Rui’s wife went to report to Lady Wang but found her no longer in her main apartments. The maids there told her she had gone to her sister-in-law’s place; so Zhou Rui’s wife went through the east side gate to Pear Fragrance Court.\n\nAs she reached the gate of the court, she found Lady Wang’s maid Jinchuan playing on the steps with a young girl who was just letting her hair grow.\n\n“Her Ladyship is in there,” Jinchuan whispered with a jerk of her head as soon as she saw who it was.\n\nZhou Rui’s wife softly raised the portiere and went in. She found Lady Wang and her sister deep in conversation, and not liking to intrude she passed through the inner door into another room where Xue Baochai in home clothes, her hair done up loosely, was copying a flower pattern with her maid Yinger. Putting down her brush, Baochai turned with a smile.\n\n“Do sit down, sister Zhou,” she said.\n\n“How are you, miss?” asked Zhou Rui’s wife, returning her smile as she sat on the edge of the kang. “Why is it you haven’t been over for the last couple of days? I hope young Master Bao hasn’t been annoying you.”\n\n“What an idea!” Baochai laughed. “It’s just that my old complaint has been troubling me again, so I’ve been resting quietly for a day or two.”\n\n“That’s right, miss. But what is this trouble of yours? You ought to have a doctor to see you and get to the root of it. It’s no joke for a young person like you to be left with a chronic complaint.”\n\n“Don’t speak of it!” cried Baochai. “No one knows how many doctors I’ve consulted or how much medicine I’ve taken, but it’s been no use at all. In the end, luckily, we met a monk who cures odd diseases. He said this is a hot poison I brought from the womb. Luckily I have a strong constitution or it would have been more serious. Ordinary medicine is no good. He gave me some exotic prescription as well as a packet of powder for a starter. He said if it comes on, I should take one pill and I’d be all right. And strangely enough, it does help.”\n\n“What is this prescription, miss? If you’d tell me, we could remember it and pass it on to others. It would be a kindness to anyone with the same trouble.”\n\n“Don’t ask. To get this prescription is a fearful business. It doesn’t call for anything special — just the stamens of white peonies in spring, white lotus in summer, white hibiscus in autumn and white plum-blossom in winter, twelve ounces of each. These must be dried in the sun on the vernal equinox of the following year and mixed with the powder. Then you must take twelve drams of rain which fell on the day Rain Begins....”\n\n“Gracious Buddha!” exclaimed Zhou Rui’s wife. “That would take three years. And what if it doesn’t rain on that day?”\n\n“Exactly. You may have to wait. Then you need twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew, twelve drams of frost on Frost Descent, and twelve drams of snow on Slight Snow. You mix these, add honey and pills the size of longans. Keep the pills in an old porcelain jar and bury them beneath the roots of some flowers. When the illness strikes, take one out and take it with twelve candareens of phellodendron decocted in water.”\n\n“Amitabha!” cried the other. “You’d be lucky to get all those in ten years.”\n\n“It was lucky. Some time after the monk left, within a couple of years we had all those things and managed to make up the pills. We brought them from the south and they’re buried now under a pear-tree.”\n\nZhou Rui’s wife asked, “And has the medicine a name or not?”\n\n“Yes. The monk told us that, too. It’s called Cold Fragrance Pills.”\n\n“What are these attacks like when they come on?”\n\n“Nothing much — just asthma and a little coughing. One pill is enough to stop it.”\n\nAs they were speaking, Lady Wang’s voice was heard. “Who’s in there?”\n\nZhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to answer and explain what Granny Liu wanted. After a short pause, having no further instructions, she was about to withdraw when Aunt Xue smiled.\n\n“Wait a minute. I’ve something for you to take.” She called, “Xiangling!”\n\nThe curtain swished as the maid who had been playing with Jinchuan came in.\n\n“What is it, madam?”\n\n“Bring me that box of flowers.”\n\nXiangling assented and fetched a brocade box.\n\n“These are twelve sprays of gauze flowers made in the Palace,” said Aunt Xue. “I thought yesterday it was a pity to leave them tucked away until they get old. Why not give them to the girls to wear? I meant to send them over yesterday but forgot. This is a good time for you to take them. Give two apiece to the three young ladies in your house; and of the six left, give a couple to Miss Lin and the other four to Xifeng.”\n\n“It’s kind of you to think of them,” said Lady Wang. “But why not keep them for Baochai?”\n\n“You don’t realize, madam, the funny ways my daughter has. She never cares for trinkets of that kind.”\n\nSo Zhou Rui’s wife took the box and went out. She found Jinchuan sunning herself outside.\n\n“Is that Xiangling the little maid they’re always talking about?” she asked. “The one there was all that trouble over when you bought her just before coming to the capital?”\n\n“That’s her.”\n\nAs they were speaking Xiangling came up smiling. Zhou Rui’s wife took her hand and looked her over carefully.\n\n“She’s a pretty little thing,” she remarked to Jinchuan. “She takes after Master Rong’s wife in your East Mansion.”\n\n“That’s what I say,” agreed Jinchuan.\n\nThen Zhou Rui’s wife asked Xiangling, “How old were you when you came here? Where are your parents? How old are you now? What parts do you come from?”\n\nTo all of which Xiangling simply shook her head and answered, “I don’t remember.”\n\nZhou Rui’s wife and Jinchuan were quite overcome.\n\nThen the former went with the flowers to the back of Lady Wang’s main apartment. Recently the Lady Dowager had complained that it was too inconvenient having so many young girls crowded together, and so she had kept only Baoyu and Daiyu with her for company, while Yingchun, Tanchun and Xichun had moved to three rooms in an annex behind Lady Wang’s quarters, where Li Wan saw to their needs. Zhou Rui’s wife therefore went first to this annex. The young maids there, who were playing in the verandah, motioned to her not to make a noise as their mistresses were having a nap. Zhou Rui’s wife then tiptoed into the nurse’s room and found her dozing with her baby in her arms. She pointed to the inner room and Zhou Rui’s wife looked in. Yingchun and Tanchun were playing draughts by the window. They rose to their feet when they saw who it was, and asked her to take a seat.\n\n“Don’t let me disturb you, young ladies,” she said. “I’ve just come with some flowers for you from my mistress.”\n\nShe opened the box and took out the flowers, then explained that Aunt Xue had sent them. The two girls told their maids to accept them with thanks.\n\n“Why isn’t Fourth Sister in her room?” asked Zhou Rui’s wife.\n\n“Isn’t that her in there?” the maids asked.\n\nSo Zhou Rui’s wife went into the next room and found Xichun chatting with the novice Zhi Neng from the Water Moon Convent.\n\nAs Xichun was playing with Sapientia, she asked Mrs. Zhou what her business was. The latter opened the box and explained.\n\nXichun smiled.\n\n“I was just saying to Sapientia, I’ve a good mind to shave my head and become a nun too. How lucky that you’ve brought these flowers. If my head were shaved, where could I wear them?”\n\nThis set them all laughing. Xichun told her maids to put the flowers away.\n\n“When did you come?” Mrs. Zhou asked Sapientia. “Where has that bald old bitch of an abbess of yours gone?”\n\n“We came first thing this morning. My mistress called on Her Ladyship, then went to Mr. Yu’s house. She told me to wait for her here.”\n\n“Did you get your monthly allowance and incense money on the fifteenth?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nXichun asked Mrs. Zhou, “Who’s in charge of the monthly allowances to the different temples now?”\n\n“Yu Xin.”\n\n“That explains it.” Xichun chuckled. “As soon as the abbess arrived, Yu Xin’s wife hurried over and had a long, long whispered conversation with her. I’ve no doubt it was about that.”\n\nAfter gossiping a little longer with Sapientia, Mrs. Zhou went on to Xifeng’s apartments. She cut through the passage behind Li Wan’s back window, then west through the break in the wall to the side gate leading into Xifeng’s compound. As she entered the main hall, Feng’er — Xifeng’s little maid — sitting on the doorstep of the inner room, signed to her with a wave to go into the east room. Taking the hint, Mrs. Zhou went softly in and found the nurse patting Jie’er to sleep.\n\n“Is Madam Lian having her nap?” she whispered. “It’s time she was up.”\n\nThe nurse pursed her lips and shook her head with a smile.\n\nJust then they heard a faint burst of laughter from the next room and the sound of Jia Lian’s voice. A door slammed and Pinger came out with a brass basin which she told a young maid to fill with water.\n\nPinger then walked into the east room. At sight of Mrs. Zhou she asked, “What brings you here again, madam?”\n\nThe latter stood up at once and showed her the box.\n\n“I’ve brought some flowers,” she said.\n\nPinger opened the box and selected four sprays, then disappeared. She was back in a few minutes with two of them and told Caiming to take them to Madam Rong of the other mansion. Then she sent Mrs. Zhou on her way with thanks.\n\nMrs. Zhou went next to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. In the hallway she ran into her own daughter, dressed in her best, who had just come from her husband’s home.\n\n“What brings you here?” asked Mrs. Zhou.\n\n“How have you been keeping, mother?” said her daughter. “I waited and waited for you at home, but you didn’t come. What kept you so busy? I got tired of waiting, so I’ve paid my respects to the old lady and I’m on my way now to see Her Ladyship. Have you still some business to see to? What’s that you’ve got there?”\n\n“Aiya! Today of all days Granny Liu turned up, and I’ve been running around on her account. Then Lady Wang saw me and told me to take these flowers to the young ladies. I haven’t finished yet. You must want me for something.”\n\n“You’ve guessed right, mother. I’ll tell you what it is. The other day my husband drank too much and had a row. Some spiteful people who don’t know how he’s placed have reported him to the court and he’s to be sent back to his native place. So I’ve come to ask your advice. Whom should we get to put in a word for him?”\n\nZhou Rui’s wife was not at all disturbed by this.\n\n“I thought it was something serious,” she said. “Run along home now. I’ll be back as soon as I’ve delivered Miss Lin’s flowers. Her Ladyship and the young mistress are both busy, you know.”\n\nHer daughter went off then, urging, “Do hurry, mother!”\n\n“You silly thing,” chuckled Zhou Rui’s wife. “You’ve never seen trouble, that’s why you’re in such a taking.”\n\nWith that she went on to Daiyu’s rooms.\n\nBut she found Daiyu with Baoyu, amusing themselves by trying to undo a ninelinked puzzle. She came in smiling.\n\n“Miss Lin,” she said, “my mistress sends you these flowers.”\n\n“What flowers?” cried Baoyu. “Let me see them.” He took the case from her.\n\nWhen he saw the two palace gauze flowers, he handed them to Daiyu.\n\nDaiyu glanced at them, then asked Zhou Rui’s wife: “Am I the only one getting these, or have the other girls had some too?”\n\n“All the young ladies have some, miss. These two are for you.”\n\n“I might have known,” Daiyu smiled coldly. “I’d be given what the others didn’t want.”\n\nZhou Rui’s wife made no reply.\n\n“Where have you been, sister Zhou?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“To Her Ladyship. She was with my mistress, so the latter told me to bring these flowers on my way back.”\n\n“What’s Cousin Bacchai doing at home? Why hasn’t she been over for the last few days?”\n\n“She’s not very well.”\n\nAt once Baoyu said to the maids, “Which of you will go to see her? Tell her that Miss Lin and I asked to be remembered to Aunt Xue and her, and find out what’s the matter and what medicine she’s taking. I ought to go myself, but I’ve just got back from school and caught a chill too. I’ll go another time.”\n\nQianxue assented and went off. Then Zhou Rui’s wife left too.\n\nTo explain: Zhou Rui’s son-in-law was Leng Zixing, Jia Yucun’s friend. Having recently got into trouble by selling some antiques, he had sent to ask his mother-in-law to get him out of this fix. Relying on her master’s influence, Zhou Rui’s wife thought this a simple matter and that evening simply asked Xifeng to put in a word for him.\n\nThat evening, after Xifeng had taken off her jewellery, she went to see Lady Wang and report, “I’ve accepted the things sent today by the Zhen family and given our gifts to the servants who brought them to take back on their boat which brings fresh produce at the end of the year.”\n\nLady Wang nodded.\n\n“I’ve prepared the birthday presents for the old Dowager Lady of Lin’an,”continued Xifeng. “Whom would you like to deliver them, madam?”\n\n“Just see which women are free and send four of them. Why ask me?”\n\n“Today Sister-in-law You invited me over for tomorrow. Have I any engagements?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether you have or not. Whenever she’s asked us before, we’ve always gone too. This time she’s only asking you, which shows she really wants to have a chat. You should go to keep her company and not disappoint her.”\n\nXifeng agreed.\n\nBy now Li Wan and the three Jia girls had also come to wish the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang good night, after which they returned to their own rooms.\n\nThe next day after Xifeng had dressed and done her hair, she first asked Lady Wang’s instructions, then went to ask the Lady Dowager’s permission. When Baoyu heard where she was going he wanted to go too, so she had to wait while he changed. Then they drove together to the Ning Mansion.\n\nThey were met at the inner gate by Madam You and her daughter-in-law Qin Keqing, attended by a number of maids and serving-women. Madam You and Xifeng exchanged greetings in their usual bantering way. Then Madam You took Baoyu’s hand and they went into the main reception hall, where he offered his\n\nWith Yu-cun, he went to the main sitting-room, where Qin-shi served tea.\n\n“What have you asked me here for?” demanded Xifeng. “What have you got to offer me? Out with it, quick. I’ve other things to attend to.”\n\nBefore You-shi could reply, some of the women answered laughingly, “If you hadn’t come today, madam, that would have been that. But now that you’re here, you can’t have your own way in everything.”\n\nJust then Jia Rong came in to pay his respects, and Baoyu asked, “Where’s big brother today?”\n\n“He’s gone out of town to inquire after my lord father’s health.”\n\n“You must be feeling bored here all by yourself,” put in You-shi. “Why not go for a stroll?”\n\n“As it happens, uncle Bao was wanting to see my brother the other day,” said Qin-shi with a smile. “He’s in the study now. Why not go and see him?”\n\nBaoyu was eager to do this, but You-shi ordered servants to go with him and see that he came to no harm.\n\n“In that case, why not ask your brother in so that I can have a look at him too?” asked Xifeng.\n\n“Forget it,” said You-shi. “He’s not like the boys in our family who are used to being knocked about. Other people’s children are properly brought up. It’s no joke for a young fellow like that to meet a termagant like you.”\n\n“Call me a termagant?” Xifeng laughed. “I’ve never set eyes on him, yet here I am getting the blame. Well, let me tell you, I’m not afraid of his laughing at me.”\n\n“The child’s shy and not used to company,” said Jia Rong. “If he saw you, aunt, he might annoy you.”\n\n“Fiddlesticks!” she scoffed. “I don’t care if he’s the devil himself. I want to see him. Don’t talk such rubbish. If you don’t bring him here at once, I’ll give you a slap on each cheek.”\n\n“How you do throw your weight about!” Jia Rong chuckled, winking. “All right, I’ll bring him in.”\n\nSoon he came back with a young boy, rather slender than Baoyu but more handsome, with clear-cut features, a fair complexion, red lips, a graceful figure and pleasing manners. There was indeed something girlish about his modesty and shyness as he greeted Xifeng with some trepidation.\n\nIn high delight she nudged Baoyu. “Now he puts you in the shade!” she cried. Leaning forward, she took the boy’s hand, made him sit beside her and plied him with questions as to his age, what he was studying and so forth, learning that his school name was Qin Zhong.\n\nAs Xifeng’s maid and servants had not expected to meet Qin Zhong today, they had brought no gifts; but when they reported this to Pinger she at once took a roll of silk and two small gold ingots, minted in the form of “success in the imperial examinations,” and sent these over. Xifeng, however, apologized for the unworthiness of the gift.\n\nAfter Qin-shi had expressed her thanks, they had a meal. Then You-shi, Xifeng and Qin-shi started a game of dominoes, but we need not describe that.\n\nBaoyu and Qin Zhong, left to themselves, chatted. At sight of Qin Zhong, Baoyu had felt quite eclipsed. He lapsed into a spell of stupefaction, then thought, “Imagine there being such people! Why, compared with him I’m no better than a filthy pig or mangy dog. Why did I have to be born into this noble family? If I were the son of a poor scholar, I might have been able to make friends with him and see him every day. What cruel fate to have been born into this household of all others! Although I’m better off than he in point of wealth and rank, what use are these fine clothes but to cover up my dead wood of a body? What use this rich food, except to gorge a cesspit like me? ‘Riches and rank’ are truly a curse, a pollution.”\n\nFor his part, Qin Zhong was thinking, “No wonder my sister speaks of Baoyu in such glowing terms. Why didn’t I meet him before? If only I’d known someone like him, poor as I am, I shouldn’t have lived in vain. To think that he actually appreciates me too! How true it is that all the world kowtows to wealth and rank, but he’s not like that. . . .”\n\nBoth were regretting their ill fate.\n\n‘What books are you reading?’ Bao-yu inquired; and Qin Zhong told him. And so, by easy stages, from one thing to another, a conversation developed between them which very soon established a feeling of considerable intimacy.\n\nMeanwhile tea had been served, and while they were drinking it, Bao-yu proposed — since neither of them took wine — that they should go inside and take their nuts and dried fruit with them on the kang, where they could sit more comfortably and not be in the way of the ladies. Qin Ke-qing at once protested:\n\n‘But we’ve got Cousin Lian’s wife here and your Cousin Zhen’s wife and Aunt You: surely you don’t want to go off on your own and leave them?’\n\n‘We shan’t be any distance away,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Besides, we don’t drink. It’s much more sensible for us to be in the other room and leave you ladies to enjoy your wine in peace.’\n\n‘Even so,’ said Qin Ke-qing, ‘you mustn’t let him have too much to say for himself. He’s a bit shy, I’m afraid, and not very good at mixing. People sometimes take it the wrong way and think he’s awkward.’\n\n‘Don’t you worry!’ said Bao-yu genially. ‘We shall get along all right.’\n\nHaving seen them into the inner room and got them settled, Qin Ke-qing hurried back to the other room to look after Xi-feng and the rest.\n\nPresently You-shi and Xi-feng also sent someone in to ask if Bao-yu would like anything to eat.\n\n‘We’re quite all right, thanks,’ said Bao-yu. He was far too interested in what Qin Zhong was telling him to think about food. Among other things, Qin Zhong told him that his tutor had resigned his post the previous year, that his father was now an old man and in poor health and so burdened with official duties that he had not yet had time to find a new tutor, and that at present he was just going over old lessons on his own at home.\n\n‘Anyway,’ said Qin Zhong, ‘studying on one’s own is no substitute for having a couple of good friends to read with. You need other people to discuss things with and keep you up to the mark.’\n\n‘Exactly!’ said Bao-yu. ‘That’s just our trouble, too. We have a family school, of course, which any of the clansmen who can’t afford a tutor are allowed to attend, and relations are allowed to attend as well. But the tutor who was teaching me left last year, and as my father is so busy with other things, my own studies have rather been allowed to lapse. Grandmother’s idea was that I should go to the school for the time being and go over my old lessons until we can find another tutor. But she’s been putting it off because she says that with so many boys of all ages gathered together in one place, there is bound to be a lot of trouble and unpleasantness — which is not a very good thing. And then I was ill for a bit, so that put it off even longer. It sounds as though your father is worried about this problem, too. Why don’t you go home this evening and tell him about our school? If you were to ask him, I am sure he would let you come. I could come with you, and we should both benefit. Don’t you think that’s a good idea?’\n\n‘My father was only talking the other day about finding a tutor for me,’ said Qin Zhong. ‘He was very taken with the idea of your family school and was going to talk to your father about it and ask him to help. But with all the official business he has to attend to, he is afraid that your father must be a very busy man, and he didn’t like to trouble him with such a trivial matter. If you really think I am good enough, it would be a wonderful thing if we could get it settled quickly. Then we shouldn’t be wasting our time, we should be able to see each other often, it would set our parents’ minds at rest, and we should have the pleasure of each other’s company. It seems almost too good to be true!’\n\n‘Don’t you worry!’ said Bao-yu. ‘We’ll tell Cousin Lian’s wife and your sister and Cousin Zhen’s wife about it presently. And when you get home this evening, you can talk to your father about it. I’ll have a word with Grandmother as soon as I get back, and I am sure there will be no difficulty.’\n\nBy the time they had finished their plans it was already lighting-up time, and they emerged from the inner room to watch the others playing cards for a while. It turned out that Qin Ke-qing and You-shi had lost the play and the dinner which they would now have to provide. It was agreed that they should be held the day after next, and after this had been settled they all sat down to supper. When it was over, as it was now dark, You-shi suggested that a couple of servants should be told to see Qin Zhong home.\n\nThe women went to transmit this order, and after being gone for some time returned to say that the boys had already been sent.\n\n‘Who did you send?’ said You-shi.\n\n‘We sent Jiao Da,’ said the women. ‘But he’s drunk again, and he’s out there cursing.’\n\nYou-shi and Qin Ke-qing were exasperated.\n\n‘Why choose him?’ they said. ‘Any of the boys would have done. Why choose that awful man? He’s always making trouble.’\n\n‘I’ve told you before,’ said Xi-feng, ‘you’re much too soft with these people. You let them get away with anything. It’s ridiculous!’\n\n‘Surely you know what Jiao Da’s like?’ said You-shi. ‘Even Sir Jing doesn’t take any notice of him, and your Cousin Zhen puts up with him only because of the services he did for Grandfather. He saved Grandfather’s life on three or four different occasions when they were out on campaign together.\n\nHe’d go hungry himself to steal food for his master; he went two days without water to bring back half a bowl for his master, and made do with horse’s urine himself. Because of such services the old master showed him favour, and the rest of us put up with him. But now he’s old and has no sense of propriety. He does nothing but drink, and when he’s drunk he abuses everybody. I’ve often told the stewards not to assign him any duties but to treat him as if he were dead. Yet here he is today given this job again.”\n\n“Don’t I know all about Jiao Da?” retorted Xifeng. “The only thing is to pack him off to some farm a long way away and have done with it.” She asked, “Are my carriages ready?”\n\n“Yes,” answered the women. “They’re waiting.”\n\nXifeng rose to take her leave and went out hand in hand with Baoyu, while Madam You and the others saw them to the main hall. The courtyard was brightly lit with lanterns and the pages on duty were drawn up below the steps. Because Jia Zhen was not at home, Jiao Da was in high feather. He was in the middle of cursing the chief steward Lai Er.\n\n“That unfair, cowardly bully!” he was bellowing. “He gives all the soft jobs to others but sends me on this trip in the middle of the night. The heartless bastard! Putting on the dog and acting like a steward. Don’t you know, young fellow, that when your Grandpa Jiao lifts one leg it’s higher than your head? Twenty years ago I didn’t give a fig for anyone. Don’t think you can impress me, you bunch of young pups.”\n\nJia Rong was seeing Xifeng’s carriage out and, as the servants were unable to silence the drunkard, he lost his temper too.\n\n“Tie him up!” he shouted. “We’ll see tomorrow whether he still wants to die.”\n\nJiao Da was not going to stand for this from Jia Rong. He swaggered up to him.\n\n“Don’t you try lord it over me, young Brother Rong,” he yelled. “Not to speak of the likes of you, even your dad and your granddad don’t dare to stand up to Grandpa Jiao. If it weren’t for me, where would you all be — your official posts, your money, your fine estates? It was your great-granddad who won this family property, and only just in the nick of time. Instead of showing your gratitude, you try to boss it over me. I’ve a good mind to cut your throat, and we’ll see who’s afraid of dying.”\n\nXifeng from her carriage said to Jia Rong, “Why don’t you get rid of this lawless wretch? If he stays, he’ll be the ruin of us. What will our relatives think if they hear of such goings-on? They’ll laugh at a house with no rules.”\n\n“Yes,” agreed Jia Rong.\n\nAs the fellow was making such an uproar, some of the servants overpowered him, tied him up and dragged him to the stable. But he went on shouting about Jia Zhen too.\n\n“I’m going to the ancestral temple to weep for the old master,” he bawled. “Little did he think he’d beget such degenerates, a pack of dogs and bitches in heat, day in and day out scratching in the ashes and carrying on with younger brothers-in-law.”\n\nThe servants were horrified by such crazy talk. They trussed him up and stuffed his mouth with mud and horse-dung.\n\nXifeng and Jia Rong pretended not to have heard. But Baoyu, who was in the carriage, asked his cousin the meaning of the phrase “scratching in the ashes.”\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense!” Xifeng hastily exclaimed. “That’s the filthy talk of drunkards. You’re not to repeat such things. If you do, I shall tell the mistress and she’ll have you beaten.”\n\nThis frightened Baoyu into silence.\n\n“Dear cousin,” he pleaded, “I won’t say it again.”\n\n“That’s a good boy,” she soothed him. “When we get back I’ll send someone to explain to the tutor in the family school.”\n\n\"Tell him to send Qin Zhong to school at once,\" she said, and returned to the Rong Mansion.\n\nTo know what followed, read the next chapter."
