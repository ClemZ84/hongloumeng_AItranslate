  "original": "却说冯紫英去后，贾政叫门上的人来吩咐道：“今儿临安伯那里来请吃酒，知道是什么事？”门上的的人道：“奴才曾问过，并没有什么喜庆事，不过南安王府里到了一班小戏子，都说是个名班，伯爷高兴，唱两天戏请相好的老爷们瞧瞧，热闹热闹。大约不用送礼的。”说着，贾赦过来问道：“明儿二老爷去不去？”贾政遁：“承他亲热，怎么好不去的。”说着，门上进来回道：“衙门里书办来请老爷明日上衙门。有堂派的事，必得早些去。”贾政道：“知道了。”说着，只见两个管屯里地租子的家人走来，请了安磕了头旁边站着。贾政说：“你们是郝家庄的？”两个答应了一声。贾政也不往下问，竟与贾赦各自说了一回话儿散了。\n　　家人等秉着手灯送过贾赦去，这里贾琏便叫那管租的人道：“说你的。”那人说道：“十月里的租子，奴才已经赶上来了。原是明儿可到，谁知京外拿车，把车上的东西不由分说都掀在地下。奴才告诉他，说是府里收租子的车，不是买卖车，他更不管这些。奴才叫车夫只管拉着走，几个衙役就把车夫混打了一顿，硬扯了两辆车去了。奴才所以先来回报。求爷打发个人到衙门里去要了来才好。再者，也整治整治这些无法无天的差役才好。爷还不知道呢：更可怜的是那买卖车，客商的东西全不顾，掀下来赶着就走。那些赶车的但说句话，打的头破血出的。”贾琏听了，骂道：“这个还了得！”立刻写了一个帖儿，叫家人：“拿去向拿车的衙门里要车去，并车上东西，若少了一件是不依的。快叫周瑞。”周瑞不在家，又叫旺儿。旺儿晌午出去了，还没有回来。贾琏道：“这些忘八日的，一个都不在家！他们成年家吃粮不管事！”因吩咐小厮们：“快给我找去！”说着，也回到自己屋里睡下，不提。\n　　且说临安伯第二天又打发人来请。贾政告诉贾赦道：“我是衙门里有事。琏儿要在家等候拿车的事情，也不能去。倒是大老爷带着宝玉应酬一天也罢了。”贾赦点头道：“也使得。”贾政遣人去叫宝玉，说：“今儿跟大爷到临安伯那里听戏去。”宝玉喜欢的了不得，便换上衣服，带了焙茗、扫红、锄药三个小子，出来见了贾赦，请了安，上了车，来到临安伯府里。门上人回进去，一会子出来说：“老爷请。”于是贾赦带着宝玉走入院内，只见宾客喧闻。贾赦宝玉见了临安伯，又与众宾客都见过了礼，大家坐着，说笑了一回。只见一个掌班拿着一本戏单，一个牙笏，向上打了一个千儿，说道：“求各位老爷赏戏。”先从尊位点起，挨至贾赦，也点了一出。那人回头见了宝玉，便不向别处去，竟抢步上来，打个千儿道：“求二爷赏两出。”宝玉一见那人，面如傅粉，唇若涂朱，鲜润如出水芙蕖，飘扬似临风玉树：原来不是别人，就是蒋玉函。前日听得他带了小戏儿进京，也没有到自己那里：此时见了，又不好站起来，只得笑道：“你多早晚来的？”蒋玉函把眼往左右一溜，悄悄的笑道：“怎么二爷不知道么？”宝玉因众人在坐，也难说话，只得乱点了一出。蒋玉函去了，便有几个议论道：“此人是谁？”有的说：“他向来是唱小旦的，如今不肯唱小旦，年纪也大了，就在府里掌班。头里也改过小生。他也攒了好几个钱，家里已经有两三个铺子，只是不肯放下本业，原旧领班。”有的说：“想必成了家了。”有的说：“亲还没有定。他倒拿定一个主意，说是人生婚配关系一生一世的事，不是混闹得的，不论尊卑贵贱，总要配的上他的才能。所以到如今还并没娶亲。”宝玉暗忖度道：“不知日后谁家的女孩儿嫁他？要嫁着这么样的人才儿，也算是不辜负了。”\n　　那时开了戏，也有昆腔，也有高腔，也有弋腔、平腔，热闹非常。到了晌午，便摆开桌子吃酒。又看了一回，贾赦便欲起身。临安伯过来留道：“天色尚早。听见说琪官儿还有一出《占花魁》，他们顶好的首戏。”宝玉听了，巴不得贾赦不走。于是贾赦又坐了一会。果然蒋玉函扮了秦小官，伏侍花魁醉后神情，把那一种怜香惜玉的意思，做得极情尽致。以后对饮对唱，缠绵缱绻。宝玉这时不看花魁，只把两支眼睛独射在秦小官身上。更加蒋玉函声音响亮，口齿清楚，按腔落板，宝玉的神魂都唱的飘荡了。直等这出戏煞场后，更知蒋玉函极是情种，非寻常脚色可比。因想着：“《乐记》上说的是：‘情动于中，故形于声；声成文，谓之音。’所以知声，知音，知乐，有许多讲究。声音之原，不可不察。诗词一道，但能传情。不能入骨，自后想要讲究讲究音律。”宝玉想出了神，忽见贾赦起身，主人不及相留。宝玉没法，只得跟了回来。\n　　到了家中，贾赦自回那边去了。宝玉来见贾政。贾政才下衙门，正向贾琏问起拿车之事。贾琏道：“今儿叫人拿帖儿去，知县不在家。他的门上说了：‘这是本官不知道的，并无牌票出去拿车，都是那些混账东西在外头撒野挤讹头。既是老爷府里的，我便立刻叫人去追办，包管明儿连车连东西一并送来。如有半点差迟，再行禀过本官，重重处治。此刻本官不在家，求这里老爷看破些，可以不用本官知道更好。’”贾政道：“既无官票，到底是何等样人在那里作怪？”贾琏道：“老爷不知，外头都是这样。想来明儿必定送来的。”贾琏说完下来，宝玉上去见了。贾政问了几句，便叫他往老太太那里去。\n　　贾琏因为昨夜叫空了家人，出来传唤，那起人部已伺候齐全。贾琏骂了一顿，叫大管家赖大：“将各行档的花名册子拿来，你去查点查点，写一张谕帖，叫那些人知道。若有并未告假，私自出去，传唤不到，贻误公事的，立刻给我打了撵出去！”赖大连忙答应了几个“是”，出来吩咐了一回，家人各自留意。\n　　过不几时，忽见有一个人，头上戴着毡帽，身上穿着一身青布衣裳，脚下穿着一双撒鞋，走到门上，向众人作了个揖。众人拿眼上上下下打量了他一番，便问他：“是那里来的？”那人道：“我自南边甄府中来的。并有家老爷手书一封，求这里的爷们呈上尊老爷。”众人听见他是甄府来的，才站起来让他坐下，道：“你乏了，且坐坐。我们给你回就是了。”门上一面进来回明贾政，呈上来书。贾政拆书看时，上写道：\n　　世交夙好，气谊紊敦，遥仰帷，不胜依切。弟因菲材获遣，自分万死难偿，幸邀宽宥，待罪边隅。迄今门户雕零，家人星散。所有奴子包勇，向曾使用，虽无奇技，人尚悫实。倘使得备奔走，糊口有资，屋乌之爱，感佩无涯矣！专此奉达，馀容再叙，不宣。年家眷弟甄应嘉顿首。\n　　贾政看完，笑道：“这里正因人多，甄家倒荐人来。又不好却的。”吩咐门上：“叫他见我，且留他住下，因材使用便了。”\n　　门上出去，带进人来，见贾政，便磕了三个头，起来道：“家老爷请老爷安。”自己又打个千儿，说：“包勇请老爷安。”贾政回问了甄老爷的好，便把他上下一瞧。但见包勇身长五尺有零，肩背宽肥，浓眉爆眼，磕额长髯，气色粗黑，垂着手站着。便问道：“你是向来在甄家的，还是住过几年的？”包勇道：“小的向在甄家的。”贾政道：“你如今为什么要出来呢？”包勇道：“小的原不肯出来，只是家老爷再四叫小的出来，说别处你不肯去，这里老爷家里和在咱们自己家里一样的，所以小的来的。”贾政道：“你们老爷不该有这样事情，弄到这个田地。”包勇道：“小的本不敢说：我们老爷只是太好了，一味的真心待人，反倒招出事来。”贾政道：“真心是最好的了。”包勇道：“因为太真了，人人都不喜欢，讨人厌烦是有的。”贾政笑了一笑道：“既这样，皇天自然不负他的。”包勇还要说时，贾政又问道：“我听见说你们家的哥儿不是也叫宝玉么？”包勇道：“是。”贾政道：“他还肯向上巴结么？”包勇道：“老爷若问我们哥儿，倒是一段奇事。哥儿的脾气也和我家老爷一个样子，也是一味的诚实，从小儿只爱和那些姐妹们在一处玩。老爷太太也狠打过几次，他只是不改。那一年太太进京的时候儿，哥儿大病了一场，已经死了半日，把老爷几乎急死，装裹都预备了。幸喜后来好了，嘴里说道：走到一座牌楼那里，见了一个姑娘，领着他到了一座庙里，见了好些柜子，里头见了好些册子。又到屋里，见了无数女子，说是都变了鬼怪似的，也有变做骷髅儿的。他吓急了，就哭喊起来。老爷知他醒过来了，连忙调治，渐渐的好了。老爷仍叫他在姐妹们一处玩去，他竟改了脾气了：好着时候的玩意儿一概都不要了，惟有念书为事。就有什么人来引诱他，他也全不动心。如今渐渐的能够帮着老爷料理些家务了。”贾政默然想了一回，道：“你去歇歇去罢。等这里用着你时，自然派你一个行次儿。”包勇答应着，退下来，跟着这里人出去歇息不提。\n　　一日贾政早起，刚要上衙门，看见门上那些人在那里交头接耳，好象要使贾政知道的似的，又不好明回，只管咕咕唧唧的说话。贾政叫上来问道：“你们有什么事这么鬼鬼祟祟的？”门上的人道：“奴才们不敢说。”贾政道：“有什么事不敢说的？”门上的人道：“奴才今儿起来，开门出去，见门上贴着一张白纸，上写着许多不成事体的字。”贾政：“那里有这样的事！写的是什么？”门上的人道：“是水月庵里的腌话。”贾政道：“拿给我瞧。”门上的人道：“奴才本要揭下来，谁知他贴的结实，揭不下来，只得一面抄，一面洗。刚才李德揭了一张给奴才瞧，就是那门上贴的话。奴才们不敢隐瞒。”说着，呈上那帖儿。贾政接来看时，上面写着：\n　　西贝草斤年纪轻，水月庵里管尼僧。\n　　一个男人多少女，窝娼聚赌是陶情。\n　　不肖子弟来办事，荣国府内好声名。\n　　贾政看了，气的头昏目晕，赶着叫门上的人不许声张，悄悄叫人往宁荣两府靠近的夹道子墙壁上再去找寻。随即叫人去唤贾琏出来。贾琏即忙赶至。贾政忙问道：“水月庵中寄居的那些女尼女道，向来你也查考查考过没有？”贾琏道：“没有，一向都是芹儿在那里照管。”贾政道：“你知道芹儿照管得来照管不来？”贾琏道：“老爷既这么说，想来芹儿必有不妥当的地方儿。”贾政叹道：“你瞧瞧这个帖儿写的是什么！”贾琏一看道：“有这样事么！”正说着，只见贾蓉走来，拿着一封书子，写着“二老爷密启”。打开看时，也是无头榜一张，与门上所贴的话相同。贾政道：“快叫赖大带了三四辆车到水月庵里去，把那些女尼姑女道长一齐拉回来。不许泄漏，只说里头传唤。”赖大领命去了。\n　　且说水月庵中小女尼女道士等，初到庵中，沙弥与道士原系老尼收管，日间教他些经忏。以后元妃不用，也便习学得懒惰了。那些女孩子们年纪渐渐的大了，都也有些知觉了。更兼贾芹也是风流人物，打量芳官等出家，只是小孩子性儿，便去招惹他们。那知芳官竟是真心，不能上手，便把这心肠移到女尼女道士身上。因那小沙弥中有个名叫沁香的，和女道士中有个叫做鹤仙的，长的都甚妖娆，贾芹便和这两个人勾搭上了，闲时便学些丝弦，唱个曲儿。\n　　那时正当十月中旬，贾芹给庵中那些人领了月例银子，便想起法儿来，告诉众人道：“我为你们领月钱，不能进城，又只得在这里歇着，怪冷的。怎么样？我今儿带些果子酒，大家吃着乐一夜好不好？”那些女孩子都高兴，便摆起桌子，连本庵的女尼也叫了来。惟有芳官不来。贾芹喝了几杯，便说道要行令。沁香等道：“我们都不会，倒不如拳罢。谁输了喝一钟，岂不爽快？”本庵的女尼道：“这天刚过晌午，混嚷混喝的不象，且先喝几钟，爱散的先散去。谁爱陪芹大爷的，回来晚上尽子喝去，我也不管。”正说着，只见道婆急忙进来说：“快散了罢！府里赖大爷来了。”众女尼忙乱收拾，便叫贾芹躲开。贾芹因多喝了几杯，便道：“我是送月钱来的，怕什么？”话犹未完，已见赖大进来，见这般样子，心里大怒。为的是贾政吩咐不许声张，只得含糊装笑道：“芹大爷也在这里呢么？”贾芹连忙站起来道：“赖大爷，你来作什么？”赖大说：“大爷在这里更好。快快叫沙弥道士收拾上车进城，宫里传呢。”贾芹等不知原故，还要细问。赖大说：“天已不早了，快快的好赶进城。”众女孩子只得一齐上车。赖大骑着大走骡，押着赶进城，不提。\n　　却说贾政知道这事，气的衙门也不能上了，独坐在内书房叹气。贾琏也不敢走开。忽见门上的进来禀道：“衙门里今夜该班是张老爷。因张老爷病了，有知会来请老爷补一班。”贾政正等赖大回来要办贾芹，此时又要该班，心里纳闷，也不言语。贾琏走上去说道：“赖大是饭后出去的，水月庵离城二十来里，就赶进城也得二更天。今日又是老爷的帮班，请老爷只管去。赖大来了，叫他押着，也别声张，等明儿老爷回来再发落。倘或芹儿来了，也不用说明，看他明儿见了老爷怎么样说。”贾政听来有理，只得上班去了。贾琏抽空才要回到自己房中，一面走着，心里抱怨凤姐出的主意，欲要埋怨，因他病着，只得隐忍，慢慢的走着。\n　　且说那些下人，一人传十，传到里头，先是平儿知道，即忙告诉凤姐。凤姐因那一夜不好，恹恹的总没精神，正是惦记铁槛寺的事情。听见“外头贴了匿名揭帖”的一句话，吓了一跳，忙问：“贴的是什么？”平儿随口答应，不留神，就错说了，道：“没要紧，是馒头庵里的事情。”凤姐本是心虚，听见“馒头庵的事情”，这一唬直唬怔了，一句话没说出来，急火上攻，眼前发晕，咳嗽了一阵便歪倒了，两眼却只是发怔。平儿慌了，说道：“水月庵里，不过是女沙弥女道士的事，奶奶着什么急呢？”凤姐听是水月庵才定了定神，道：“嗳！糊涂东西！到底是水月庵，是馒头庵呢？”平儿道：“是我头里错听了馒头庵，后来听见不是馒头庵，是水月庵。我刚才也就说溜了嘴，说成馒头庵了。”凤姐道：“我就知道是水月庵。那馒头庵与我什么相干。原是这水月庵是我叫芹儿管的，大约刻扣了月钱。”平儿道：“我听着不象月钱的事，还有些腌话呢。”凤姐道：“我更不管那个。你二爷那里去了？”平儿说：“听见老爷生气，他不敢走开。我听见事情不好，我吩咐这些人不许吵嚷，不知太太们知道了没有。就听见说，老爷叫赖大拿这些女孩子去了。且叫人前头打听打听。奶奶现在病着，依我竟先别管他们的闲事。”正说着，只见贾琏进来。凤姐欲待问他，见贾琏一脸怒气，暂且装作不知。贾琏没吃完饭，旺儿来说：“外头请爷呢，赖大回来了。”贾琏道：“芹儿来了没有？”旺儿道：“也来了。”贾琏便道：“你告诉赖大说：老爷上班儿去了，把这些个女孩子暂且收在园里，明日等老爷回来，送进宫去。只叫芹儿在内书房等着我。”旺儿去了。\n　　贾芹走进书房，只见那些下人指指戳戳不知说什么，看起这个样儿来，不象宫里要人。想着问人，又问不出来。正在心里疑惑，只见贾琏走出来，贾芹便请了安，垂手侍立，说道：“不知道娘娘宫里即刻传那些女孩子们做什么？叫侄儿好赶。幸喜侄儿今儿送月钱去，还没有走，便同着赖大来了。二叔想来是知道的。”贾琏道：“我知道什么？你才是明白的呢！”贾芹摸不着头脑儿，也不敢再问。贾琏道：“你干的好事啊！把老爷都气坏了！”贾芹道：“侄儿没有干什么。庵里月钱是月月给的，孩子们经忏是不忘的。”贾琏见他不知，又是平素常在一处玩笑的，便叹口气道：“打嘴的东西，你各自去瞧瞧罢。”便从靴掖儿里头拿出那个揭帖来，扔与他瞧。贾芹拾来一看，吓得面如土色，说道：“这是谁干的！我并没得罪人，为什么这么坑我？我一月送钱去，只走一趟，并没有这些事。若是老爷回来，打着问我，侄儿就屈死了！我母亲知道，更要打死。”说着，见没人在旁边，便跪下央及道：“好叔叔，救我一救儿罢！”说罢，只管磕头，满眼流泪。贾琏想道：“老爷最恼这些，要是问准了有这些事，这场气也不小，闹出去也不好听。又长那个贴帖儿的人的志气了，将来咱们的事多着呢。倒不如趁着老爷上班儿，和赖大商量背，要混过去，就可以没事了。现在没有对证。”想定主意，便说：“你别瞒我。你干的鬼儿，你打量我都不知道呢。若要完事，除非是老爷打着问你，你只一口咬定没有才好。没脸的东西！起去罢！”叫人去叫赖大。不多时，赖大来了，贾琏便和他商量。赖大说：“这芹大爷本来闹的不象了。奴才今儿到庵里的时候，他们正在那里喝酒呢。帖儿上的话一定是有的。”贾琏道：“芹儿，你听！赖大还赖你不成？”贾芹此时红涨了脸，一句也不敢言语。还是贾琏拉着赖大，央他：“护庇护庇罢，只说芹哥儿是在家里找了来的。你带了他去，只说没有见我。明日你求老爷，也不用问那些女孩子了，竟是叫了媒人来，领了去，一卖完事。果然娘娘再要的时候儿，咱们再买。”赖大想来，闹也无益，且名声不好，也就应了。贾琏叫贾芹：“跟了赖大爷去罢！听着他教你，你就跟着他。”说罢，贾芹又磕了一个头，跟着赖大出去。到了没人的地方儿，又给赖大磕头。赖大说：“我的小爷，你太闹的不象了。不知得罪了谁，闹出这个乱儿来，你想想，谁和你不对罢？”贾芹想了一会子，并无不对的人，只得无精打彩，跟着赖大走回。\n未知如何抵赖，且听下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Feng Ziying’s departure, Jia Zheng summoned the gateman and asked, “What is the occasion for the invitation today from the Lord of Linan?”\n\n“I asked that, sir,” was the reply. “There’s no special celebration, but the Prince of Nanan has a new opera troupe which is said to be very good. His Lordship is so pleased that he’s giving performances for two days to entertain his friends. I don’t think any presents are expected.”\n\nJust then Jia She joined them and asked, “Are you going tomorrow, brother?”\n\n“Since he’s invited me so cordially, of course I must,” said Jia Zheng.\n\nThe gateman came in again to announce, “A clerk from your yamen is here, sir, to ask you to go there early tomorrow morning because there’s some business to attend to.”\n\n“Very well,” said Jia Zheng.\n\nTwo stewards in charge of land rents now arrived. Having paid their respects they stood waiting.\n\nJia Zheng asked, “Are you from Hao Village?”\n\nWhen they assented, without further questioning he chatted for a while with Jia She before they separated.\n\nServants with hand-lanterns saw Jia She out, and then Jia Lian ordered the rent-stewards, “Let’s hear your report.”\n\nOne of them said, “We’ve brought the rent for October, sir. We should have got here tomorrow, but outside the city they commandeered our carts and threw our goods down on the road without so much as a ‘by your leave.’ When I told them these were the Rong Mansion’s rent-carts, not traders’ carts, they paid no attention. I told the carters to drive on, but some constables set on them and beat them up, then impounded two of the carts. That’s why I’ve come to report this. I hope you will send someone to the yamen to get them back. And those lawless constables should be taught a lesson. You’ve no idea, sir: it’s even worse for traders. They throw the merchants’ goods down and drive off with their carts. If the carters say a word, they beat them black and blue.”\n\n“Outrageous!” fumed Jia Lian.\n\nHe at once wrote a note and ordered a servant, “Take this to the yamen that seized the carts and demand their return with all the goods. I’ll hold them responsible if so much as one thing is missing. Fetch Zhou Rui!”\n\nZhou Rui was not at home. He sent for Wang’er, but Wang’er had gone out at noon and not come back yet.\n\n“The bastards are never here when they’re needed!” swore Jia Lian. “They draw their pay all the year round but never do their duty.”\n\nHe ordered some pages, “Find them for me, quick!” With that he went to his own room to sleep, and there we can leave him.\n\nThe next day the Lord of Linan sent another invitation. Jia Zheng told Jia She, “I have business in the yamen, and Lian is waiting for news of those carts, so he can’t go either. Why don’t you take Baoyu to represent our family?”\n\nJia She agreed, “Very well.”\n\nJia Zheng sent to tell Baoyu, “Today you are to go with your uncle to the Lord of Linan’s to watch the operas.”\n\nBaoyu was overjoyed. He changed his clothes and went out with Beiming, Saohong and Chuyao to pay his respects to Jia She. Then they mounted their carriages and drove to the Linan Mansion. The gateman announced their arrival and came out after a while to invite them in. Jia She and Baoyu walked into the courtyard, which was filled with a noisy throng of guests. They greeted their host and all the others, then sat down to chat.\n\nPresently the manager of the opera troupe came in, holding a play-list and an ivory tablet. He knelt on one knee and said, “Will the gentlemen please choose the items to be performed?”\n\nStarting from the most senior guest, he made the rounds till he came to Jia She who also made a choice. Then the manager caught sight of Baoyu and, instead of proceeding further, hurried over to him and dropped one knee.\n\nJinger made a request: “Will you choose two items for us, Master Bao?”\n\nBaoyu saw that the man had a face as if powdered, lips as if rouged, and was as fresh as a lotus rising from the water or a jade tree swaying in the breeze. It was none other than Jiang Yuhan. He had heard the day before that Jiang had come to the capital with his company but had not called on him; however, with so many people present he could not stand up to greet him.\n\nHe simply asked with a smile, “When did you arrive?”\n\nJiang shot a glance right and left, then whispered, “So you didn’t know, sir?”\n\nBaoyu found it awkward to talk with so many people there and at random chose one item.\n\nAfter Jiang Yuhan had left, some of those present asked, “Who is that?”\n\nOne informed them, “He used to play female roles, but now he’s too old for that and is the manager of a troupe here. For a time he switched to young male roles. He’s saved quite a bit of money and owns two or three shops, but he won’t give up the stage and is still a manager.”\n\n“I suppose he’s married,” said another.\n\n“No, not yet. He’s made up his mind that, since marriage is a lifelong business, it’s not to be trifled with. He’s determined to marry someone worthy of him, no matter whether her family is high or low. So he’s still a bachelor.”\n\nBaoyu thought, “I wonder whose daughter will marry him. She won’t be unworthy of him, I’m sure, if she’s as talented as he is.”\n\nThen the performance started. There were items from the Kunju, Gaoqiao, Yiyang and Pingju operas, making a fine variety. At noon, tables were laid for a feast, and after more opera the Duke of Linan pressed Jia She to stay longer when he made a move to leave.\n\n“It’s still early,” he said. “I hear that Jade Boy is going to sing The Flower Queen, one of their best items.”\n\nBaoyu was eager for his uncle to stay, and so Jia She remained. Sure enough, Jiang Yuhan came on as the young scholar Qin, waiting on the Flower Queen in her cups, and he conveyed most vividly the young man’s tenderness for fragrant jade. Then, as they sang of drinking together, their love was most moving. By now Baoyu had eyes only for the young scholar, not for the Flower Queen. And Jiang Yuhan’s voice was so resonant, his articulation so clear, his melody and rhythm so perfect, that Baoyu was utterly carried away. Not till the end of the act did he realize that Jiang was a romantic lover such as few could equal. He reflected, “As is written in The Book of Music, ‘When an emotion is stirred, it takes form in sound, and when sounds are combined they form a melody.’ So there is a whole art in the knowledge of sound, melody and music. The origin of music should be studied. Poetry can convey emotion but not so penetratingly. I must look more carefully into the laws of music.”\n\nHis reverie was cut short by Jia She’s departure, as their host was unable to detain him longer. Baoyu had to follow his uncle home.\n\nUpon their return, Jia She went to his own quarters and Baoyu called on his father, who had just come back from his yamen and was questioning Jia Lian about the seizure of the carriage.\n\n“I sent a man today with my card,” said Jia Lian, “but the magistrate was out. His gateman told us, ‘This was done without the magistrate’s knowledge. No warrant was issued to seize any carriage — it was just some scoundrels outside making trouble. As this carriage belongs to your mansion, we shall have it sent back first thing tomorrow with all the things in it. If there’s the least delay, we’ll report it to the magistrate and have the culprits severely punished. His Honour isn’t at home now, so we hope your master will overlook this. It would be better not to inform the magistrate.’”\n\nJia Zheng asked, “If no warrant was issued, who are these scoundrels?”\n\n“You don’t understand, sir, such things are common outside. I’m sure the carriage will be returned tomorrow.”\n\nHaving reported this Jia Lian withdrew.\n\nBaoyu went in to see his father, who after a few brief questions sent him to the Lady Dowager.\n\nJia Lian had summoned the servants the previous night to no avail; but now when he came out to issue orders, all the servants were assembled there. He swore at them and ordered the chief steward Lai Da:\n\n\"Bring the registers of the different households and check them. Then write a notice to let them all know that any man who stays away when sent for without having asked for leave, and so holds up business, is to be given a good beating and thrown out at once.\"\n\nLai Da assented repeatedly and went out to pass on these orders, warning the servants to be more careful.\n\nPresently a man in a felt hat, dark cotton clothes and cloth shoes stepped up to the gate and bowed to the gatemen. They eyed him up and down.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" they asked.\n\n\"From the Zhen family in the south,\" he answered. \"I have a letter from my master to be delivered to your master.\"\n\nHearing that he came from the Zhens, they stood up and offered him a seat.\n\n\"You must be tired,\" they said. \"Sit down while we report your arrival.\"\n\nOne of them went in to report to Jia Zheng and present the letter. Jia Zheng opened it and read:\n\nThe friendship between our two families and my profound respect for Your Excellency make me long to be able to look up to you. Being a man of limited talents I have incurred the Emperor's displeasure and, though I know my life is forfeit, I have been leniently treated and exiled to this distant region. Now my house is deserted and my servants have scattered. I have a servant, Bao Yong, whom I employed in the past. Though he has no outstanding skill, he is thoroughly honest. If you can find him some employment so that he can keep body and soul together, I shall be eternally grateful for this kindness to one connected with me. This is the purpose of my letter. Further details will have to wait till we meet again.\n\nYour kinsman,\n\nZhen Yingjia\n\nJia Zheng said with a smile, \"Here we are complaining that we have too many people, and now the Zhens recommend someone to us. Still, we can't refuse.\" He ordered the gateman, \"Bring him in to see me, then find him somewhere to stay. We can use him according to his abilities.\"\n\nThe gateman went out and brought Bao Yong in. Having kotowed to Jia Zheng, the man rose to his feet and said, \"My master presents his compliments.\" Then he dropped one knee in a salute and announced, \"Bao Yong pays his respects.\"\n\nAfter inquiring after Zhen Yingjia, Jia Zheng looked the servant over. He was a stalwart, swarthy fellow over five feet tall, with a broad back, bushy eyebrows and protruding eyes, a receding hair-line and a long beard. Standing there respectfully with his arms at his sides, he looked a simple, honest sort.\n\nJia Zheng asked, \"Have you always served in the Zhen household? How many years were you with them?\"\n\n\"I've always been with them, sir.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to leave now?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to, sir, but the master insisted. He said, I wouldn't go anywhere else, but the Jia family are the same as our own. That's why I've come.\"\n\n\"Your master shouldn't have got into such trouble and come to such a pass.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't say this, but our master was too good. His sincerity towards people landed him in trouble.\"\n\n\"Sincerity is the best thing.\"\n\n\"Because he was too sincere, everybody disliked him and found him a nuisance.\"\n\nJia Zheng smiled. \"In that case, Heaven is bound to show him favour.\"\n\nAs Bao Yong was about to say more, Jia Zheng asked, \"I hear your young master's name is Baoyu too, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Is he making good progress?\"\n\n\"If you ask about our young master, sir, that's a strange story. He has the same temperament as our master -- just as sincere. Since he was a boy he's liked the company of\n\nThe girls played together, and though the master and mistress had often beaten him severely he wouldn’t reform. That year when the mistress went to the capital, he had a bad illness and was dead for half a day — the master was frantic and had his shroud all prepared. Luckily he came back to life, and said that he had come to an archway where a girl took him to a temple in which were many cupboards full of registers. Then he went into a hall and saw countless girls who turned into devils or skeletons, and he was so terrified he started crying out. When the master knew he had come round, he had him treated and he gradually recovered. After that, the master still let him play with the girls, but he changed completely: he lost all interest in his old toys and just cared about study. No matter who tried to tempt him, he wasn’t swayed. And now, little by little, he’s able to help the master manage the household.”\n\nJia Zheng reflected on this for a while, then said, “Go and rest now. When we need you here, we’ll assign you a job.”\n\nBao Yong assented and withdrew to rest with the other servants.\n\nJia Zheng rose early one morning and was about to leave for his yamen when he saw the gatemen whispering together with their heads close as if they wanted him to know something but were afraid to report it, simply muttering together. He called them over and asked, “What are you up to, sneaking around like that?”\n\n“We don’t like to tell you, sir,” they said.\n\n“What is it you daren’t say?”\n\n“This morning when we opened the gate we saw a sheet of white paper stuck on it covered with shocking writing.”\n\n“How outrageous! What does it say?”\n\n“Slander about the Convent of the Moon in the Water, sir.”\n\n“Let me see it.”\n\n“We tried to take it down but it was stuck fast and we couldn’t; so we had to copy it out while washing it off. One of the gatemen, Li De, has just shown me another one like it. We didn’t dare hide this from you, sir.” With that they handed him the paper.\n\nJia Zheng read:\n\nYoung as he is, Jia Qin’s in charge\n\nOf nuns in the Convent of the Moon;\n\nA man among so many girls\n\nTurns it into a brothel and gambling saloon.\n\nSince this young profligate took over\n\nThe Rong Mansion has won a fine reputation.\n\nHe nearly fainted with rage and ordered the gatemen not to breathe a word about it, sending them secretly to search the walls of the lane between the Ning and Rong Mansions for more such posters. He also sent to summon Jia Lian, who came at once.\n\n“Have you ever checked on those nuns and Taoist priestesses staying in the Convent of the Moon in the Water?” demanded Jia Zheng.\n\n“No. Qin has always been in charge there.”\n\n“Do you know if he’s fit to manage it or not?”\n\n“Since you ask, sir, I assume he must have done something wrong.”\n\nJia Zheng sighed. “Just look at this poster!” he said.\n\nJia Lian read it and exclaimed in consternation.\n\nAs they were speaking Jia Rong came in with a letter marked “Confidential for the Second Master.” When opened, it proved to be another anonymous placard like the one on the gate.\n\n“Tell Lai Da to take three or four carriages to the Convent of the Moon in the Water to fetch all the nuns and Taoist nuns,” ordered Jia Zheng. “On no account must this leak out. Just say they’re wanted in the mansion.”\n\nLai Da, having received his orders, went off.\n\nNow the nuns in the Convent of the Moon in the Water...\n\nWhen Jia Qin first started going to the convent, the novices and little Taoist nuns had been under the old abbess’s control and she had taught them scriptures and penances during the day. But since the Imperial Consort had dispensed with their services they had grown lazy. The girls were growing up too and had become more aware of certain things. Jia Qin, a gay young spark himself, assumed that Fang-kuan and the others had taken monastic vows just on a childish impulse, and tried to flirt with them. But Fang-kuan was in earnest and repulsed him, whereupon he turned his attention to the young nuns and novices. One of the novices called Chin-hsiang and a young nun called Ho-hsien were quite bewitching, and he struck up a liaison with them, amusing himself in his spare time by playing stringed instruments or singing songs with them.\n\nOne day in the middle of the tenth month, having drawn their monthly allowance for the convent, he hit on a plan.\n\n“I’ve drawn your pay and can’t go back to town now,” he told them. “I shall have to spend the night here, but it’s so cold and dreary. Suppose I buy some wine and fruit, and we have some fun together this evening?”\n\nThe girls were delighted. They set a table and invited the nuns of the convent too. Only Fang-kuan would not join them.\n\nAfter a few cups Jia Qin proposed playing drinking games.\n\n“We don’t know how,” said Chin-hsiang. “Let’s play ‘guess-fingers’ instead. The loser must drink a cup — that’s simple and lively.”\n\n“It’s only just after noon, and it wouldn’t look good to have a lot of shouting and drinking,” objected one of the nuns. “Let’s just drink a few cups now, and those who want to can leave. Whoever feels like keeping Mr. Qin company can drink as much as she likes this evening. I shan’t interfere.”\n\nAs they were speaking an old serving-woman rushed in.\n\n“Hurry up and break it up!” she cried. “Mr. Lai from the mansion has come.”\n\nThe nuns bustled about clearing the table and urged Jia Qin to hide. He had had a few cups too many, however.\n\n“I came to bring your pay. What have I to fear?” he retorted.\n\nBefore the words were out of his mouth, in came Lai Ta. The sight that met his eyes enraged him; but not daring to disclose his orders from Jia Cheng he put on a smile.\n\n“So you are here, sir,” he said.\n\nJia Qin stood up.\n\n“What brings you here, Mr. Lai?” he asked.\n\n“So you’re here, sir. Good. Tell the novices and nuns to get ready at once and come to town in the carriages. There’s an order from the Palace.”\n\nNot knowing what lay behind this, Jia Qin wanted to question him further.\n\n“It’s growing late. We must hurry back to town,” said Lai Ta.\n\nSo the girls had to get into the carriages. Lai Ta, mounted on a mule, saw the little convoy back to the city. But no more of this.\n\nJia Cheng was so furious when he heard of this scandal that he felt unable to go to his yamen. He sat sighing by himself in his inner study, and Jia Lian dared not leave him. Then the gateman came in to announce:\n\n“Magistrate Chang is on duty tonight, sir, but he’s ill and has sent to ask you to take his place.”\n\nJia Cheng, waiting for Lai Ta’s return to punish Jia Qin, was rather nonplussed by this. He made no comment.\n\nJia Lian stepped forward to say, “Lai Ta left after lunch. The Convent of the Moon in the Water is six or seven miles from the city, so he can’t be back till the second watch. As you have to take Magistrate Chang’s place today, sir, please go to your yamen. When Lai Ta comes back, I’ll tell him to keep those people under guard without breathing a word about this, and you can deal with them tomorrow when you come back. If Qin turns up, I won’t say anything either but wait to hear what he has to say to you tomorrow.”\n\nThis sounded reasonable to Jia Cheng, who went off to his yamen then. Jia Lian, having a little time to himself, started back to his own room. As he walked he reflected angrily that this was all Xifeng’s doing. He would have liked to blame her, but as she was ill he had to suppress his resentment.\n\nMeanwhile, the servants had passed the news on from one to another until it reached Pinger, who immediately reported it to Xifeng. Xifeng, still unwell and listless after her miscarriage, happened just then to be worrying about what had happened in Iron Threshold Temple.\n\nHearing the words “an anonymous poster outside” Xifeng was shocked and asked in alarm, “What’s it about?”\n\nPing’er answered casually, and inadvertently made a slip of the tongue. “Nothing serious. It’s to do with Steamed-Bread Convent.”\n\nXifeng’s own guilty conscience made her freeze in consternation at the words “Steamed-Bread Convent.” She could not get a word out. Then rage and panic brought on a giddiness in which everything went black. A fit of coughing made her choke and slump over, staring blankly into space.\n\nPing’er cried in dismay, “What’s in Water Moon Convent is only some trouble with novices and Taoist nuns. What are you so upset about, madam?”\n\nHearing the name Water Moon Convent Xifeng pulled herself together. “Aiyo!” she exclaimed. “What an idiot! Is it Water Moon Convent or Steamed-Bread Convent?”\n\n“At first I misheard and thought it was Steamed-Bread Convent, but then I was told it wasn’t that, it was Water Moon Convent. Just now I slipped up and said the wrong name.”\n\n“I thought it must be Water Moon Convent. What has Steamed-Bread Convent to do with me? I put Qin in charge of Water Moon Convent, and I suppose he’s been holding back their monthly allowance.”\n\n“From what I heard, it didn’t sound like that. There was some dirty talk too.”\n\n“Well, that’s none of my business. Where’s Master Lian?”\n\n“Hearing that the master was angry, he didn’t dare leave. I was afraid there’d be trouble and told the servants not to make a racket, but I don’t know if Their Ladyships have heard or not. They say the master has sent Lai Da to fetch those girls. We’d better send someone to make inquiries. As you’re unwell, madam, my advice is not to bother about such business.”\n\nAs she was speaking Jia Lian came in. Xifeng was about to question him when she saw that he looked angry, and decided to feign ignorance.\n\nJia Lian had not finished his meal when Wang’er came in to announce, “You’re wanted outside, sir. Lai Da is back.”\n\n“Has Jia Qin come?” asked Jia Lian.\n\n“Yes, he’s here too.”\n\n“Tell Lai Da,” Jia Lian ordered, “that the master has gone to his yamen. He’s to take those girls to the Garden for the time being, and tomorrow when the master comes back they’re to be sent to the palace. Just tell Jia Qin to wait for me in the inner library.”\n\nWang’er assented and left.\n\nWhen Jia Qin went to the library, the servants there pointed at him and he could not tell what they were whispering about. It did not look as if the court had sent for the girls, he thought. He would have liked to ask but could not very well. He was puzzling over this when Jia Lian came out. Jia Qin stepped forward to pay his respects, then stood at attention with his arms at his sides.\n\n“I don’t know why Her Highness has sent so suddenly for these girls,” he said. “I had to make haste. Luckily, as I hadn’t yet left after taking them their monthly allowance, I came along with Lai Da. I suppose you know what it’s about, Second Uncle.”\n\n“How should I know? You’re the one who knows.”\n\nThis left Jia Qin more mystified than ever, but he dared not ask any more questions.\n\n“A fine thing you’ve done!” Jia Lian scolded. “The master’s furious.”\n\n“I haven’t done anything, uncle. The convent’s monthly allowance was paid every month, and the girls didn’t neglect their religious duties.”\n\nSeeing that he was in the dark and remembering that they had often joked together, Jia Lian sighed.\n\n“You’ve asked for a cuffing,” he said. “See for yourself.” He took the poster from his boot and threw it to him.\n\nHe snatched it up and read it, and turned pale. “Who did this?” he cried. “I’ve never offended anyone — why should they try to ruin me? I only go there once a month to deliver the money. None of this ever happened. If the master comes back and questions me under duress, uncle, that will be the death of me! And if my mother hears of it, she’ll beat me to death.” Seeing that there was no one about, he fell on his knees.\n\n“Do save me, uncle!” he begged.\n\nSo saying, he knocked his head on the ground again, his face streaming with tears.\n\n“The master hates this sort of thing most,” reflected Jia Lian. “If he finds out the truth he’ll be furious, and if this gets out it will make a nasty scandal. It will only encourage that writer of the poster, and we’ve plenty more such troubles ahead. The best way is to get Lai Da to help me hush it up while the master’s away. Then we can settle it quietly. As there’s no witness, we can deny it.”\n\nHaving reached this decision he said, “Don’t try to fool me. I know all your dirty tricks. If you want to get off, you must swear, if the master questions you, that there’s not a word of truth in it. You shameless thing! Get up!” He sent to summon Lai Da, who soon arrived, and Jia Lian took him into his confidence.\n\n“Master Qin has been carrying on outrageously,” said Lai Da. “When I went to the convent today, they were drinking there. So what the poster says must be true.”\n\n“Hear that, Qin?” demanded Jia Lian. “Is Lai Da lying too?”\n\nJia Qin flushed scarlet and dared not say a word.\n\nThen Jia Lian drew Lai Da aside and begged him, “Do me a good turn. Say that you found Qin at home. Take him away now, and say you haven’t seen me. Tomorrow ask the master not to question the girls but simply to send for some go-betweens and have them taken away and sold. Then the whole thing will be over. If Her Imperial Highness wants more actresses later on, we can buy some more.”\n\nLai Da reflected that a scandal would do no good but would simply give the family a bad name. So he agreed.\n\nJia Lian told Jia Qin, “Go with Uncle Lai Da. Do whatever he says.”\n\nJia Qin kowtowed again to Jia Lian and left with Lai Da. When they were out of sight he kowtowed again to Lai Da.\n\n“My dear young master,” said Lai Da, “you’ve been carrying on too badly. Who can you have offended to get yourself in such a fix? Think carefully: who is it that has it in for you?”\n\nJia Qin thought hard but could not think of any enemy. He followed Lai Da listlessly back.\n\nIf you want to know how they glossed over this affair, read the next chapter."
