  "original": "话说贾母道：“正是这个了。上次我要说这话，我见你们大事多，如今又添出些事来，你们固然不敢抱怨，未免想着我只顾疼这些小孙子、孙女儿们，就不体贴你们这当家人了。你既这么说出来，便好了。”因此时薛姨妈、李婶娘都在座，邢夫人及尤氏等也都过来请安，还未过去，贾母因向王夫人等说道：“今日我才说这话，素日我不说。一则怕逞了凤丫头的脸，二则众人不服。今日你们都在这里，都是经过妯娌姑嫂的，还有他这么想得到的没有？”薛姨妈、李婶娘、尤氏齐笑道：“真个少有，别人不过是礼上的面情儿，实在他是真疼小姑子、小叔子。就是老太太跟前，也是真孝顺。”贾母点头叹道：“我虽疼他．我又怕他太伶俐了，也不是好事。”凤姐儿忙笑道：“这话老祖宗说差了。世人都说，‘太伶俐聪明怕活不长。’世人都说，世人都信，独老祖宗不当说，不当信。老祖宗只有伶俐聪明过我十倍的，怎么如今这么福寿双全的，只怕我明儿还胜老祖宗一倍呢。我活一千岁后，等老祖宗归了西，我才死呢。”贾母笑道：“众人都死了，单剩咱们两个老妖精，有什么意思。”说的众人都笑了。”宝玉因惦记着晴雯等事，便先回园里来。到了屋中，药香满室，一人不见，只有晴雯独卧于炕上，脸上烧的飞红。又摸了一摸，只觉烫手，忙又向炉上将手烘暖，伸进被去摸了一摸身上，也是火热。因说道：“别人去了也罢，麝月、秋纹也这么无情，各自去了？”晴雯道：“秋纹是我撵了他去吃饭了，麝月是方才平儿来找他出去了。两个人鬼鬼祟祟的，不知说什么。必是说我病了不出去。”宝玉道：“平儿不是那样人。况且他并不知你病特来瞧你，想来一定是找麝月来说话，偶然见你病了，随口说特瞧你的病，这也是人情乖觉取和儿的常事。便不出去，有不是，与他何干，你们素日又好，断不肯为这无于的事伤和气。”晴雯道：“这话也是，只是疑他为什么忽然又瞒起我来？”宝玉笑道：“等我从后门出去，到那窗户根下听说些什么，来告诉你。”\n　　说着，果从后门出去，至窗下潜听。麝月悄悄问道：“你怎么就得了的？”平儿道：“那日彼时洗手时不见了，二奶奶就不许吵嚷，出了园子，即刻就传给园里各处的妈妈们，小心访查。我们只疑惑邢姑娘的丫头，本来又穷，只怕小孩子家没见过，拿起来是有的，再不料定是你们这里的。幸而二奶奶没有在屋里，你们这里的宋妈去了，拿着这支镯子，说是小丫头坠儿偷起来的，被他看见，来回二奶奶的。我赶忙接了镯子，想了一想：宝玉是偏在你们身上留心用意、争胜要强的，那一年有个良儿偷玉，刚冷了这二年，闲时还常有人提起来趁愿。这会子又跑出一个偷金子的来了，而且更偷到街坊家去了。偏是他这么着，偏是他的人打嘴。所以我倒忙叮咛宋妈，千万别告诉宝玉，只当没有这事，总别和一个人提起。第二件，老太太、太太听了生气。三则袭人和你们也不好看。所以我回二奶奶只说：‘我往大奶奶那里去来着，谁知镯子褪了口，丢在草根底下，雪深了没看见。今儿雪化尽了，黄澄澄的映着日头，还在那里呢，我就拣了起来。’二奶奶也就信了，所以我来告诉你们。你们以后防着他些，别使唤他到别处去。等袭人回来，你们商议着，变个法子打发出去就完了。”麝月道：“这小娼妇也见过些东西，怎么这么眼浅？”平儿道：“究竟这镯子能多重，原是二奶奶的，说这叫做‘虾须镯’，倒是这颗珠子重了。睛雯那蹄子是块爆炭，要告诉了他，他是忍不住的，一时气上来，或打或骂，依旧嚷出来，所以单告诉你留心就是了。”说着，便作辞而去。\n　　宝玉听了，又喜又气又叹。喜的是平儿竟能体贴自己的心，气的是坠儿小窃，叹的是坠儿那样伶俐，做出这丑事来。因而回至房中，把平儿之话一长一短告诉了睛雯，又说：“他说你是个要强的，如今病了，听了这话，越发要添病的，等好了再告诉你。”晴雯听了，果然气的蛾眉倒蹙，凤眼园睁，即时就叫坠儿。宝玉忙劝道：“这一喊出来，岂不辜负了平儿待你我的心呢？不如领他这个情，过后打发他出去就完了。”晴雯道：“虽如此说，只是这气如何忍得住！”宝玉道：“这有什么气的，你只养病就是了。”\n　　睛雯服了药，至晚间又服了二和，夜间虽有些汗，还未见效，仍是发烧头疼鼻塞声重。次日，王太医又来诊视，另加减汤剂。虽然稍减了烧，仍是头疼。宝玉便命麝月取鼻烟来：“给他闻些，痛打几个嚏喷就通快了。”麝月果真去取了一个金镶双金星玻璃小扁盒儿来递给宝玉。宝玉便揭开盒盖，里面是个西洋珐琅的黄发赤身女子，两肋又有肉翅，里面盛着些真正上等洋烟。睛雯只顾看画儿，宝玉道：“闻些，走了气就不好了。”睛雯听说，忙用指甲挑了些抽入鼻中。不见怎么，便又多多挑了些抽入。忽觉鼻中一股酸辣，透入卤门，接连打了五六个嚏喷，眼泪鼻涕登时齐流。晴雯忙收了盒子，笑道：“了不得，辣！快拿纸来。”早有小丫头子递过一搭子细纸，晴雯便一张一张的拿来醒鼻子。宝玉笑问：“如何？”睛雯笑道：“果然通快些。只是太阳还疼。”宝玉笑道：“越发尽用西洋药治一治，只怕就好了。”说着，便命麝月：“往二奶奶要去，就说我说了，姐姐那里常有那西洋贴头疼的膏子药，叫做‘依佛哪’，找寻一点儿。”麝月答应去了，半日，果然拿了半节来。便去找了一块红缎子角儿，铰了两块指顶大的圆式，将那药烤和了，用簪挺摊上。晴雯自拿着一面靶儿镜子贴在两太阳上。麝月笑道：“病的蓬头鬼一样，如今贴了这个，倒俏皮了。二奶奶贴惯了，倒不大显。”说毕，又问宝玉道：“二奶奶说了：明儿是舅老爷的生日，太太说了叫你去呢。明儿穿什么衣裳？今儿晚上好打点齐备了，省的明儿早起费手。”宝玉道：“什么顺手就是什么罢了。一年闹生日也闹不清。”说着，便起身出房，往惜春屋里去看画儿。\n　　刚到院门外边，忽见宝琴小丫头名小螺的从那边过去。宝玉忙赶上问：“那里去？”小螺笑道：“我们二位姑娘都在林姑娘屋里呢，我如今也往那里去。”宝玉听了，转步也便和他往潇湘馆来。不但宝钗姐妹在此，且连岫烟也在那里。四人团坐在熏笼上叙家常。紫鹃倒坐在暖阁里，临窗户做针线。一见他来，都笑说：“又来了一个！没了你的坐处了。”宝玉笑道：“好一幅‘冬闺集艳图’，可惜我迟来了。横竖这屋子比各屋子暖，这椅子坐着并不冷。”说着，便坐在黛玉常坐的地方，上搭着灰鼠椅搭一张椅上。因见暖阁之中有一玉石条盆，里面攒三聚五栽着一盆单瓣水仙，宝玉便极口赞道：“好花！这屋子越暖，这花香的越浓。怎么昨儿没见？”黛玉笑道：“这是你家的大总管赖大奶奶送薛二姑娘的两盆水仙、两盆腊梅。他送了我一盆水仙，送了云丫头一盆腊梅。我原不要的，又恐辜负了他的心。你若要，我转送你如何？”宝玉道：“我屋里却有两盆，只是不及这个。琴妹妹送你的，如何又转送人，这个断断使不得。”黛玉道：“我一日药铞子不离火，我竟是药培着呢，哪里还搁的住花香来熏？越发弱了。况且这屋子里一股药香，反把这花香搅坏了。不如你抬了去，这花儿倒清净了，没什么杂味来搅他。”宝玉笑道：“我屋里今儿也有个病人煎药呢。你怎么知道的？”黛玉笑道：“这说奇了。我原是无心话，谁知你屋里的事？你不早来听古记儿，这会子来了，自惊自怪的。”\n　　宝玉笑道：“咱们明儿下一社又有了题目了，就咏水仙、腊梅。”黛玉听了，笑道：“罢，罢！再不敢做诗了。做一回，罚一回，没的怪羞的。”说着，便两手握起脸来。宝玉笑道：“何苦来，又打起我做什么，我还不怕臊呢，你倒握起脸来了。”宝钗因笑道：“下次我邀一社，四个诗题，四个词题。每人四首诗，四首词。头一个诗题《咏太极图》，限‘一先’的韵，五言排律；要把‘一先’的韵都用尽了，一个不许剩。”宝琴笑道：“这一说，可知是姐姐不是真心起社了，这分明是难人。要论起来，也强扭的出来，不过颠来倒去，弄些《易经》上的话生填，究竟有何趣味。我八岁的时节，跟我父亲到西海沿上买洋货。谁知有个真真国的女孩子，才十五岁，那脸面就和那西洋画上的美人一样，也披着黄头发，打着联垂，满头带着都是玛瑙、珊瑚、猫儿眼、祖母绿，身上穿着金丝织的锁子甲，洋锦袄袖，带着倭刀也是镶金嵌宝的。实在画儿上也没他那么好看。有人说他通中国的诗书，会讲‘五经’，能做诗填词。因此我父亲央烦了一位通官，烦他写了一张字，就写他做的诗。”众人都称道奇异。宝玉忙笑道：“好妹妹，你拿出来我们瞧瞧。”宝琴笑道：“在南京收着呢，此时那里去取？”宝玉听了，大失所望，便说：“没福得见这世面！”黛玉笑拉宝琴道：“你别哄我们，我知道你这一来，你的这些东西未必放在家里，自然都是要带上来的。这会子又扯谎，说没带来。他们虽信，我是不信的。”宝琴便红了脸，低头微笑不答。宝钗笑道：“偏这颦儿惯说这些话，你就伶俐的太过了。”黛玉笑道：“带了来，就给我们见识见识也罢了。”宝钗笑道：“箱子笼子一大堆，还没理清呢，知道在那个里头呢？等过日子收拾清了找出来，大家再看罢了。”又向宝琴道：“你要记得，何不念念我们听听？”宝琴答道：“记得他做的五言律一首，要论外国的女子，也就难为他了。”宝钗道：”你且别念，等我把云儿叫了来，也叫他听听。”说着，便叫小螺来，吩咐道：“你到我那里去，就说我们这里有一个外国的美人来了，做的好诗，请你这‘诗疯子’来瞧去，再把我们‘诗呆子’也带来”。小螺笑着去了。\n　　半日，只听湘云笑问：“那一个外国的美人来了？”一头说，一头走，和香菱来了。众人笑道：“人未见形，先已闻声。”宝琴等让坐，遂把方才的话重告诉了一遍。湘云笑道：“快念来听听。”宝琴因念道：\n　　咋夜朱楼梦，今宵水国吟。\n　　岛云蒸大海，岚气接丛林。\n　　月本无今古，情缘自浅深。\n　　汉南春历历，焉得不关心？\n　　众人听了，都道：“难为他，竟比我们中国人还强。”一语未了，只见麝月走来，说：“太太打发了人来告诉二爷，明儿一早往舅舅那里去，就说太太身上不大好，不得亲身来。”宝玉忙站起来答应道：“是。”因问宝钗宝琴：“你们二位可去？”宝钗道：“我们不去。昨儿单送了礼去了。”大家说了一回方散。\n　　宝玉因让诸姐妹先行，自己在后面。黛玉便又叫住他，问道：“袭人到底多早晚回来？”宝玉道：“自然等送了殡才来呢。”黛玉还有话说，又不能出口，出了一回神，便说道：“你去罢。”宝玉也觉心里有许多话，只是口里不知要说什么，想了一想，也笑道：“明儿再说罢。”一面下台阶，低头正欲迈步，复又忙回身问道：“如今夜越发长了，你一夜咳嗽几次？醒几遍？”黛玉道：“昨儿夜里好了，只咳嗽两遍，却只睡了四更一个更次，就再不能睡了。”宝玉又笑道：“正是有句要紧的话，这会子才想起来。”一面说，一面便挨近身来，悄悄道：“我想宝姐姐送你的燕窝……”一语未了，只见赵姨娘走进来瞧黛玉，问：“姑娘这几天可好了？”黛玉便知他从探春处来，从门前过，顺路的人情，忙陪笑让坐，说：“难得姨娘想着，怪冷的，亲自走来。”又忙命倒茶，一面又使眼色给宝玉。宝玉会意，便走了出来。正值吃晚饭时，见了王夫人，又嘱咐他早去。宝玉回来，看睛雯吃了药。此夕宝玉便不命睛雯挪出暖阁来，自己便在晴雯外边。又命将熏笼抬至暖阁前，麝月便在熏笼上睡。一宿无话。\n　　至次日天未明，晴雯便叫醒麝月道：“你也该醒了，只是睡不够。你出去叫人给他预备茶水，我叫醒他就是了。”麝月忙披衣起来道：“咱们叫他起来，穿好衣裳，抬过这火箱去，再叫他们进来。老妈妈们已经说过，不叫他在这屋里，怕过了病气；如今他们见咱们挤在一处，又该唠叨了。”晴雯道：“我也是这么说。”二人才叫时，宝玉已醒了，忙起身披衣。麝月先叫进小丫头子来收拾妥了，才命秋纹等进来，一同伏侍。宝玉梳洗已毕，麝月道：“天又阴阴的，只怕下雪，穿一套毡子的罢。”宝玉点头，即时换了衣裳。小丫头便用小茶盘捧了一盖碗建莲红枣汤来，宝玉喝了两口。麝月又捧过一小碟法制紫姜来，宝玉噙了一块。又嘱咐了晴雯，便忙往贾母处来。\n　　贾母犹未起来，知道宝玉出门，便开了屋门，命宝玉进去。宝玉见贾母身后宝琴面向里睡着未醒。贾母见宝玉身上穿着荔色哆罗呢的箭袖，大红猩猩毡盘金彩绣石青妆缎沿边的排穗褂。贾母道：“下雪呢么？”宝玉道：“天阴着，还没下呢。”贾母便命：“鸳鸯来，把昨儿那一件孔雀毛的氅衣给他罢。”鸳鸯答应走去，果取了一件来。宝玉看时，金翠辉煌，碧彩闪灼，又不似宝琴所披之凫靥裘。只听贾母笑道：“这叫做‘雀金呢’，这是俄罗斯国拿孔雀毛拈了线织的。前儿那件野鸭子的给了你小妹妹，这件给你罢。”宝玉磕了一个头，便披在身上。贾母笑道：“你先给你娘瞧瞧去再去。”宝玉答应了，便出来，只见鸳鸯站在地下揉眼睛。因自那日鸳鸯发誓绝婚之后，他总不合宝玉说话，宝玉正自日夜不安，此时见他又要回避，宝玉便上来笑道：“好姐姐你瞧瞧，我穿着这个好不好？”鸳鸯一摔手，便进贾母屋里来了。宝玉只得到了王夫人屋里，给王夫人看了，然后又回至园中，给晴雯、麝月看过，来回覆贾母说：“太太看了，只说可惜了的，叫我仔细穿，别糟塌了。”贾母道：“就剩了这一件，你糟塌了也再没了。这会子特给你做这个，也是没有的事。”说着又嘱咐：“不许多吃酒，早些回来。”\n　　宝玉应了几个“是”。老嬷嬷跟至厅上，只见宝玉的奶兄李贵、王荣和张若锦、赵亦华、钱升、周瑞六个人，带着焙茗、伴鹤、锄药、扫红四个小厮，背着衣包，拿着坐褥，笼着一匹雕鞍彩辔的白马，已伺候多时了。老嬷嬷又嘱咐他们些话，六个人连应了几个“是”，忙捧鞍坠镫，宝玉慢慢的上了马。李贵、王荣笼着嚼环，钱升、周瑞二人在前引导，张若锦、赵亦华在两边，紧贴宝玉身后。宝玉在马上笑道：“周哥，钱哥，咱们打这角门走罢，省了到老爷的书房门口，又下来。”周瑞侧身笑造：“老爷不在书房里，天天锁着，爷可以不用下来罢了。”宝玉笑道：“虽锁着，也要下来的。”钱升、李贵都笑道：“爷说的是。就托做不下来，倘或遇见赖大爷、林二爷，虽不好说爷，也要劝两句。所有的不是，都派在我们身上，又说我们不教给爷礼了。”周瑞、钱升便一直出角门来。\n　　正说话时，顶头见赖大进来，宝玉忙笼住马，意欲下来。赖大忙上来抱住腿。宝玉便在镫上站起来，笑着，携手说了几句话。接着又见个小厮带着二三十人，拿着扫帚簸箕进来，见了宝玉，都顺墙垂手立住，独为首的小厮打了个千儿，说：“请爷安。”宝玉不知名姓，只微笑点点头儿。马已过去，那人方带人去了。于是出了角门。外有李贵等六人的小厮并几个马夫，早预备下十来匹马专候，一出角门，李贵等各上马前引，一阵烟去了，不在话下。\n　　这里晴雯吃了药，仍不见病退，急的乱骂大夫，说：“只会哄人的钱，一剂好药也不给人吃。”麝月笑劝他道：“你太性急了，俗语说：‘病来如山倒，病去如抽丝。’又不是老君的仙丹，那有这么灵药？你只静养几天，自然就好了。你越急越着手。”晴雯又骂小丫头子们：“那里攒沙去了，瞅着我病了，都大胆子走了。明儿我好了，一个个的才揭了你们的皮！”唬了小丫头子定儿忙进来问：“姑娘做什么？”晴雯道：“别人都死了，就剩了你不成”说着，只见坠儿也蹭进来了。晴雯道：“你瞧瞧这小蹄子，不问他还不来呢。这里又放月钱了，又散果子了，你该跑在头里了。你往前些！我是老虎，吃了你？”坠儿只得往前凑了几步。晴雯便冷不防欠身，一把将他的手抓住，向枕边拿起一丈青来，向他手上乱戳，又骂道：“要这爪子做什么？拈不动针，拿不动线，只会偷嘴吃！眼皮子又浅，爪子又轻，打嘴现世的，不如戳烂了！”坠儿疼的乱喊。麝月忙拉开，按着晴雯躺下，道：“你才出了汗，又作死！等你好了，要打多少打不得，这会子闹什么。”\n　　晴雯便命人叫宋嬷嬷进来，说道：“宝二爷才告诉了我，叫我告诉你们，坠儿很懒，宝二爷当面使他，他拨嘴儿不动，连袭人使他，他也背地里骂。今儿务必打发他出去，明儿宝二爷亲自回太太就是了。”宋嬷嬷听了，心下便知镯子事发，因笑道：“虽如此说，也等花姑娘回来，知道了，再打发他。”晴雯道：“宝二爷今儿千叮吟万嘱咐的，什么‘花姑娘’‘草姑娘’的，我们自然有道理。你只依我的话，快叫他家的人来领他出去。”麝月道：“这也罢了。早也是去，晚也是去，早带了去，早清净一日。”宋嬷嬷听了，只得出去唤了他母亲来，打点了他的东西。又见了晴雯等，说道：“姑娘们怎么了？你侄女儿不好，你们教导他，怎么撵出去？也到底给我们留个脸儿。”晴雯道：“这话只等宝玉来问他，与我们无干。”那媳妇冷笑道：“我有胆子问他去？他那一件事不是听姑娘们的调停？他纵依了，姑娘们不依，也未必中用。比如方才说话，虽背地里，姑娘就直叫他的名字，在姑娘们就使得，在我们就成了野人了！”\n　　晴雯听说，越发急红了脸，说道：“我叫了他的名字了。你在老太太、太太跟前告我去，说我野，也撵出我去！”麝月道：“嫂子你只管带了人出去，有话再说。这个地方岂有你叫喊讲理的。你见谁和我们讲过理？别说嫂子你，就是赖大奶奶、林大娘也得担待我们三分。就是叫名字，从小儿直到如今，都是老太太吩咐过的，你们也知道的，恐怕难养活，巴巴的写了他的小名儿各处贴着，叫万人叫去，为的是好养活，连挑水挑粪花子都叫得，何况我们！连昨儿林大娘叫了一声‘爷’，老太太还说呢。此是一件。二则我们这些人，常回老太太、太太的话去，可不叫着名回话，难道也称‘爷’？那一日不把‘宝玉’两字叫二百遍，偏嫂子又来挑这个了。过一天嫂子闲了，在老太太、太太跟前听听我们当着面儿叫他，就知道了。嫂子原也不得在老太太、太太跟前当些体统差使，成年家只在三门外头混，怪不得不知道我们里头的规矩。这里不是嫂子久站的，再一会，不用我们说话，就有人来问你了。有什么分证的话，且带了他去，你回了林大娘，叫他来找二爷说话。家里上千的人，他也跑来，我也跑来，我们认人问姓还认不清呢！”说着，便叫小丫头子：“拿了擦地的布来擦地！”那媳妇听了，无言可对，亦不敢久站，赌气带了坠儿就走。宋嬷嬷忙道：“怪道你这嫂子不知规矩。你女儿在屋里一场，临去时也给姑娘们磕个头。没有别的谢礼，他们也不希罕，不过磕个头尽心罢咧，怎么说走就走？”坠儿听了，只得翻身进来，给他两个磕头。又找秋纹等，他们也并不睬他。那媳妇声叹气，口不敢言，抱恨而去。\n　　晴雯方才又闪了风，着了气，反觉更不好了。翻腾至掌灯，刚安静了些，只见宝玉回来，进门就声顿脚。麝月忙问原故，宝玉道：“今儿老太太喜喜欢欢的给了这件褂子，谁知不防，后襟子上烧了一块。幸而天晚了，老太太、太太都不理论。”一面脱下来。麝月瞧时，果然有指顶大的烧眼，说：“这必定是手炉里的火迸上了。这不值什么，赶着叫人悄悄拿出去叫个能干织补匠人织上就是了。”说着，就用包袱包了，叫了一个嬷嬷送出去，说：“赶天亮就有才好，千万别给老太太、太太知道。”婆子去了半日，仍就拿回来，说：“不但织补匠，能干裁缝、绣匠并做女工的，问了，都不认的这是什么，都不敢揽。”麝月道：“这怎么好呢？明儿不穿也罢了。”宝玉道：“明儿是正日子，老太太、太太说了，还叫穿过这个去呢。偏头一日就烧了，岂不扫兴！”\n　　晴雯听了半日，忍不住，翻身说道：“拿来我瞧瞧罢！没那福气穿就罢了，这会子又着急。”宝玉笑道：“这话倒说的是。”说着，便递给晴雯，又移过灯来，细瞧了一瞧。晴雯道：“这是孔雀金线的。如今咱们也拿孔雀金线，就象界线似的界密了，只怕还可混的过去。”麝月笑道：“孔雀线现成的，但这里除你，还有谁会界线？”晴雯道：“不用你蝎蝎螫螫的，我自知道。”一面说，一面坐起来，挽了一挽头发，披了衣裳。只觉头重身轻，满眼金星乱迸，实实掌不住。待不做，又怕宝玉着急，少不得狠命咬牙捱着。便命麝月只帮着拈线，晴雯先拿了一根比一比，笑道：“这虽不很象，要补上也不很显。”宝玉道：“这就很好，那里又找俄罗斯国的裁缝去？”晴雯先将里子拆开，用茶杯口大小一个竹弓钉绷在背面，再将破口四边用金刀刮的散松松的，然后用针缝了两条，分出经纬，亦如界线之法，先界出地子来，后依本纹来回织补。补两针，又看看；织补不上三五针，便伏在枕上歇一会。宝玉在旁，一时又问：“吃些滚水不吃？”一时又命：“歇一歇。”一时又拿一件灰鼠斗篷替他披在背上，一时又拿个枕头给他靠着。急的晴雯央道：“小祖宗，你只管睡罢！再熬上半夜，明儿眼睛抠搂了，那恰怎么好？”\n宝玉见他着急，只得胡乱睡下，仍睡不着。一时只听自鸣钟已敲了四下，刚刚补完；又用小牙刷慢慢的剔出绒毛来。麝月道：“这就很好，要不留心，再看不出的。”宝玉忙要了瞧瞧，笑说：“真真一样了。”晴雯已嗽了几声，好容易补完了，说了一声：“补虽补了，到底不象。我也再不能了！”“嗳哟”了一声，就身不由主睡下了。\n要知端的，且看下回分解。",
  "translation": "Lady Jia replied, “That’s just it. The last time I thought of mentioning this, you all had so much on your hands and now there are fresh complications. Not that you’d dare complain, but you probably think I only care about these young grandchildren and have no consideration for you who have to manage things. Since you’ve brought this up yourself, that’s all right.”\n\nAunt Xue and Aunt Li were present at the time, and Lady Xing and Madam You had come to pay their respects but not yet left. The Lady Dowager said to Lady Wang and the rest:\n\n“This is the first time I’ve said this. I didn’t mention it before for fear of making Xifeng conceited, and also because the others might not be convinced. Now that you’re all here, and as married women you know how things should be managed, can any of you think of a better way?”\n\nAunt Xue, Aunt Li and Madam You agreed, “None of us could. Other people just keep up appearances, but she’s genuinely fond of her young sisters- and brothers-in-law. And she’s truly good to the old lady too.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded and sighed, “Though I love her, I’m afraid she may be too clever for her own good.”\n\nXifeng smiled.\n\n“You’re wrong to say that, Old Ancestress. There’s a saying that clever people don’t live long. Everybody says it and everybody believes it, but not you, Old Ancestress — you shouldn’t say such things or believe them. You’re a hundred times cleverer than I am. How is it you enjoy such good fortune and longevity? I expect to live twice as long as you. I’ll die a thousand years after you have gone to the west.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager chuckled, “When all the others are dead, what use would there be in our two old hags remaining alive?”\n\nThis set everybody laughing.\n\nBaoyu, anxious to know how Qingwen was, went back to the Garden. His room was filled with the scent of medicine but was quite empty except for Qingwen lying alone on the kang, her face flushed with fever. When he felt her forehead it was burning. Having warmed his hand at the stove, he felt under the bedding and found her body feverish too.\n\n“I don’t mind if the others desert you,” he said, “but how could Sheyue and Qiuwen be so heartless as to go off and leave you all alone?”\n\n“I sent Qiuwen to her meal,” Qingwen told him. “Sheyue was called away just now by Pinger. They were whispering together in a very hole-and-corner way — no doubt because I’m ill and can’t go out.”\n\n“Pinger’s not like that,” objected Baoyu. “Besides, she didn’t know you were ill and come to see you. Most likely she wanted to have a word with Sheyue, and when she happened to find you ill just said she’d come to see how you were — that’s the normal way to keep on good terms with people. Whether you go out or not is no business of hers. You’ve always been good friends, she’d never risk falling out with you over a thing of no importance.”\n\n“That may be, but why should she start being so secretive all of a sudden?”\n\n“I’ll go out by the back door and listen under the window to find out what they’re saying, then let you know.”\n\nHe went out accordingly to eavesdrop under the window.\n\n“How did you get it back?” Sheyue was asking softly.\n\n“That day after I’d washed my hands it disappeared,” Pinger replied. “And Madam Lian wouldn’t let us make a fuss but sent to warn the matrons in the different compounds to keep a look-out. We suspected Miss Xing’s maid. As they’re so poor and the child’s young, we thought she might have picked it up. We’d never have suspected one of your girls. Luckily Madam Lian wasn’t in when your matron, nanny Song, came with this bracelet. She said your young maid Zhui’er had stolen it, she’d seen her and come to report it to Madam Lian. I took the bracelet quickly and thought to myself: Baoyu is the only one who’s so considerate and likes to outdo others. That year...”\n\nIt’s only two years since Liang stole the Lady’s jade, and even now in their spare time people still talk about it with relish. Now here’s another case of pilfering — gold this time, and from one of our own neighbours too. Of all people it had to be one of us, and it’s our own people who are made to lose face. So I made a point of warning Nanny Sung not to tell Baoyu, but just to ignore the whole business and not breathe a word to anyone. In the first place, the old lady and the mistress would be angry. Secondly, it would look bad for Xiren and the rest of you. So I told Madam Lian, “I went to see Madam Zhu, and my bracelet must have slipped off my wrist without my knowing it and dropped in the snow by the root of some plant. The snow was so deep, I couldn’t see it. Today, after the thaw, there it was glittering in the sun. So I picked it up.” Madam Lian believed me. That’s why I’m telling you: from now on, watch that girl and don’t send her on any errands outside. When Xiren comes back, put your heads together and think of some way to send her packing.”\n\n“The little slut has seen plenty of things,” said Sheyue. “How could she be so petty?”\n\n“It’s not all that heavy,” said Pinger. “It belongs to Madam Lian and it’s called a ‘Shrimp Whisker’ bracelet, but this pearl in it is valuable. That bitch Qingwen is a real spitfire. If she were told, she’d never be able to keep it to herself but would lose her temper and either beat or curse the girl, and so the whole story would come out. That’s why I’m telling you to watch out for her.” With that she took her leave.\n\nBaoyu, half pleased and half angry, heaved a sigh. He was pleased that Pinger had shown such consideration for his feelings, angry at Zhuier’s theft, and sorry that a clever girl like her should have done such a shameless thing. Going back to his room, he told Qingwen the whole story from beginning to end.\n\n“She says you’re so high-spirited, now that you’re ill this would make you worse,” he concluded. “She wanted us to wait till you were better before telling you.”\n\nAs expected, Qingwen flared up. Her eyebrows bristled angrily and her eyes widened. She called for Zhuier at once.\n\n“If you make an outcry, you’ll be letting Pinger down after the way she’s treated us,” Baoyu expostulated. “We’d better do as she says and just send the girl away later.”\n\n“I know you’re right,” snapped Qingwen, “but how can I swallow this anger?”\n\n“What does it matter to you? Just concentrate on getting well.”\n\nAfter taking her medicine that evening, Qingwen took a second dose later on. Although this made her sweat a little, she was still feverish and her head and nose were stuffed up. The next day Doctor Wang came again and changed the prescription. This brought her fever down a little, but she still had a headache.\n\n“Fetch some snuff,” Baoyu told Sheyue. “She’ll feel better after a good sneeze or two.”\n\nSheyue brought a small flat glass box inlaid with a double gold star design. Baoyu opened it. The lid had on its inner side a painting of a yellow-haired, naked girl with fleshy wings under her arms. The box contained some genuine superior Western snuff. Qingwen kept her eyes fixed on the picture.\n\n“Smell it,” urged Baoyu. “The scent will go off if it’s exposed too long.”\n\nAt once she dipped a fingernail in the snuff and raised it to her nose, but it had no effect. She scooped up some more and again inhaled it. Suddenly a pungent stench assailed her nostrils, penetrating to the acupoint on the crown of her head. She sneezed five or six times in succession until her nose and eyes were running. Having hastily put away the box, she cried laughingly:\n\n“My word, that’s hot! Quick, pass me some paper.”\n\nA young maid handed her a sheaf of fine paper, and she used sheet after sheet to blow her nose.\n\n“Well, how do you feel now?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“Better,” she answered. “But my head still aches.”\n\n“You’d better have some more Western treatment then. That may cure you.” He turned to Sheyue. “Go and ask for some Western medicine for headaches. Tell them it’s for me.”\n\nSheyue promised to do this. After some time she came back with half a stick. Having found a scrap of red satin, she cut out two small round patches, melted the medicine and spread it on them with a hairpin. Qingwen herself held a hand-mirror while Sheyue applied the two patches to her temples.\n\n“You look a fright with your hair all over the place, but these patches become you,” chuckled Sheyue. “Madam Xifeng usually wears them, but they don’t show up so well on her.”\n\nShe added to Baoyu, “Madam Lian says that tomorrow is your uncle’s birthday, and the mistress wants you to go. What will you wear? Get it ready this evening to save trouble in the morning.”\n\n“Whatever comes to hand,” he answered. “I’m sick and tired of all these birthdays.”\n\nWith that he left the room and went to see Xichun’s painting. Outside the courtyard he ran into Baoqin’s little maid Xiaoluo.\n\n“Where are you going?” he asked.\n\n“Our two young ladies are with Miss Lin, and I’m on my way there too.”\n\nBaoyu turned and accompanied her to Bamboo Lodge. He found not only Baoqin but Baoqin and Xiuyan there as well. The four girls were sitting cosily on the warmer, chatting. Zijuan was on the couch by the window doing needlework. At sight of Baoyu they cried with one accord:\n\n“Here comes another! There’s no room for you.”\n\n“A fine painting this would make — Winter Beauties Gathering!” he joked. “What a pity I’ve come too late. Anyway, this room is warmer than any other, and this chair I’m sitting on isn’t cold.” He settled down in Daiyu’s usual seat on a chair with a grey squirrel cover. Noticing in the inner room a long jade pot in which were planted a number of single-petalled narcissi, he exclaimed in admiration, “What lovely flowers! The warmer it is, the sweeter they smell. How is it I didn’t notice them yesterday?”\n\n“This is one of two pots of narcissus and two of winter plum sent to Cousin Baoqin by your steward Lai Da’s wife,” Daiyu told him. “She gave me a pot of narcissus and Xichun a pot of winter plum. I didn’t really want it, but couldn’t refuse for fear of hurting her feelings. If you like it, you can have it.”\n\n“I have two pots in my room, but not as fine as this. How can I take the one Cousin Baoqin gave you? That would never do.”\n\n“I’m stewing medicine all the time in here over the fire,” said Daiyu. “How can flowers stand being smoked by all these medicinal smells? It would be the death of them. Besides, the smell of medicine here overpowers any faint fragrance they have, so that they’re wasted. You’d better take them. Once the flowers are away from here with no other smells to spoil them, they’ll keep their fragrance.”\n\nBaoyu laughed. “I’ve someone ill in my place today too, brewing medicine. How did you know?”\n\nDaiyu laughed too. “That’s strange. I was just speaking off-hand. How should I know what goes on in your room? If you’d come earlier to hear the old tales, you wouldn’t be talking such nonsense now.”\n\n“Well, we’ve a subject for our next poetry meeting,” he cried. “We can write poems on the narcissus and winter plum.”\n\n“No, no!” Daiyu shook her head. “I daren’t write any more poems. Whenever I do, I’m penalized. It’s too embarrassing.” She covered her face with her hands.\n\n“Why should that make you cover your face?” he teased. “I’m not embarrassed, and it’s my fault you were penalized.”\n\n“Next time I start a club,” put in Baochai, “we’ll have four subjects for poems and four for lyrics. Each member will have to write four poems and four lyrics. The first poem will be on The Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate, with the rhyme ‘first celestial’ and the form a five-character regulated verse....”\n\n“You must use all the rhymes in the first group of the ‘hsien’ rhyme,” she decreed. “Not one may be left out.”\n“If that’s the rule,” protested Pao-chin, “I’m sure you aren’t serious about starting a club, cousin. This is just a way of making things difficult. Of course, if we have to, we can force ourselves to comply, but we’ll just be turning things upside down and padding out our lines with phrases from the Book of Changes. Where’s the fun in that?\n“When I was eight I went with my father to the West Ocean to buy foreign goods, and there we met a girl from Chen-chen Kingdom who was just fifteen. Her face was like the beauties painted by foreign artists. She had golden hair hanging down in coils, her head was covered with coral, agate, amber and emeralds, and she was wearing a chain armour jacket of gold thread and a sleeveless jacket of foreign brocade. In her sash she had a Japanese sword inlaid with gold and gems — she was even lovelier than the girls in those paintings. They say she was well versed in Chinese poetry and the Five Classics, and could compose poems and songs too. So my father asked an interpreter to request a sample of her calligraphy, and she wrote out a poem she had composed.”\nThe others exclaimed in surprise.\n“Dear cousin!” cried Pao-yu eagerly. “Do let us see it.”\n“It’s in Nanking,” she replied. “How can I fetch it now?”\nHe was most disappointed. “I’ve no luck,” he sighed.\nTai-yu, taking Pao-chin’s hand, said with a smile, “Don’t tease us. I know that when you come here you must have brought all your treasures with you. You’re just pretending they’re not here. The others may believe you, but I don’t.”\nPao-chin flushed and lowered her head with a smile, but said nothing.\n“This Chai always says such embarrassing things,” remarked Pao-chai. “You’re too sharp by half.”\n“If you have brought it, let us see it,” begged Tai-yu.\n“There are so many cases and hampers, we haven’t sorted them out yet,” said Pao-chai. “Who knows which one it’s in? Do be patient. We’ll look it out one of these days when we’ve straightened up, and then you can all see it.” She turned to Pao-chin. “If you remember it, why not recite it for us?”\n“I remember it was a pentameter verse,” replied Pao-chin. “For a foreign girl, it was really not too bad.”\n“Don’t recite it yet,” cried Pao-chai. “I’ll send for Yun so that she can hear too.” She told a maid, “Go to my place and say that a foreign beauty has come here who writes good poetry. Ask the ‘poetry maniac’ to come and have a look, and bring our ‘poetry addict’ with her.”\nThe maid went off chuckling.\nPresently they heard Hsiang-yun asking, “Which foreign beauty has arrived?” In she came with Hsiang-ling, talking as she walked.\nThe others laughed.\n“Here comes one who’s heard before she’s seen!”\nPao-chin and the rest asked them to be seated and repeated the story.\n“Out with it, quick!” cried Hsiang-yun.\nSo Pao-chin recited:\nLast night in scarlet mansions dreams were made;\nTonight by ocean’s rim we sing farewell.\nThe island’s clouds enshroud the mighty sea,\nThe mist wreaths in the woods on the mount dwell.\nThe moon shines now as in the days of old,\nBut sentiments deep or shallow vary.\nIn south Hanaan spring is green and bold,\nHow can my homesick heart not be wary?\n“It’s amazing,” they cried. “She’s better than we Chinese.”\nThey were interrupted by the arrival of Sheh-yueh, who announced, “Her Ladyship has sent to tell Master Pao that first thing tomorrow he must go to his uncle’s. She isn’t well enough to go herself.”\nPao-yu stood up to acknowledge this order.\n“Will you two be going?” he asked Pao-chai and Pao-chin.\n“No,” said Pao-chai. “We sent our presents yesterday.”\nThey chatted for a while longer before dispersing.\nPao-yu made the girls go on ahead, bringing up the rear himself.\n“Listen, Cousin Chai,” called Tai-yu.\n\nShe detained him with another question. “When is Xiren coming back?”\n\n“Not till after the funeral, of course.”\n\nDaiyu had more to say but could not come out with it. After a moment’s reflection she said, “You can go now.”\n\nBaoyu too felt that he had a great deal to say but did not know how to express it. After some thought he replied with a smile, “We’ll talk again tomorrow.” He was going down the steps when he turned back to ask, “Now the nights are so long, how many times do you cough and how often do you wake?”\n\n“I was better last night — only coughed a couple of times and woke just once, at the fourth watch; but after that I couldn’t get to sleep again.”\n\n“I’ve just remembered something important I must tell you,” he said with a smile. Stepping closer he whispered, “I think the bird’s nest Cousin Baochai sent you....”\n\nHe broke off as Concubine Zhao came in to see Daiyu and ask how she was. Daiyu knew that she had come from Tanchun’s place and was just looking in as she passed, to keep up appearances. Smiling, the girl hastily offered her a seat.\n\n“It’s good of you to think of me, aunt,” she said. “It’s bitterly cold too — you shouldn’t have taken the trouble to come.” She ordered tea and shot Baoyu a warning glance. Taking the hint, he slipped away.\n\nIt was time for the evening meal. He saw Lady Wang, who urged him to go back early. Upon his return he watched Qingwen take her medicine, and that evening he did not make her move out of the warm alcove but slept on the outer bed himself, having the warming basket moved there too for Sheyue to sleep on. And so the night passed.\n\nThe next day before dawn Qingwen woke Sheyue.\n\n“It’s time you were up,” she said. “You never seem to have enough sleep. Go and tell them to prepare tea for him while I wake him.”\n\nSheyue threw on her clothes.\n\n“We’d better call him to get up and dressed, and have this fire-basket moved out before letting them in,” she said. “The old nurses have already warned us not to let him sleep here for fear of infection. If they see us all crowded together, they’ll scold again.”\n\n“That’s what I think too.”\n\nBut as they were on the point of calling him, Baoyu woke and threw on his clothes at once. Sheyue first called in a young maid to clear the room, then told Qiuwen and the others to come in and wait on him. When he had washed and combed his hair, Sheyue said, “It’s overcast — it may snow. Better wear a suit padded with felt.”\n\nHe nodded and changed his clothes, then a young maid handed him a covered bowl of broth made of lotus-seeds and red dates in a small tea-tray. He drank a few mouthfuls, after which Sheyue offered him some preserved ginger; he chewed a piece. Then, having given some instructions to Qingwen, he went to his grandmother’s place.\n\nThe Lady Dowager had not yet got up but, knowing that Baoyu had to go out, she opened her door and called him in. He saw that Baoqin was still asleep, her face to the wall. His grandmother, observing his dark-red archer’s jacket embroidered with dragons and lined with fox-fur, and his dark blue fringed formal coat embroidered with gold thread and variegated designs and bordered with striped velvet, asked, “Is it snowing?”\n\n“It’s overcast but not snowing yet.”\n\n“Bring him that peacock-feather cape we got the other day,” the old lady ordered Yuanyang, who assented and went to fetch it.\n\nBaoyu saw that the cape was made of gold thread and peacock feathers which glistened with a green and gold iridescence, quite different from Baoqin’s wild-duck cape.\n\n“This is called ‘peacock gold,’” his grandmother told him. “It was woven from peacock feathers with gold thread in Russia. That wild-duck cape I gave your young cousin, and this one is for you.”\n\nBaoyu kowtowed his thanks then threw the cape over his shoulders.\n\n“Show it to your mother first before you go,” she said.\n\nHe assented and was leaving when he saw Yuanyang standing there\n\nRubbing her eyes, she sat down on the ground. Ever since Yuanyang’s vow to cut herself off from marriage, she had refused to speak to Baoyu, who was most upset by this. Now, seeing that she was avoiding him again, he went up to her with a smile.\n\n“Dear sister, just look! Does this suit me?”\n\nYuanyang shook off his hand and went into the Lady Dowager’s room.\n\nBaoyu had to go then to Lady Wang’s apartments to show her his new clothes. After that he went back to the Garden to let Qingwen and Sheyue see them, then returned to report to his grandmother, “My mother said it’s a pity to wear this, and I must be careful not to spoil it.”\n\n“This is the only one left,” said the Lady Dowager. “If you spoil it there’ll be no more. We certainly can’t have another made for you now.” She warned him, “Don’t drink too much, and come back early.”\n\nBaoyu assented repeatedly. The old nurse who accompanied him to the hall found his foster-brother Li Gui and Wang Rong, with Zhang Ruojin, Zhao Yihua, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rui — six serving-men in all — who had been waiting for some time with Beiming, Banhe, Chuyao and Saohong, four younger pages. The pages were carrying his clothes-wrap and a sitting-rug, and holding a white horse with a carved saddle and bright trappings. The old nurse gave the men some further instructions, to which they responded with a respectful “Yes.” Then, hastily helping Baoyu into the saddle by supporting his elbow, they slowly mounted him. Li Gui and Wang Rong took the bridle, Qian Sheng and Zhou Rui led the way, Zhang Ruojin and Zhao Yihua fell in on either side close behind Baoyu.\n\nRiding along, Baoyu said with a smile, “Brother Zhou, Brother Qian, let’s go by the side gate. That will save me dismounting at the gate of my father’s study.”\n\nZhou Rui smiled sidelong at him. “The master’s not in his study, sir. It’s locked every day. You don’t have to dismount.”\n\n“Even if it’s locked, I ought to dismount,” countered Baoyu.\n\n“You’re quite right, sir,” agreed Qian Sheng and Li Gui. “Even if you were excused from dismounting, if you happened to meet Mr. Lai or Mr. Lin, though they couldn’t very well take you to task for it they’d feel they should drop a hint. Then all the blame would be laid at our door for not teaching you the rules of propriety.”\n\nSo Zhou Rui and Qian Sheng led the way straight to the side gate. As they were talking, who should they see but Lai Da coming towards them. Baoyu promptly reined in, meaning to dismount. But Lai Da hurried over to take hold of his leg, and Baoyu stood up in his stirrups and taking the steward’s hand exchanged a few words with him with a smile.\n\nThen a young servant appeared at the head of twenty or thirty men with brooms and dust-pans. At sight of Baoyu they lined up against the wall, their hands at their sides. The young servant in charge alone dropped one knee in a salute.\n\n“I hope you are well, sir,” he said.\n\nNot knowing his name, Baoyu simply nodded and smiled. Then his horse walked on and the servant led his men away. Once outside the side gate, Li Gui and the five other serving-men mounted the dozen or so horses waiting ready for them and, with the pages, swiftly escorted Baoyu away. But no more of this.\n\nMeanwhile Qingwen, having taken her medicine, was still no better. In desperation she roundly abused the doctor.\n\n“He’s only out to fool people and make money,” she fumed. “He doesn’t even know how to prescribe effective medicine.”\n\n“You’re too impatient.” Sheyue laughed. “As the proverb says, ‘Illness comes as fast as a wall falling down, but goes as slowly as unravelling a cocoon.’ This isn’t some miraculous pill of Lao Jun’s. Just take it easy for a few days and you’re bound to get better. It’s no use being so impatient.”\n\nQingwen started abusing the younger maids too. “Where have you all sneaked off to?” she scolded. “Now that I’m ill you think you can take it easy. Just you wait till I’m better — I’ll skin every one of you alive.”\n\nThis so alarmed the young maid Ding that she came running in.\n\n“What can I do for you, miss?” she asked.\n\n“Are all the others dead that you’re the only one left?” snapped Qingwen.\n\nJust then Zhuier came sidling in.\n\n\"Well, the monthly allowance is being distributed and fruit is being given out here too,\" she cried. \"You should be in the forefront. Come closer! Am I a tiger that I'm going to eat you?\"\n\nZhuier had to take a few steps forward. Qingwen suddenly leaned forward and seized her hand, then taking a hairpin from the pillow she jabbed it wildly at the girl's fingers.\n\n\"What's the use of these claws of yours?\" she scolded. \"You can't even sew properly, you're only good at sneaking things to eat. You've greedy eyes but no sense of propriety, and make a disgraceful exhibition of yourself. Better let me stab them to bits!\"\n\nZhuier, yelping with pain, was rescued by Sheyue, who made Qingwen lie down again.\n\n\"You've just been sweating,\" she said. \"Do you want to kill yourself? Wait till you're better and you can beat her as much as you like. Why carry on like this now?\"\n\nQingwen then ordered that Nanny Song be summoned.\n\n\"Master Bao has just told me to tell you that Zhuier's too lazy to be of any use,\" she announced. \"Even when he gives her orders himself she doesn't stir a finger, and she swears at Xiren behind her back. She must be sent away today. Tomorrow Master Bao will report this to the mistress.\"\n\nNanny Song, hearing this, knew that the bracelet had been discovered.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said. \"But we'd better wait till Xiren comes back and knows about it before sending her away.\"\n\n\"Master Bao's given strict orders today,\" snapped Qingwen. \"Why should we wait for Miss Hua or Miss This or That? We know how to handle this. Just do as I say and quickly send for her parents to take her away.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" put in Sheyue. \"She'll have to go sooner or later. The sooner she's taken away, the sooner we'll have some peace.\"\n\nNanny Song had to go out then and fetch Zhuier's mother, who came to collect her daughter's belongings. The woman appealed to Qingwen and the other girls.\n\n\"What's the matter, young ladies?\" she asked. \"If my niece has behaved badly, you should discipline her. Why turn her out? Do have some consideration for our face.\"\n\n\"If you've anything to say, say it to Baoyu. It's nothing to do with us,\" retorted Qingwen.\n\n\"You think I'd dare bother him?\" The woman smiled bitterly. \"He doesn't do a thing without you young ladies prompting him. Even if he agreed, if you were against it that wouldn't help. Just now, for instance, though you were talking behind his back you called him by his name. That's all right for young ladies like you, but if we did that we'd be accused of having no manners.\"\n\nThis so enraged Qingwen that she flushed.\n\n\"So I called him by his name, did I?\" she cried. \"Go and report me to the old lady and the mistress, and have me sent away too for having no manners.\"\n\n\"Sister, you just take your girl away,\" interposed Sheyue. \"If you've anything to say, say it later. This is no place for you to argue and shout. Who have you ever seen reasoning with us here? Not just you, sister, but even Mrs. Lai and Mrs. Lin have to put up with us. As for calling him by his name, that was the old lady's orders from the time he was small. You know that too. They were afraid it would be hard to rear him, so they had his milk-name written out and pasted up all over the place for everyone to use, to ensure that he'd live to grow up. Even the water-carriers, dung-carriers and beggars all use it, not to say us. The other day, when Mrs. Lin called him 'sir,' the old lady was most upset. That's one thing.\n\n\"Another thing: We often have to report to the old lady and the mistress. We can't very well refer to him as 'sir' then, can we? Why, we must use the name Baoyu two hundred times a day here. So don't you go picking on us, sister. When you have time, listen to us reporting to the old lady or the mistress and you'll hear how we address him to his face.\n\n\"Of course, you've never done any high-class work for the old lady or the mistress, sister. You spend all your time outside the third gate, so it's not surprising you don't know the rules in the inner apartments. This is no place for you to stand around long. In a little while, without our having to say anything, someone will....\"\n\nI’ve come to ask you. If you’ve anything to say, take her away and tell Mrs. Lin from me to come and have this out with the Second Master. In a household of several hundred, if she comes running here and I go running there, how can we tell who’s who?” She called to a young maid, “Bring a floor-cloth to mop the floor!”\n\nThe woman had not a word to say to this and dared not stay any longer. She went off in a huff with Zhuier.\n\nNanny Song urged her, “No wonder you’ve no idea of the rules, sister. But since your daughter has worked here, she should kotow to the young ladies before leaving. They don’t expect any other thanks, but a kotow is the least she can do. How can you just whisk her off like that?”\n\nWhen Zhuier heard this she turned back and kotowed to Qingwen and Xiren. She looked round for Qiuwen and the others too, but they ignored her. The woman snorted and sighed, not venturing to say anything, and went off resentfully.\n\nQingwen’s chill and anger had made her fever worse. She tossed and turned until lighting-up time, and had just quietened down when Baoyu came back. He stamped with vexation as he entered the room.\n\nSheyue asked what had happened.\n\n“The old lady was so pleased today, she gave me this coat,” he said. “But, would you believe it, I wasn’t careful enough and I’ve burned a hole in the back. Luckily it was late and neither the old lady nor my mother noticed.” He took the coat off.\n\nSheyue saw a burn the size of a finger-tip. “This must have been done by a spark from a hand-stove,” she said. “It doesn’t matter. We can get someone to take it out quietly to a skilled weaver and have it rewoven. It’ll be all right.” She wrapped it up in a handkerchief and told an old nurse to have it seen to, adding, “Get it back by tomorrow if possible, and mind nobody hears of this in the old lady’s or madam’s apartments.”\n\nThe old woman was gone for some time, then came back with the coat.\n\n“Not only weavers,” she reported, “but even tailors, embroiderers and needlewomen — I asked them all, and not one of them knows what material this is. None of them dares take on the job.”\n\n“What’s to be done?” asked Sheyue. “You’ll just have to wear something else tomorrow.”\n\n“Tomorrow is the formal occasion, and the old lady and my mother have both told me to wear this,” he said. “Won’t it be a bore if it’s burned on the first day I have it on?”\n\nQingwen had been listening for some time. Unable to contain herself she turned over and said, “Let me have a look at it. If you can’t wear it, that’s that. But why get so worked up about it?”\n\n“You’re right of course,” he chuckled, and passed it to her. Then he moved the lamp closer for her to see.\n\n“This is woven of peacock gold thread,” she said. “Now if we took some of that and sewed it in fine stitches, the mend might not show too badly.”\n\n“We’ve got the thread all right,” said Sheyue. “But who here can do that except you?”\n\n“I’ll have to do my poor best, that’s all.”\n\nAs she spoke she sat up, pushed back her hair and threw on some clothes. She felt her head swim and her eyes saw stars, so that she could hardly keep upright. But knowing how worried Baoyu was, if she did not do it she forced herself to grit her teeth and bear it. She told Sheyue to help her by threading the needles.\n\nFirst Qingwen held a length of the thread to the light. “This isn’t quite the same, but it won’t show too much when it’s mended,” she said.\n\n“That’s fine,” said Baoyu. “Where could we find a Russian tailor?”\n\nQingwan first unpicked the lining and pinned the hole over a small bamboo frame. Then she caught together the loose threads, drew them in and laid them evenly. Next she passed the needle in and out, in and out, following the original weave. After a few stitches she stopped to rest her head on the pillow.\n\nBaoyu, hovering beside her, urged her now to take a sip of hot water, now to rest.\n\nXiren had to lie down then, although not to sleep. She just closed her eyes in the warm bed.\n\nBaoyu, watching Qingwen and Sheyue get ready to mend the cape, found the burner and iron too close to the bed and feared they would disturb Xiren.\n\n“You’d better work in the other room,” he suggested. “There’s a big stove there and you can help yourselves to wine or anything you want.”\n\nThe two girls assented and moved to the outer room, where they set up the iron and started preparing the cape. First they found a piece of the same material to back the hole, then they laid this on the frame and sewed the edges together. Next they unravelled the golden thread of the border and extracted four strands of the green angora with which to darn the hole so that the mend would be invisible. This done, they would pick out the pile with a small toothbrush.\n\nBaoyu watched them as they worked. Now he urged Qingwen to have a sip of brandy, now he called for Xiren to rest well, now he tucked Sheyue’s mantle round her for fear she should feel the cold, now he passed them a pillow to lean on — till Qingwen begged him:\n\n“Do go to bed, little ancestor! If you sit up half the night again, your eyes will be sunk tomorrow. Then what will you do?”\n\nTo humour her he lay down, but still he could not sleep. Presently the clock struck four. Just as the work was finished, Qingwen was slowly brushing up the pile.\n\n“That’s fine,” approved Sheyue. “If you didn’t look carefully, you’d never notice.”\n\nBaoyu asked to see it at once.\n\n“It looks exactly the same,” he cried delightedly.\n\nQingwen had been coughing and sneezing.\n\n“Yes, it’s mended,” she said. “But it’s not too good. I’m afraid I can’t do any better.”\n\nWith that she collapsed on the couch.\n\nIf you want to know what followed, read the next chapter."
