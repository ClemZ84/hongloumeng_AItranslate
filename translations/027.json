  "original": "话说黛玉正自悲泣，忽听院门响处，只见宝钗出来了，宝玉、袭人一群人都送出来。待要上去问着宝玉，又恐当着众人问羞了宝玉不便，因而闪过一旁，让宝钗去了，宝玉等进去关了门，方转过来，尚望着门洒了几点泪。自觉无味，转身回来，无精打彩的卸了残妆。紫鹃、雪雁素日知道黛玉的情性，无事闷坐，不是愁眉，便是长叹，且好端端的不知为着什么，常常的便自泪不干的。先时还有人解劝，或怕他思父母，想家乡，受委屈，用话来宽慰。谁知后来一年一月的，竟是常常如此，把这个样儿看惯了，也都不理论了。所以也没人去理他，由他闷坐，只管外间自便去了。那黛玉倚着床栏杆，两手抱着膝，眼睛含着泪，好似木雕泥塑的一般，直坐到二更多天方才睡了。一宿无话。\n　　至次日，乃是四月二十六日，原来这日末时交芒种节。尚古风俗：凡交芒种节的这日，都要设摆各色礼物，祭饯花神，言芒种一过，便是夏日了，众花皆卸，花神退位，须要饯行。闺中更兴这件风俗，所以大观园中之人都早起来了。那些女孩子们，或用花瓣柳枝编成轿马的，或用续锦纱罗叠成千旄旌幢的，都用彩线系了，每一棵树头每一枝花上，都系了这些物事。满园里绣带飘摇，花枝招展，更兼这些人打扮的桃羞杏让，燕妒莺惭，一时也道不尽。\n　　且说宝钗、迎春、探春、惜春、李执、凤姐等并大姐儿、香菱与众丫环们，都在园里玩耍，独不见黛玉，迎春因说道：“林妹妹怎么不见？好个懒丫头，这会子难道还睡觉不成？”宝钗道：“你们等着，等我去闹了他来。”说着，便撂下众人，一直往潇湘馆来。正走着，只见文官等十二个女孩子也来了，上来问了好，说了一回闲话儿，才走开。宝钗回身指道：“他们都在那里呢，你们找他们去，我找林姑娘去就来。”说着，逶迤往潇湘馆来。忽然抬头见宝玉进去了，宝钗便站住，低头想了一想：“宝玉和黛玉是从小儿一处长大的，他兄妹间多有不避嫌疑之处，嘲笑不忌，喜怒无常！况且黛玉素多猜忌，好弄小性儿，此刻自己也跟进去，一则宝玉不便，二则黛玉嫌疑，倒是回来的妙。”想毕，抽身回来，刚要寻别的妹妹去。忽见面前一双玉色蝴蝶，大如团扇，一上一下，迎风翩翩，十分有趣。宝钗意欲扑了来玩耍，遂向袖中取出扇子来，向草地下来扑。只见那一双蝴蝶忽起忽落，来来往往，将欲过河去了。引的宝钗蹑手蹑脚的，一直跟到池边滴翠亭上，香汗淋漓，娇喘细细。宝钗也无心扑了，刚欲回来，只听那亭里边喊喊喳喳有人说话。原来这亭子四面俱是游廊曲栏，盖在池中水上，四面雕镂桶子，糊着纸。宝钗在亭外听见说话，便煞住脚往里细听。只听说道：“你瞧这绢子果然是你丢的那一块，你就拿着；要不是，就还芸二爷去。”又有一个说：“可不是我那块！拿来给我罢。”又听道：“你拿什么谢我呢？难道白找了来不成？”又答道：“我已经许了谢你，自然是不哄你的。”又听说道：“我找了来给你，自然谢我；但只是那拣的人，你就不谢他么？”那一个又说道：“你别胡说。他是个爷们家，拣了我们的东西，自然该还的。叫我拿什么谢他呢？”又听说道：“你不谢他，我怎么回他呢？况且他再三再四的和我说了，若没谢的，不许我给你呢。”半晌，又听说道：“也罢，拿我这个给他，算谢他的罢。你要告诉别人呢？须得起个誓。”又听说道：“我告诉人，嘴上就长一个疔，日后不得好死！”又听说道：“嗳哟！咱们只顾说，看仔细有人来悄悄的在外头听见。不如把这隔子都推开了，就是人见咱们在这里，他们只当我们说玩话儿呢。走到跟前，咱们也看的见，就别说了。”\n　　宝钗外面听见这话，心中吃惊，想道：“怪道从古至今那些奸淫狗盗的人，心机都不错，这一开了，见我在这里，他们岂不躁了？况且说话的语音，大似宝玉房里的小红。他素昔眼空心大，是个头等刁钻古怪的丫头，今儿我听了他的短儿，‘人急造反，狗急跳墙’，不但生事，而且我还没趣。如今便赶着躲了料也躲不及，少不得要使个‘金蝉脱壳’的法子。”犹未想完，只听“咯吱”一声，宝钗便故意放重了脚步，笑着叫道：“颦儿，我看你往那里藏！”一面说一面故意往前赶。那亭内的小红坠儿刚一推窗，只听宝钦如此说着往前赶，两个人都唬怔了。宝钗反向他二人笑道：“你们把林姑娘藏在那里了？”坠儿道：”何曾见林姑娘了？”宝钗道：“我才在河那边看着林姑娘在这里蹲着弄水儿呢。我要悄悄的唬他一跳，还没有走到跟前，他倒看见我了，朝东一绕，就不见了。别是藏在里头了？”一面说，一面故意进去，寻了一寻，抽身就走，一内说道：“一定又钻在山子洞里去了。遇见蛇，咬一口也罢了。”一面说，一面走，心中又好笑：“这件事算遮过去了。不知他二人怎么样？”\n　　谁知小红听了宝钗的话，便信以为真，让宝钗去远，便拉坠儿道：“了不得了，林姑娘蹲在这里，一定听了话去了！”坠儿听了，也半日不言语。小红又道：“这可怎么样呢？”坠儿道：“听见了，管谁筋疼！各人干各人的就完了。”小红道：“要是宝姑娘听见还罢了。那林姑娘嘴里又爱克薄人，心里又细，他一听见了，倘或走露了，怎么样呢？”二人正说着，只见香菱、臻儿、司棋、侍书等上亭子来了。二人只得掩住这话，且和他们玩笑。只见凤姐站在山坡上招手儿，小红便连忙弃了众人，跑至凤姐前，堆着笑问：“奶奶使唤做什么事？”凤姐打量了一回，见他生的干净俏丽，说话知趣，因笑道：“我的丫头们今儿没跟进我来。我这会子想起一件事来，要使唤个人出去，不知你能干不能干？说的齐全不齐全？”小红笑道：“奶奶有什么话，只管吩咐我说去，要说的不齐全，误了奶奶的事，任凭奶奶责罚就是了。”凤姐笑道：“你是那位姑娘屋里的？我使你出去，他回来找你，我好替你说。”小红道：“我是宝二爷屋里的。”凤姐听了笑道：“嗳哟！你原来是宝玉屋里的，怪道呢。也罢了，等他问，我替你说。你到我们家告诉你平姐姐，外头屋里桌子上汝窑盘子架儿底下放着一卷银子，那是一百二十两，给绣匠的工价。等张材家的来，当面秤给他瞧了，再给他拿去。还有一件事，里头床头儿上有个小荷包儿，拿了来。”小红听说，答应着，撤身去了。\n　　不多时回来，不见凤姐在山坡上了，因见司棋从山洞里出来，站着系带子，便起来问道：“姐姐，不知道二奶奶往那里去了？”司棋道：“没理论。”小红听了，回身又往四下里一看，只见那边探春、宝钗在池边看鱼，小红上来陪笑道：“姑娘们可知道二奶奶刚才那里去了？”探春道：“往你大奶奶院里找去。”小红听了，再往稻香村来，顶头见晴雯、绮霞、碧痕、秋纹、麝月、侍书、入画、莺儿等一群人来了。晴雯一见小红，便说道：“你只是疯罢！院子里花儿也不浇雀儿也不喂，茶炉子也不弄，就在外头逛！”小红道：“昨儿二爷说了，今儿不用浇花儿，过一日浇一回。我喂雀儿的时候儿，你还睡觉呢。”碧痕道：“茶炉子呢？”小红道：“今儿不该我的班儿，有茶没茶，别问我。”绮霞道：“你听听他的嘴！你们别说了，让他逛罢。”小红道：“你们再问问，我逛了没逛。二奶奶才使唤我说话取东西去。”说着，将荷包举给他们看，方没言语了，大家走开。睛雯冷笑道：“怪道呢！原来爬上高枝儿去了，就不服我们说了。不知说了一句话半句话，名儿姓儿知道了没有，就把他兴头的这个样儿。这一遭半遭儿的也算不得什么，过了后儿，还得听呵。有本事从今儿出了这园子，长长远远的在高枝儿上才算好的呢！”一面说着去了。\n　　这里小红听了，不便分证，只得忍气来找凤姐。到了李氏房中，果见凤姐在这里和李氏说话儿呢。小红上来问道：“平姐姐说：奶奶刚出来了，他就把银子收起来了！才张材家的来取，当面秤了给他拿了去了。”说着，将荷包递上去。又道：“平姐姐叫我来回奶奶，才旺儿进来讨奶奶的示下，好往那家子去，平姐姐就把那话按着奶奶的主意打发他去了。”凤姐笑道：“他怎么按着我的主意打发去了呢？”小红道：“平姐姐说：‘我们奶奶问这里奶奶好。我们二爷没在家。虽然迟了两天，只管请奶奶放心。等五奶奶好些，我们奶奶还会了五奶奶来瞧奶奶呢。五奶奶前儿打发了人来说，舅奶奶带了信来了，问奶奶好，还要和这里的姑奶奶寻几丸延年神验万金丹，若有了，奶奶打发人来，只管送在我们奶奶这里。明儿有人去，就顺路给那边舅奶奶带了去。’”小红还未说完，李氏笑道：“嗳哟！这话我就不懂了，什么‘奶奶’‘爷爷’的一大堆。”凤姐笑道：“怨不得你不懂，这是四五门子的话呢。”说着，又向小红笑道：“好孩子，难为你说的齐全，不象他们扭扭捏捏蚊子似的。嫂子不知道，如今除了我随手使的这几个丫头老婆之外，我就怕和别人说话，他们必定把一句话拉长了，作两三截儿，咬文嚼字，拿着腔儿，哼哼唧唧的，急的我冒火，他们那里知道？我们平儿先也是这么着，我就问着他，难道必定装蚊子哼哼就算美人儿了？说了几遭儿才好些儿了。”李执笑道：“都象你泼辣货才好。”凤姐道：“这个丫头就好。刚才这两遭说话虽不多，口角儿就很剪断。”说着，又向小红笑道：“明儿你伏侍我罢，我认你做干女孩儿。我一调理，你就出息了。”\n　　小红听了，“扑哧”一笑。凤姐道：“你怎么笑？你说我年轻，比你能大几岁，就做你的妈了？你做春梦呢！你打听打听，这些人比你大的赶着我叫妈，我还不理呢，今儿抬举了你了。”小红笑道：“我不是笑这个，我笑奶奶认错了辈数儿了。我妈是奶奶的干女孩儿，这会子又认我做干女孩儿！”凤姐道：“谁是你妈？”李纨笑道：“你原来不认的他，他是林之孝的女孩儿。”凤姐听了十分诧异，因说道：“哦，是他的丫头啊。”又笑道：“林之孝两口子，都是锥子扎不出一声儿来的。我成日家说，他们倒是配就了的一对儿：一个‘天聋’，一个‘地哑’。那里承望养出这么个伶俐丫头来！你十几了？”小红道：“十七岁了。”又问名字。小红道：“原叫‘红玉’，因为重了宝二爷，如今只叫小红了。”凤姐听说，将眉一皱，把头一回，说道：“讨人嫌的很！得了‘玉’的便宜似的，你也‘玉’我也‘玉’。”因说：“嫂子不知道，我和他妈说：‘赖大家的如今事多，也不知这府里谁是谁，你替我好好儿的挑两个丫头找使。”他只管答应着，他饶不挑，倒把他的女孩儿送给别处去，难道跟我必定不好？”李纨笑道：“你可是又多心了。进来在先，你说在后，怎么怨的他妈？”凤姐也笑道：“既这么着，明儿我和宝玉说，叫他再要人，叫这丫头跟我去。可不知本人愿意不愿意？”小红笑道：“愿意不愿意，我们也不敢说。只是跟着奶奶，我们学些眉眼高低，出入上下，大小的事儿，也得见识见识。”刚说着，只见王夫人的丫头来请，凤姐便辞了李纨去了。小红自回怡红院去，不在话下。\n　　如今且说黛玉，因夜间失寝，次日起来迟了，闻得众姐妹都在园中做饯花会，恐人笑他痴懒，连忙梳洗了出来。刚到了院中，只见宝玉进门，来了便笑道：“好妹妹，你昨儿告了我了没有？叫我悬了一夜的心。”黛玉便回头叫紫鹃：“把屋子收拾了，下一扇纱屉子，看那大燕子回来，把帘子放下来，拿狮子倚住。烧了香，就把炉罩上。”一面说，一面又往外走。宝玉见他这样，还认作是昨日晌午的事，那知晚间的这件公案？还打恭作揖的。黛玉正眼儿也不看，各自出了院门，一直找别的姐妹去了。宝玉心中纳闷，自己猜疑：“看起这样光景来，不象是为昨儿的事。但只昨日我回来的晚了，又没有见他，再没有冲撞他的去处儿了。”一面想，一面由不得随后跟了来。\n　　只见宝钗、探春正在那边看鹤舞，见黛玉来了，三个一同站着说话儿。又见宝玉来了，探春便笑道：“宝哥哥身上好？我整整的三天没见你了。”宝玉笑道：“妹妹身上好？我前儿还在大嫂子跟前问你呢。”探春道：“宝哥哥，你往这里来，我和你说话。”宝玉听说，便跟了他，离了钗、玉两个，到了一棵石榴树下。探春因说道：“这几天，老爷没叫你吗？”宝玉笑道：“没有叫。”探春道：“昨儿我恍惚听见说，老爷叫你出去来着。”宝玉笑道：“那想是别人听错了，并没叫我。”探春又笑道：“这几个月，我又攒下有十来吊钱了。你还拿了去，明儿出门逛去的时候，或是好字画，或轻巧玩意儿，替我带些来。”宝玉道：“我这么逛去，城里城外大廊大庙的逛，也没见个新奇精致东西，总不过是那些金、玉、铜、磁器，没处撂的古董儿，再么就是绸缎、吃食、衣服了。”探春道：“谁要那些作什么！象你上回买的那柳枝儿编的小篮子儿，竹子根儿挖的香盒儿，胶泥垛的风炉子儿就好了，我喜欢的了不的。谁知他们都爱上了，都当宝贝儿似的抢了去了。”宝玉笑道：“原来要这个。这不值什么，拿几吊钱出去给小子们，管拉两车来。”探春道：“小厮们知道什么？你拣那有意思儿又不俗气的东西，你多替我带几件来，我还象上回的鞋做一双你穿，比那双还加工夫，如何呢？”\n　　宝玉笑道：“你提起鞋来，我想起故事来了。一回穿着，可巧遇见了老爷，老爷就不受用，问：‘是谁做的？’我那里敢提三妹妹，我就回说是前儿我的生日舅母给的。老爷听了是舅母给的，才不好说什么了。半日还说：‘何苦来！虚耗人力，作践绫罗，做这样的东西。’我回来告诉了袭人，袭人说：‘这还罢了，赵姨娘气的抱怨的了不得：正经亲兄弟，鞋塌拉袜塌拉的没人看见，且做这些东西！”探春听说，登时沉下脸来，道：“你说，这话糊涂到什么田地！怎么，我是该做鞋的人么？环儿难道没有分例的？衣裳是衣裳，鞋袜是鞋袜，丫头老婆一屋子，怎么抱怨这些话？给谁听呢！我不过闲着没事作一双半双，爱给那个哥哥兄弟，随我的心，谁敢管我不成！这也是他瞎气。”宝玉听了，点头笑道：“你不知道，他心里自然又有个想头了。”\n　　探春听说，一发动了气，将头一扭，说道：“连你也糊涂了！他那想头，自然是有的。不过是那阴微下贱的见识。他只管这么想。我只管认得老爷太太两个人，别人我一概不管。就是姐妹弟兄跟前，谁和我好，我就和谁好，什么偏的庶的，我也不知道。论理我不该说他，但他忒昏愦的不象了！还有笑话儿呢，就是上回我给你那钱，替我买那些玩的东西，过了两天，他见了我，就说是怎么没钱，怎么难过。我也不理。谁知后来丫头们出去了，他就抱怨起我来，说我攒的钱为什么给你使，倒不给环儿使呢！我听见这话，又好笑又好气。我就出来往太太跟前去了。”正说着，只见宝钗那边笑道：“说完了来罢，显见的是哥哥妹妹了，撂下别人，且说体己去。我们听一句儿就使不得了？”说着，探春宝玉二人方笑着来了。\n　　宝玉因不见了黛玉，便知是他躲了别处去了。想了一想：“索性迟两日，等他的气息一息再去也罢了。”因低头看见许多凤仙石榴等各色落花，锦重重的落了一地，因叹道：“这是他心里生了气，也不收拾这花儿来了。等我送了去，明儿再问着他。”说着，只见宝钗约着他们往后头去。宝玉道：“我就来。”等他二人去远，把那花儿兜起来，登山渡水，过树穿花，一直奔了那日和黛玉葬桃花的去处。\n　　将已到了花冢，犹未转过山坡，只听那边有呜咽之声，一面数落着，哭的好不伤心。宝玉心下想道：“这不知是那屋里的丫头，受了委屈，跑到这个地方来哭？”一面想，一面煞住脚步，听他哭道是：\n　　花谢花飞飞满天，红消香断有谁怜？\n　　游丝软系飘春榭，落絮轻沾扑绣帘。\n　　闺中女儿惜春暮，愁绪满怀无着处。\n　　手把花锄出绣帘，忍踏落花来复去？\n　　柳丝榆荚自芳菲，不管桃飘与李飞。\n　　桃李明年能再发，明年闺中知有谁？\n　　三月香巢初垒成，梁间燕子太无情。\n　　明年花发虽可啄，却不道人去梁空巢已倾。\n　　一年三百六十日，风刀霜剑严相逼。\n　　明媚鲜妍能几时，一朝飘泊难寻觅。\n　　花开易见落难寻，阶前愁杀葬花人。\n　　独把花锄偷洒泪，洒上空枝见血痕。\n　　杜鹃无语正黄昏，荷锄归去掩重门。\n　　青灯照壁人初睡，冷雨敲窗被未温。\n　　怪侬底事倍伤神？半为怜春半恼春。\n　　怜春忽至恼忽去，至又无言去不闻。\n　　昨宵庭外悲歌发，知是花魂与鸟魂？\n　　花魂鸟魂总难留，鸟自无言花自羞。\n　　愿侬此日生双翼，随花飞到天尽头。\n　　天尽头，何处有香丘？\n　　未若锦囊收艳骨，一抔净土掩风流。\n　　质本洁来还洁去，不教污淖陷渠沟。\n　　尔今死去侬收葬，未卜侬身何日丧？\n　　侬今葬花人笑痴，他年葬侬知是谁？\n　　试看春残花渐落，便是红颜老死时。\n　　一朝春尽红颜老，花落人亡两不知！\n正是一面低吟，一面哽咽。那边哭的自己伤心，却不道这边听的早已痴倒了。\n要知端详，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Dai-yu was weeping in her room when the sound of the courtyard gate made her look up. She saw Bao-chai come out, escorted by Bao-yu and Aroma and a whole crowd of other maids. She would have liked to have gone up and asked Bao-yu what the matter was, but she was unwilling to embarrass him by doing so in front of all the others. Accordingly she slipped to one side and let Bao-chai pass, waiting until Bao-yu and the rest had gone back inside and shut the gate before coming out again. She stood for a while gazing after them, the tears streaming down her cheeks, then, conscious of the pointlessness of what she was doing, turned back and listlessly began removing her ornaments and preparing for the night.\n\nNow Nightingale and Snowgoose were well used to their young mistress’s moods. They knew that it was her habit, whenever she had nothing else to do, to sit on her own, frowning and sighing and crying for no apparent reason. At first, when she had been like this, they had tried to reason with her, imagining that she was fretting for her parents and her home or that she had been upset about something and needed to be jollied out of it. But as month succeeded month and year succeeded year and the same mood continued, they had gradually become accustomed to it and had learned to take no notice. So now, when they saw her sitting there on her own, crying, they ignored her and went about their own business outside. Dai-yu leaned against the bed-rail, clasping her knees with her arms, and sat staring before her, the tears still wet upon her cheeks. It was after ten o’clock before at last she lay down to sleep.\n\nNothing else happened that night.\n\nThe following day was the twenty-sixth of the fourth month. It was the day on which the festival of Grain in Ear was due to begin. According to ancient custom, at the beginning of Grain in Ear everyone made offerings of various gifts to the Flower Goddess, because Grain in Ear was the time when the hot weather began and all the flowers died, and the Flower Goddess was obliged to quit the world on that day. This custom was particularly observed in women’s quarters, and consequently everyone in Prospect Garden was up betimes that morning. The girls had made little coaches and horses and flags and banners out of flowers and willow-twigs and coloured silks, and had tied these creations to every tree and flower. The garden was a glittering, fluttering scene of colour. And the women themselves, decked out in their gayest, most summery finery, made a sight so dazzling that it is impossible to do justice to it.\n\nPresently Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun, Li Wan, Xi-feng and little Jia Qiao- jie, together with Caltrop and all the maids, were to be found in the garden, all save Dai-yu.\n\n‘Where’s Cousin Lin?’ said Ying-chun. ‘What a lazy-bones! Why, she can’t still be asleep at this hour!’\n\n‘I’ll go and haul her out,’ said Bao-chai. ‘Just you wait here. I’ll bring her.’\n\nShe turned from the others and made off in the direction of the Naiad’s House. As she was walking along, she caught sight of Wen-guan and the eleven other little actresses, who came up to greet her and stood chatting with her for a while. Bao-chai turned back and pointed.\n\n‘They’re all over there,’ she said. ‘You can go and join them if you like. I’m just going to get Cousin Lin. I’ll be with you again in a minute.’\n\nShe continued on her way. Suddenly she raised her head and saw Bao-yu going into the Naiad’s House. She stopped and lowered it again, thinking.\n\n‘Bao-yu and Dai-yu grew up together from childhood. They have an understanding that permits a good deal of informality. They laugh and joke together and are not afraid of showing their feelings. They are often moody and quarrelsome. And Dai-yu is so suspicious. If I were to go in now after him, assuming that he wants to see her on his own, he would feel embarrassed; and if Dai-yu were to suspect that I had followed him in, she might easily take offence. No, I think on the whole I’d better go back.’\n\nShe was on the point of turning back to look for the other girls when she noticed two jade-coloured butterflies, each as big as a circular fan, dancing in the breeze ahead of her. Up and down they went and round and round, and Bao-chai was so fascinated by their graceful flight that she set off in pursuit of them, taking the fan from her sleeve and waving it at them to bring them down. The butterflies fluttered away towards the river and over the water. Just as she was about to abandon the chase, they flew off again, and this time she followed them right to the water’s edge, to a little mound covered with greenery on which stood a painted pavilion. Drenched in perspiration and panting for breath, she abandoned the chase at last and made to turn back. But just at that moment she heard someone talking inside the pavilion.\n\nThe Dripping Emerald Pavilion was built out over the water. It had ‘cameo’ balustrades on all four sides and latticed walls on three of them, the fourth side being the one through which one entered. The lattices were of a ‘basket-weave’ pattern, inset with little pieces of coloured glass.\n\nPao-chai, outside, stopped to listen when she heard this.\n\n“If this handkerchief is really the one you lost, take it,” one girl was saying. “If not, give it back to Master Yun.”\n\n“It’s mine. Let me have it.”\n\n“What will you give me for finding it? You don’t expect me to get it back for you for nothing, do you?”\n\n“I’ve already promised to reward you. Of course I won’t go back on my word.”\n\n“I found it and gave it to you, so naturally you should reward me. But what about the person who picked it up? Are you going to give him nothing?”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense. He’s a gentleman. If he picked up our things, of course he should return them. What could I give him anyway?”\n\n“If you won’t reward him, how am I to answer him? Besides, he made me promise again and again that if you offered no reward I wasn’t to give you the handkerchief.”\n\nAfter a short silence the other said, “All right, I’ll give him this of mine to show my gratitude. But if you tell anyone, may you get a boil on your mouth and die a nasty death!”\n\n“Hey! We were so busy talking, we didn’t keep a look-out. Someone may have been listening outside on the sly. Let’s open the casements. Then if anyone comes we shall see them and can stop talking.”\n\nPao-chai outside was taken aback. “No wonder,” she thought, “from ancient times to the present all treacherous people have been so cunning. If they open the casement and see me here, they’ll be desperate. Besides, the speaker sounded very like Hsiao-hung in Pao-yu’s apartments. She’s such a proud, strange, sly little creature. Now that I’ve caught her out, ‘Desperation drives men to rebel and a dog to jump over a wall.’ If she thinks I’ve overheard her secret she may do something desperate. That would be awkward for me. It’s too late to hide. I must try to throw them off the scent.”\n\nWhile she was still thinking, the window flew open with a creak. Pao-chai promptly stepped forward with a laugh, calling:\n\n“Where are you going to hide, Tai-yu?” She pretended to be peering round as she hurried forward.\n\nHsiao-hung and Chui-erh, who had just opened the casement, were staggered to see Pao-chai bearing down on them. She smiled at the two girls.\n\n“Where have you hidden Miss Lin?” she asked.\n\n“We haven’t seen Miss Lin,” said Chui-erh.\n\n“I saw her from the other side of the stream, squatting here playing with the water. I was going to steal up and give her a fright, but before I could reach her she saw me and disappeared eastwards. Are you sure she’s not hiding in there?” As she spoke she stepped in to make a show of looking round, then came out again. “If she’s slipped into some grotto and a snake bites her, that will be the end of her.” She went off chuckling to herself, “She’s hoodwinked them. I wonder what they’ll do now.”\n\nNow Hsiao-hung believed Pao-chai’s story. As soon as the latter was out of sight she caught hold of Chui-erh.\n\n“Heavens!” she cried. “If Miss Lin was here squatting down, she must have heard us.”\n\nChui-erh said nothing for some time.\n\n“What shall we do?” asked Hsiao-hung.\n\n“Even if she did hear, what’s that to us? Let’s each go about our own business.”\n\n“If it had been Miss Pao-chai, it wouldn’t have mattered. But Miss Lin is so sarcastic and so sharp. If she overheard and it gets out, what shall we do?”\n\nJust then Xiangling, Zhener, Siqi and Shishu came up to the arbour, so the two of them broke off their conversation and started joking with the newcomers. They saw Xifeng standing on the slope beckoning, and Hongyu at once left the others and ran up to her.\n\n“What can I do for you, madam?” she asked with a smile.\n\nXifeng looked her over and was favourably impressed by her neat, pretty appearance and her pleasant way of talking.\n\n“My maids didn’t follow me today,” she said. “But a little business has just occurred to me and I need someone to take a message. I wonder if you’re capable and have a good memory?”\n\n“Just tell me what you want done, madam. If I get it wrong and something goes wrong, you can punish me as you think fit.”\n\n“Which young lady’s apartment are you from? If I send you and she asks for you, I can put in a word for you.”\n\n“I work for Master Bao.”\n\n“Oh, so you’re in Master Bao’s place.” Xifeng burst out laughing. “Well, never mind. If he asks for you, I’ll explain. I want you to go to my house and tell Patience that under the Ru-ware dish-stand on the table in the outer room there’s a packet of a hundred and twenty taels of silver — wages for the embroiderers. When Zhang Cai’s wife comes for it, she’s to check the weight with her before handing it over. And there’s another thing. On the bedside table inside is a little purse. Bring me that.”\n\nHongyu assented and went off. When she came back after a short time, Xifeng was no longer on the slope. She saw Siqi come out of the grotto, adjusting her sash as she stood there.\n\n“Do you know where the Second Mistress has gone, sister?” she asked, going up to her.\n\n“Haven’t the least idea.”\n\nHongyu looked all round. She saw Tanchun and Baochai by the pool watching the fish and went up to them with a smile.\n\n“Do you know where the Second Mistress has gone, young ladies?”\n\n“Try the Eldest Mistress’s place,” said Tanchun.\n\nSo Hongyu went on to Paddy-Sweet Cottage. She ran into Qingwen, Qixia, Bihen, Qiuwen, Sheyue, Shishu, Ruhua, Yinger and some others.\n\n“So here you are, you crazy thing!” cried Qingwen at sight of her. “The flowers haven’t been watered nor the birds given their food, the tea-stove hasn’t been lit, yet you gad outside.”\n\n“Yesterday the master said there was no need to water the flowers every day; every other day will do. I fed the birds while you were still in bed.”\n\n“What about the tea-stove?”\n\n“It wasn’t my turn today. Whether there’s tea or not is no business of mine.”\n\n“Just listen to her!” cried Qixia. “Keep your opinions to yourself and let her gad if she wants.”\n\n“You’d better make some inquiries before accusing me of gadding,” retorted Hongyu. “The Second Mistress sent me on an errand to take a message and fetch something.” She held up the purse. “Well, am I gadding or not?”\n\nAt that they went off, but not before Qingwen had sneered, “No wonder. Now that she’s climbed up to a higher branch she’s too grand to take orders from us. I don’t know whether she’s even learned the name of the place she’s going to, but she’s already giving herself such airs. This once or twice doesn’t count. She’ll have to take orders from us later on. Let’s see whether she’s really good enough to leave the Garden for good and stay on that high branch.”\n\nHongyu could not very well answer back. Swallowing her anger she went to find Xifeng. She discovered her in Li Wan’s room chatting with the mistress there.\n\n“Patience says that as soon as you’d left, madam, she put the silver away,” announced Hongyu. “And when Zhang Cai’s wife came for it she weighed it in her presence before giving it to her.”\n\n\"She’s taken it.\" With that she handed the purse to Xifeng. \"Sister Ping told me to tell you, madam, that just now Wang Er came to ask for your instructions about going to that family, and she sent him off as you thought fit.\"\n\n\"How come she sent him off as I thought fit?\" Xifeng asked laughingly.\n\n\"Sister Ping said, 'Our lady sends her compliments to Your Ladyship. Our master isn’t at home. Though we’re a couple of days late, please don’t worry, madam. When the fifth mistress is better, our lady will come with her to see you. The other day the fifth mistress sent word that our mistress’ sister-in-law has written to ask after her and wants to ask the young lady here to get her some of that longevity elixir. If you have any, madam, please send it to our lady. The next time someone goes that way, she’ll see it’s taken to the mistress’ sister-in-law.’\"\n\nBefore she could finish, Li Wan interposed, \"Mercy on us! I can’t make head or tail of all these mistresses.\"\n\nXifeng laughed. \"No wonder you couldn’t follow. She was referring to four or five different households.\" She turned to Xiaohong. \"You’re a good child, you’ve a clear tongue — not like the mincing, mumbling way they have. You don’t know, cousin,\" she told Li Wan, \"apart from Pinger and the other maids and nurses I have with me, I hate having to talk to any of the rest. They mumble and hum and haw, drawling out each word and putting on airs. It makes me lose all patience. They’ve no idea how exasperating they are. Pinger used to be just the same, but I asked her whether she had to buzz like a mosquito to be considered beautiful. It took several scoldings to cure her.\"\n\nLi Wan said with a smile, \"What a terror you are! You’d like everyone to be a terror like yourself.\"\n\n\"This girl’s all right,\" replied Xifeng. \"She didn’t say much just now, but she spoke clearly and to the point.\" She turned back to Xiaohong. \"How would you like to work for me and be my god-daughter? I’ll make something of you if you let me train you.\"\n\nXiaohong burst out laughing at this.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\" demanded Xifeng. \"Do you think I’m too young to be your godmother — only a few years older than you? Well, you’re dreaming. Go and ask the others. Some who are older than you are want to call me ‘mother,’ but I won’t have them. Today I’m doing you an honour.\"\n\n\"It’s not that.\" Xiaohong smiled. \"I was laughing because you’ve mixed up the generations. My mother is your goddaughter, and now you want to make me your goddaughter too.\"\n\n\"Who is your mother?\" asked Xifeng.\n\nLi Wan put in, \"You don’t know her, but she’s the daughter of Lin Zhixiao.\"\n\nXifeng was quite taken aback. \"So she’s their daughter.\" She exclaimed, \"Why, those two are like a pair of grouses, they never open their mouths. I’ve always said they’re a well-matched couple — one ‘deaf’ and the other ‘dumb.’ Fancy them having a sharp girl like you! How old are you?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"What’s your name?\"\n\n\"I used to be called Hongyu, but as that sounded too much like Baoyu, now I’m just called Xiaohong.\"\n\nXifeng frowned and turned away her head. \"It’s disgusting the way people try to jump on the bandwagon,\" she remarked. \"They all want ‘yu’ too.\" She told Li Wan, \"You don’t know, but I said to her mother, ‘Mrs. Lai has so much to do now, she can’t keep track of everyone in the house. Pick out a couple of good girls for me to work here.’ She agreed, but instead of picking anyone she sent her own daughter.\"\n\n‘Go somewhere else? Do you really think you’d be worse off with me?’ \n\nLi Wan laughed. \n\n‘There you go again — always so suspicious! She was here first and you only spoke afterwards. You can’t blame the mother for that.’ \n\nXi-feng laughed. \n\n‘All right. I’ll tell Bao-yu tomorrow to get someone else and I’ll take this girl. But I wonder if she would be willing?’ \n\nCrimson laughed. \n\n‘Willing or not isn’t for us to say. But we should certainly learn a lot from being with you, ma’am — the proper way to do things and how to behave in company. We should get to know about the ways of the world.’ \n\nWhile she was speaking, one of Lady Wang’s maids arrived to ask Xi-feng if she would go over. She excused herself to Li Wan and went off. Crimson returned to Green Delights. But our narrative does not follow her. \n\nLet us return to Dai-yu, who, having been kept awake a long time the previous night by her worries, overslept. When she got up next morning, she heard that all the girls were already in the garden for the Feast of the Farewell to the Flowers and, fearing that she might be laughed at for her laziness, hurriedly completed her toilet and went out. She was on the point of leaving the courtyard when Bao-yu appeared. He accosted her with a smile. \n\n‘Coz, did you tell on me yesterday? You’ve had me worried about it all night.’ \n\nDai-yu turned back to Nightingale and issued some instructions about the room: \n\n‘Put the portière down. And when the swallows come back, let the blind down and use the lion to hold it. Then light the incense and put the cover on the burner.’ \n\nAs she said this, she continued on her way out of the courtyard. Bao-yu, assuming that her coldness was on account of what had happened the previous afternoon, was as yet quite unaware of last night’s incident. He bowed to her repeatedly as she swept past him, but she took no more notice of him than if he had not been there and went off to look for the other girls. \n\nBao-yu was nonplussed. \n\n‘This doesn’t look like yesterday’s business,’ he thought. ‘But I got back too late to see her last night, so I can’t have offended her in any other way.’ \n\nAs he reflected, he could not help following after her. \n\nHe saw Bao-chai and Tan-chun standing ahead of him watching the dancing cranes. When Dai-yu came up, the three of them stood talking together. Then, seeing him approach, Tan-chun laughed. \n\n‘Here comes Cousin Bao! Better late than never!’ \n\nBao-yu smiled. \n\n‘How are you, coz? I was asking after you the other day when I saw Cousin Wan.’ \n\n‘Come over here, Bao,’ said Tan-chun. ‘I want to talk to you.’ \n\nBao-yu went over willingly, and Tan-chun led him off under a pomegranate-tree away from the other two. \n\n‘Has Uncle been at you these last few days?’ she asked him. \n\nBao-yu laughed. \n\n‘No. Not the last few days.’ \n\n‘I heard a rumour yesterday that he had sent for you.’ \n\n‘That must have been a mistake,’ said Bao-yu. ‘No one sent for me.’ \n\n‘I’ve saved up another ten strings of cash these last few months,’ said Tan-chun. ‘Take it, will you? Next time you go out, you can buy me some more of those nice painted fans or little carved curiosities you bought last time.’ \n\n‘Oh, I’ve combed all the temples and bazaars inside and outside the city,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and I’ve not seen anything really novel or choice. All you can buy is things made of gold or jade or bronze or china that nobody wants because they’ve nowhere to put them — or else bits of silk or clothing or food.’ \n\n‘Who wants that sort of thing?’ said Tan-chun. ‘What I want is the sort of thing you bought last time: little willow-wood baskets, and tiny incense-boxes carved out of bamboo-root, and miniature stoves made of clay. Things like that. I was absolutely delighted with them. It seems the others were, too, because they snapped them up and kept them as treasures.’ \n\n‘Oh, if you want that sort of thing,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it’s easy. A few strings of cash will buy a cartload of them.’ \n\n‘The boys wouldn’t know what to get,’ said Tan-chun. ‘You must pick them out for me. Get me some more of those interesting, unpretentious little things — not too many, but a few more like the ones you bought last time. And I shall embroider another pair of slippers for you.’\n\n“That pair took even more work. What would he have said to that?”\n\n“Talking of shoes reminds me of a story,” said Baoyu. “Once when I was wearing them I happened to run into my father, and he wasn’t at all pleased. ‘Who made them?’ he asked. Of course I didn’t dare tell him it was Third Sister. I explained that my aunt had given them to me for my birthday the other day. When he heard that, he couldn’t very well say anything; but after a while he told me it was a shame to waste so much labour and good material on things like that. When I passed this on to Xiren, she said, ‘That’s nothing. Concubine Zhao is complaining like mad. “Her own full brother,” she fumes, “has no one to see to his shoes and socks, yet she spends her time making things like that.”’”\n\nTanchun’s face clouded. “Did she really say that? How utterly ridiculous! As if I were the one to make shoes for him! Doesn’t Huan get his allowance? He has clothes, shoes, socks and a whole houseful of maids and serving-women. What has she to complain of? And to whom? When I’ve time on my hands I may make a pair of shoes for fun — for any brother or cousin I choose. No one can stop me. She’s just talking nonsense.”\n\nBaoyu nodded. “You don’t understand. Naturally she has her own reasons.”\n\nThis provoked an outburst of anger from Tanchun. She tossed her head.\n\n“You’re being ridiculous too. Of course she has her reasons — low, mean, disgusting reasons. She can think what she likes. All I recognize are Lord Zheng and Lady Wang. I don’t care about anyone else. It’s the same with brothers and sisters. I’m nice to those who are nice to me. I’ve never distinguished between those by the first wife and concubines. I know I shouldn’t say this, but she’s so stupid and unreasonable. There’s another funny story. The other day when I gave you that money to buy playthings for me, a couple of days later she saw me and started complaining how hard up she was and how worried. I took no notice. But later, when the maids had gone, she started grumbling that the money I’d saved was given to you to spend instead of to Huan. When I heard that I didn’t know whether to laugh or lose my temper. I simply walked off and went to see Lady Wang.”\n\nJust then Baochai called laughingly from the other side, “Have you finished your talk? It’s all very well for a brother and sister to chat, but you might have some consideration for other people instead of keeping your secrets to yourselves. Can’t we join in too?”\n\nAt that Tanchun and Baoyu rejoined the others.\n\nBaoyu, missing Daiyu, knew that she must have slipped away somewhere else. He decided to wait a couple of days until her anger had cooled before going to see her. Then looking down he saw the fallen red blossoms of pomegranate and balsam carpeting the ground.\n\n“She’s so upset, she’s not even bothering to gather up the flowers,” he sighed. “I’ll take them to her and try to have it out with her tomorrow.”\n\nAs he was scooping them up into the skirt of his gown, he saw Baochai and the others set off back. She called over her shoulder:\n\n“Aren’t you coming?”\n\n“I’m just coming,” he answered.\n\nBut instead of following them he made his way over hills and streams, through trees and flowers, in the direction of the mound where he had helped bury the peach-blossom with Daiyu a few days earlier. Just before rounding the hill by the flower’s grave, he heard the sound of sobbing on the other side. Someone was lamenting and weeping there in a heart-rending manner.\n\n“Some maid’s been badly treated and come here to cry,” he thought. “I wonder which one it is.”\n\nHe halted to listen. And this is what he heard:\n\nAs blossoms fade and fly across the sky,\n\nWho pities the faded red, the scent that has been?\n\nSoftly the gossamer floats over spring pavilions,\n\nGently the willow fluff wafts to the embroidered screen.\n\nA girl in her chamber mourns the passing of spring,\n\nNo relief from anxiety her poor heart knows;\n\nHoe in hand, through the silken hangings she ventures,\n\nUnwilling to trample on blooms which come and go.\n\nWillows and elms are fresh and fragrant,\n\nBut peach and plum are blown away, to bloom another day.\n\nBut next year, when the peach and plum trees bloom again,\n\nWhich of her maidens will be missing from the women’s quarters?\n\nBy the third month the scented nests are built,\n\nBut the swallows on the beam are heartless all;\n\nNext year, though they may peck the buds once more,\n\nTheir nest may fall, the beam remain, but tenantless?\n\nFor three hundred and sixty days each year\n\nThe cutting wind and biting frost contend.\n\nHow long can beauty stay fresh and fair?\n\nOnce blown away, it becomes hard to find.\n\nBlooms are easy to see, but fallen petals are hard to find;\n\nBeside the steps her heart is breaking for the flowers.\n\nHoe in hand, her tears fall secretly,\n\nSpilling like drops of blood on the bare boughs.\n\nAt dusk, when the cuckoos are silent,\n\nShe returns with her hoe and closes the double door;\n\nAs the lamp casts her shadow on the wall,\n\nShe falls asleep to the cold patter of rain against the window.\n\nWhy is it that in others’ grief such sadness lies?\n\nPart from love of spring, part from anger with spring;\n\nFor suddenly it comes and suddenly goes,\n\nArriving without warning, leaving without a word.\n\nLast night outside the courtyard drifted a mournful song —\n\nWas it the soul of flowers or the soul of birds?\n\nHard to detain, the soul of flowers or birds,\n\nFor flowers have no assurance, birds no words.\n\nI pray that on the wings of the wind\n\nI may follow the flowers to heaven’s end.\n\nHeaven’s end! Where can the fragrant burial mound be found?\n\nBetter shroud the fair petals in silk\n\nWith clean earth for their aromatic tomb.\n\nThus pure you come and pure shall go,\n\nNot sinking into some foul ditch along the way.\n\nNow you are dead, and I have come to bury you.\n\nNone has divined the day when I shall die;\n\nMen laugh at me for burying fallen flowers,\n\nBut who will bury me when dead I lie?\n\nSee, when spring draws to a close and flowers fall,\n\nThis is the season when beauty must ebb and fade;\n\nThe day that spring takes wing and beauty fades\n\nWho will care for the fallen blossom or dead maid?"
