  "original": "话说贾政去见节度，进去了半日，不见出来，外头议论不一。李十儿在外也打听不出什么事来，便想到报上的饥荒，实在也着急。好不容易听见贾政出来了，便迎上来跟着，等不得回去，在无人处便问：“老爷进去这半天，有什么要紧的事？”贾政笑道：“并没有事。只为镇海总制是这位大人的亲戚，有书来嘱托照应我，所以说了些好话。又说：‘我们如今也是亲了。’”李十儿听得，心内喜欢，不免又壮了些胆子，便竭力怂恿贾政许这亲事。\n　　贾政心想薛蟠的事，到底有什么挂碍，在外头信息不通，难以打点。故回到本任来便打发家人进京打听，顺便将总制求亲之事回明贾母，如若愿意，即将三姑娘接到任所。家人奉命，赶到京中回明了王夫人，便在吏部打听得贾政并无处分，惟将署太平县的这位老爷革职。即写了禀帖，安慰了贾政，然后住着等信。\n　　且说薛姨妈为着薛蟠这件人命官司，各衙门内不知花了多少银钱，才定了误杀具题。原打量将当铺折变给人，备银赎罪，不想刑部驳审。又托人花了好些钱，总不中用，依旧定了个死罪，监着守候秋天大审。薛姨妈又气又疼，日夜啼哭。宝钗虽时常过来劝解，说是：“哥哥本来没造化，承受了祖父这些家业，就该安安顿顿的守着过日子。在南边已经闹的不象样，便是香菱那件事情就了不得，因为仗着亲戚们的势力，花了些银钱，这算白打死了一个公子。哥哥就该改过，做起正经人来，也该奉养母亲才是，不想进了京仍是这样。妈妈为他不知受了多少气，哭掉了多少眼泪。给他娶了亲，原想大家安安逸逸的过日子，不想命该如此，偏偏娶的嫂子又是一个不安静的，所以哥哥躲出门去。真正俗语说的，‘冤家路儿狭’，不多几天就闹出人命来了。妈妈和二哥哥也算不得不尽心的了，花了银钱不算，自己还求三拜四的谋干。无奈命里应该，也算自作自受。大凡养儿女是为着老来有靠，便是小户人家，还要挣一碗饭养活母亲，那里有将现成的闹光了，反害的老人家哭的死去活来的？不是我说，哥哥的这样行为，不是儿子，竟是个冤家对头。妈妈再不明白，明哭到夜，夜哭到明，又受嫂子的气。我呢，又不能常在这里劝解。我看见妈妈这样，那里放得下心！他虽说是傻，也不肯叫我回去。前儿老爷打发人回来说，看见京报，唬的了不得，所以才叫人来打点的。我想哥哥闹了事，担心的人也不少。幸亏我还是在跟前的一样，若是离乡调远，听见了这个信，只怕我想妈妈也就想杀了。我求妈妈暂且养养神，趁哥哥的活口现在，问问各处的账目。人家该咱们的，咱们该人家的，亦该请个旧伙计来算一算，看看还有几个钱没有。”薛姨妈哭看说道：“这几天为闹你哥哥的事，你来了，不是你劝我，就是我告诉你衙门的事。你还不知道：京里官商的名字已经退了，两个当铺已经给了人家，银子早拿来使完了。还有一个当铺，管事的逃了，亏空了好几千两银子，也夹在里头打官司。你二哥哥天天在外头要账，料着京里的账已经去了几万银子，只好拿南边公分里银子和住房折变才够。前两天还听见一个荒信，说是南边的公分当铺也因为折了本儿收了。要是这么着，你娘的命可就活不成了！”说着，又大哭起来。宝钗也哭着劝道：“银钱的事，妈妈操心也不中用，还有二哥哥给我们料理。单可恨这些伙计们，见咱们的势头儿败了，各自奔各自的去也罢了，我还听见说带着人家来挤我们的讹头。可见我哥哥活了这么大，交的人总不过是些个酒肉弟兄，急难中是一个没有的。妈妈要是疼我，听我的话，有年纪的人自己保重些。妈妈这一辈子，想来还不至挨冻受饿。家里这点子衣裳家伙，只好任凭嫂子去，那是没法儿的了。所有的家人老婆们，瞧他们也没心在这里了，该去的叫他们去。只可怜香菱苦了一辈子，只好跟着妈妈。实在短什么，我要是有的，还可以拿些个来，料我们那个也没有不依的。就是袭姑娘也是心术正道的，他听见咱们家的事，他倒提起妈妈来就哭。我们那一个还打量没事的，所以不大着急，要听见了，也是要唬个半死儿的。”薛姨妈不等说完，便说：“好姑娘，你可别告诉他。他为一个林姑娘几乎没要了命，如今才好了些。要是他急出个原故来，不但你添一层烦恼，我越发没了依靠了。”宝钗道：“我也是这么想，所以总没告诉他。”\n　　正说着，只听见金桂跑来外间屋里哭喊道：“我的命是不要的了！男人呢，已经是没有活的分儿了。咱们如今索性闹一闹，大伙儿到法场上去拼一拼！”说着，便将头往隔断板上乱撞，撞的披头散发。气的薛姨妈白瞪着两只眼，一句话也说不出来。还亏了宝钗嫂子长嫂子短，好一句歹一句的劝他。金桂道：“姑奶奶，如今你是比不得头里的了。你两口儿好好的过日子，我是个单身人儿，要脸做什么！”说着，就要跑到街上回娘家去。亏了人还多，拉住了，又劝了半天方住。把个宝琴唬的再不敢见他。若是薛蝌在家，他便抹粉施脂，描眉画鬓，奇情异致的打扮收拾起来，不时打从薛蝌住房前过，或故意咳嗽一声，明知薛蝌在屋里，特问房里是谁。有时遇见薛蝌，他便妖妖调调、娇娇痴痴的问寒问暖，忽喜忽嗔。丫头们看见都连忙躲开，他自己也不觉得，只是一心一意要弄的薛蝌感情时，好行宝蟾之计。那薛蝌却只躲着，有时遇见也不敢不周旋他，倒是怕他撒泼放刁的意思。更加金桂一则为色迷心，越瞧越爱，越想越幻，那里还看的出薛蝌的真假来？只有一宗，他见薛蝌有什么东西都是托香菱收着，衣服缝洗也是香菱，两个人偶然说话，他来了，急忙散开，一发动了一个“醋”字。欲待发作薛蝌，却是舍不得，只得将一腔隐恨都搁在香菱身上。却又恐怕闹了香菱得罪了薛蝌，倒弄的隐忍不发。\n　　一日，宝蟾走来，笑嘻嘻的向金桂道：“奶奶，看见了二爷没有？”金桂道：“没有。”宝蟾笑道：“我说二爷的那种假正经是信不得的。咱们前儿送了酒去，他说不会喝，刚才我见他到太太那屋里去，脸上红扑扑儿的一脸酒气。奶奶不信，回来只在咱们院子门口儿等他。他打那边过来，奶奶叫住他问问，看他说什么。”金桂听了，一心的恼意，便道：“他那里就出来了呢。他既无情义，问他作什么？”宝蟾道：“奶奶又迂了。他好说，咱们也好说；他不好说，咱们再另打主意。”金桂听着有理，因叫宝蟾：“瞧着他，看他出去了。”宝蟾答应着出来，金桂却去打开镜奁，又照了一照，把嘴唇儿又抹了一抹。然后拿一条洒花绢子，才要出来，又象忘了什么的，心里倒不知怎么是好了。只听宝蟾外面说道：“二爷今日高兴啊。那里喝了酒来了？”金桂听了，明知是叫他出来的意思，连忙掀起帘子出来。\n只见薛蝌和宝蟾说道：“今日是张大爷的好日子，所以被他们强不过，吃了半钟。到这时候脸还发烧呢。”一句话没说完，金桂早接口道：“自然人家外人的酒，比咱们自己家里的酒是有趣儿的。”薛蝌被他拿话一激，脸越红了，连忙走过来陪笑道：“嫂子说那里的话？”宝蟾见他二人交谈，便躲到屋里去了。这金桂初时原要假意发作薛蝌两句，无奈一见他两颊微红，双眸带涩，别有一种谨愿可怜之意，早把自己那骄悍之气，感化到爪洼国去了，因笑说道：“这么说，你的酒是硬强着才肯喝的呢。”薛蝌道：“我那里喝得来？”金桂道：“不喝也好，强如象你哥哥喝出乱子来，明儿娶了你们奶奶儿，象我这样守活寡受孤单呢！”说到这里，两个眼已经乜斜了，两腮上也觉红晕了。薛蝌见这话越发邪僻了，打算着要走。金桂也看出来了，那里容得，早已走过来一把拉住。薛蝌急了道：“嫂子放尊重些。”说着浑身乱颤。金桂索性老着脸道：“你只管进来，我和你说一句要紧的话。”\n　　正闹着，忽听背后一个人道：“奶奶！香菱来了。”把金桂唬了一跳。回头瞧时，却是宝蟾掀着帘子看他二人的光景，一抬头见香菱从那边来了，赶忙知会金桂。金桂这一惊不小，手已松了。薛蝌得便脱身跑了。那香菱正走着，原不理会，忽听宝蟾一嚷，才瞧见金桂在那里拉住薛蝌，住里死拽。香菱却唬的心头乱跳，自己连忙转身回去。这里金桂早已连吓带气，呆呆的瞅着薛蝌去了，怔了半天，恨了一声，自己扫兴归房。从此把香菱恨入骨髓。那香菱本是要到宝琴那里，刚走出腰门，看见这般，吓回去了。\n　　是日，宝钗在贾母屋里，听得王夫人告诉老太太要聘探春一事。贾母说道：“既是同乡的人，很好。只是听见说那孩子到过我们家里，怎么你老爷没有提起？”王夫人道：“连我们也不知道。”贾母道：“好是好，但只道儿太远。虽然老爷在那里，倘或将来老爷调任，可不是我们孩子太单了吗？”王夫人道：“两家都是做官的，也是拿不定。或者那边还调进来，即不然，终有个叶落归根。况且老爷既在那里做官，上司已经说了，好意思不给么？想来老爷的主意定了，只是不敢做主，故遣人来回老太太的。”贾母道：“你们愿意更好，但是三丫头这一去了，不知三年两年那边可能回家？若再迟了，恐怕我赶不上再见他一面了。”说着掉下泪来。王夫人道：“孩子们大了，少不得总要给人家的。就是本乡本土的人，除非不做官还使得，要是做官的，谁保的住总在一处？只要孩子们有造化就好。譬如迎姑娘倒配的近呢，偏时常听见他和女婿打闹，甚至于不给饭吃。就是我们送了东西去，他也摸不着。近来听见益发不好了，也不放他回来。两口子拌起来，就说咱们使了他家的银钱，可怜这孩子总不得个出头的日子。前儿我掂记他，打发人去瞧他，迎丫头藏在耳房里，不肯出来。老婆们必要进去，看见我们姑娘这样冷天还穿着几件旧衣裳。他一包眼泪的告诉老婆们说：‘回去别说我这么苦，这也是我命里所招！也不用送什么衣裳东西来，不但摸不着，反要添一顿打，说是我告诉的。’老太太想想，这倒是近处眼见的，若不好，更难受。倒亏了大太太也不理会他，大老爷也不出个头。如今迎姑娘实在比我们三等使唤的丫头还不及。我想探丫头虽不是我养的，老爷既看见过女婿，定然是好才许的。只请老太太示下，择个好日子，多派几个人送到他老爷任上，该怎么着，老爷也不肯将就。”贾母道：“有他老子作主，你就料理妥当，拣个长行的日子送去，也就定了一件事。”王夫人答应着“是”。宝钗听的明白，也不敢则声，只是心里叫苦：“我们家的姑娘们就算他是个尖儿。如今又要远嫁，眼看着这里的人一天少似一天了。”见王夫人起身告辞出去，他也送出来了。一径回到自己房中，并不与宝玉说知，见袭人独自一个做活，便将听见的话说了。袭人也很不受用。\n　　却说赵姨娘听见探春这事，反喜欢起来，心里说道：“我这个丫头在家忒瞧不起我，我何从还是个娘？比他的丫头还不济。况且上水，护着别人。他挡在头里，连环儿也不得出头。如今老爷接了去，我倒干净。想要他孝敬我不能够了，只愿意他象迎丫头似的，我也称称愿。”一面想着，一面跑到探春那边与他道喜，说：“姑娘，你是要高飞的人了。到了姑爷那边自然比家里还好，想来你也是愿意的。就是养了你一场，并没有借你的光儿。就是我有七分不好，也有三分的好，也别说一去了把我搁在脑杓子后头。”探春听着毫无道理，只低头作活，一句也不言语。赵姨娘见他不理，气忿忿的自己去了。\n　　这里探春又气又笑又伤心，也不过自己掉泪而已。坐了一回，闷闷的走到宝玉这边来。宝玉问道：“三妹妹，我听见林妹妹死的时候，你在那里来着。我还听见说：林妹妹死的时候，远远的有音乐之声。或者他是有来历的，也未可知。”探春笑道：“那是你心里想着罢了。但只那夜却怪，不象人家鼓乐的声儿，你的话或者也是。”宝玉听了，更以为实。又想前日自己神魂飘荡之时，曾见一人，说是黛玉生不同人，死不同鬼，必是那里的仙子临凡。又想起那年唱戏做的嫦娥，飘飘艳艳，何等风致。过了一回探春去了，因必要紫鹃过来，立刻回了贾母去叫他。无奈紫鹃心里不愿意，虽经贾母王夫人派了过来，自己没法，却是在宝玉跟前，不是嗳声就是叹气的。宝玉背地里拉着他，低声下气要问黛玉的话，紫鹃从没好话回答。宝钗倒背地里夸他有忠心，并不嗔怪他。那雪雁虽是宝玉娶亲这夜出过力的，宝玉见他心地不甚明白，便回了贾母、王夫人，将他配了一个小厮，各自过活去了。王奶妈养着他将来好送黛玉的灵枢回南。鹦哥等小丫头，仍旧伏侍老太太。\n　　宝玉本想念黛玉，因此及彼，又想跟黛玉的人已经云散，更加纳闷。闷到无可如何，忽又想黛玉死的这样清楚，必是离凡返仙去了，反又欢喜。忽然听见袭人和宝钗那里讲究探春出嫁之事，宝玉听了，“啊呀”的一声，哭倒在炕上。唬得宝钗袭人都来扶起，说：“怎么了？”宝玉早哭的说不出来。定了一回子神，说道：“这日子过不得了，我姊妹们都一个一个的散了！林妹妹是成了仙去了。大姐姐呢，已经死了。这也罢了，没天天在一块儿。二姐姐碰着了一个混账不堪的东西。三妹妹又要远嫁，总不得见的了。史妹妹又不知要到那里去。薛妹妹是有了人家儿的。这些姐姐妹妹，难道一个都不留在家里，单留我做什么？”袭人忙又拿话解劝。宝钗摆着手说：“你不用劝他，等我问他。”因问着宝玉道：“据你的心里，要这些姐妹都在家里陪到你老了，都不为终身的事吗？要说别人，或者还有别的想头。你自己的姐姐妹妹，不用说没有远嫁的，就是有，老爷作主，你有什么法儿？打量天下就是你一个人爱姐姐妹妹呢？要是都象你，就连我也不能陪着你了。大凡人念书原为的是明理，怎么你越念越糊涂了呢。这么说起来，我和袭姑娘各自一边儿去，让你把姐姐妹妹们都邀了来守着你。”宝玉听了，两只手拉住宝钗、袭人道：“我也知道。为什么散的这么早呢？等我化了灰的时候再散也不迟。”袭人掩着他的嘴道：“又胡说了。才这两天身上好些，二奶奶才吃些饭。你要是又闹翻了，我也不管了。”宝玉听他两个人说话都有道理，只是心上不知道怎么着才好，只得说道：“我却明白，但只是心里闹得慌。”宝钗也不理他，暗叫袭人快把定心丸给他吃了，慢慢的开导他。袭人便欲告诉探春，说临行不必来辞。宝钗道：“这怕什么？等消停几日，他心里明白了，还要叫他们多说句话儿呢。况且三姑娘是极明白的人，不象那些假惺惺的人，少不得有一番箴谏，他以后就不是这样了。”正说着，贾母那边打发过鸳鸯来说：“知道宝玉旧病又发，叫袭人劝说安慰，叫他不用胡思乱想。”袭人等应了。鸳鸯坐了一会子去了。\n    那贾母又想起探春远行，虽不全备妆奁，其一应动用之物俱该预备，便把凤姐叫来，将老爷的主意告诉了一遍，叫他料理去。凤姐答应。\n不知怎么办理，下回分解。",
  "translation": "After Jia Zheng had gone to see the military governor, he was inside for a long time and did not emerge, so that outside the rumours were flying. Li Shi’er could not find out what was happening and, thinking of the newspaper report, was very worried. At long last Jia Zheng came out and Li Shi’er hurried forward to meet him. Unable to wait until they were back, he asked as soon as they were alone:\n\n“What was the important business that kept you so long in there, sir?”\n\nJia Zheng smiled.\n\n“It was nothing. It’s just that the new governor is a relative of this gentleman and had written asking him to help me, so he said some kind things. He also said, ‘Now we are related by marriage too.’”\n\nThis delighted Li Shi’er and made him bolder. He did his best to urge Jia Zheng to consent to the match.\n\nJia Zheng, however, was thinking, “There may be some hitch over Xue Pan’s business. Cut off from news outside, it’s hard for me to handle.” So upon his return he sent a servant to the capital to make inquiries and at the same time to report the governor’s proposal to the Lady Dowager. If she approved, Third Sister could be sent to his post. The servant, having received his orders, hurried to the capital and reported to Lady Wang. Then he went to the Board of Civil Office to find out whether Jia Zheng had been punished, and learned that only the former acting magistrate of Taiping County had been dismissed. He wrote a letter to reassure Jia Zheng and stayed on to wait for news.\n\nAunt Xue, on account of Xue Pan’s charge of manslaughter, had spent no one knew how much money in all the yamens before the charge was accepted. She had planned to mortgage her pawnshop to raise the silver needed to redeem his punishment, but the Board of Punishments had called for a retrial. Then, although she spent more money and enlisted help, it was no use: he was sentenced to death and imprisoned to await the autumn assizes. Furious and frantic, she wept day and night. Although Baochai often came over to console her, saying:\n\n“Cousin Pan was born unlucky. After inheriting so much property from his grandfather he should have lived quietly and steadily. He made enough trouble down south, and that business with Xiangling was shocking. Because he counted on the influence of his relatives and spent some money, a young gentleman was beaten to death for nothing. He should have turned over a new leaf and become a steady, respectable man to support you, mother; instead, even after coming to the capital he carried on as before. How much anger and how many tears has he cost you! You found him a wife in the hope that you could live in peace; but as fate decreed, the wife you chose him is another termagant, so that he had to get away from home. And as the proverb says, ‘Enemies are fated to meet.’ In a few days he was in trouble again, charged with manslaughter. You and Cousin Ke have done all you possibly could. You’ve spent money, and you’ve begged for help high and low; but this is fated too, he’s only reaping as he sowed. Most people count on their children for support in old age; even in a poor family a son will work to keep his mother. How can he squander all he has and reduce his old mother to such desperate grief? I don’t like to say it, but the way he’s behaved makes him not a son but a nemesis! If you, mother, go on blinding yourself to this, weeping all day and all night, you’ll only be bullied by my sister-in-law too. And I can’t often be here to reason with you. When I see how you’re suffering, how can I not be worried? Although he’s a fool, he wouldn’t agree to my coming back. The other day, on the strength of a report in the capital gazette, my father-in-law sent a man here in a panic to try to fix things; so I know that a lot of people are worried by Pan’s trouble. Luckily I’m still close by. If I’d gone far away and heard this news, I’d have been worried to death about you, mother. I beg you, while he’s still alive, to pull yourself together and check the accounts of all the firms — how much is owed to us and how much we owe other people. We should ask one of the old assistants to take charge.\n\nXiren told a maid to go and fetch Jia Lian. “Please ask him to come over, there’s something I’d like his help with.”\n\nThe maid returned to say, “Master Lian says he can’t come just now as he’s busy. If there’s anything you want done, madam, you can tell him later.”\n\nAunt Xue paid the servants for their purchases and saw that they had a meal. Then, thinking of Xue Ke, she sent to ask why he had not come back. The servant returned to report, “Master Ke has someone with him and is busy with accounts. He says if you need money for anything, madam, he’ll see to it presently.”\n\n“Tell the steward to come and settle accounts,” she ordered. “We want to see how much money is left.”\n\nWeeping, Aunt Xue told Baochai, “Since you came back, what with your advice and my telling you about the court case, you’ve been so busy over your brother’s affairs you don’t know the latest developments. The name of our firm in the capital has been withdrawn, and the two pawnshops have been made over to others — the money from them was used up long ago. The manager of the third pawnshop has absconded with thousands of taels, and we’re involved in a lawsuit over that. Your second brother goes out every day to collect debts. I gather tens of thousands of taels are owed us here in the capital, but we’ll have to raise the money by selling our property in the south and this house of ours. A couple of days ago I heard a wild rumour that the southern branch of our pawnshop has closed down too because of losses. If that’s true, your mother’s done for!” She broke down again and sobbed.\n\nBaochai, also in tears, tried to comfort her. “What’s the use of worrying about money, mother? Let Second Brother see to it. The hateful thing is the way our assistants, now that we’re in trouble, are deserting us; and I’ve even heard that some are putting pressure on us to pay compensation. This shows that all my brother’s life he made friends who were only drinking companions, not one true friend to help out in a crisis. If you love me, mother, do listen to me and take better care of yourself in your old age. I don’t think you’ll ever have to go cold or hungry. As for the clothes and things in the house, we’ll just have to let my sister-in-law take them — there’s no help for it. All the servants, I can see, have no heart to stay on; we should tell those who want to leave to go. The only pity is that Xiangling has had a wretched life and will have to stay with you. If you’re short of anything, I can let you have what I have, and I’m sure my husband won’t object. And Xiren is a good girl too. When she heard of our trouble she cried at the very mention of you. My husband, imagining all’s well, isn’t too worried; but if he knew the truth, he’d be scared half to death.”\n\nBefore she could finish, Aunt Xue interposed, “Don’t tell him, my dear. He nearly died on account of Miss Lin, and he’s only just beginning to get over it. If he has a relapse from anxiety, that would add to your troubles and I’d have no one to turn to.”\n\n“That’s what I thought, mother, which is why I haven’t told him.”\n\nAs they were talking, Jingui burst into the outer room.\n\n“I don’t care if I die!” she shrieked. “My husband’s done for anyway. Let’s make a clean sweep and all go to the execution ground to fight it out!” She dashed her head against the partition, her hair tumbling loose, until Aunt Xue was speechless with rage and could only glare. Luckily Baochai with many soothing words eventually calmed her down.\n\n“You’re not in my shoes, young madam,” Jingui ranted. “You and your husband live happily together, but I’m a widow, what do I care about face?” She threatened to go back to her parents, and it took several servants to restrain her. After much persuasion she quietened down, but Baoqin was so frightened that she dared not see her.\n\nWhen Xue Ke was at home, Jingui would powder her face, rouge her lips, pencil her eyebrows and dress her hair in the most seductive way. She would often stroll past his room, cough intentionally or call out to ask who was there if she knew he was in. If she met him she would simper and ask solicitously after his health, or flush and pout coquettishly. The maids, avoiding her, were disgusted by her behaviour; but she, intent only on seducing Xue Ke, was quite unconscious of their disgust.\n\nWhenever Ke came her way, Moon Toad would try the same trick on him as she had on Xue Pan. He did his best to avoid her, and when they did meet he dared not be less than civil, for fear she might make a scene. And Jin-gui, in her blind infatuation, was so enchanted by him that she failed to see through his feigned response. There was only one thing that bothered her. She noticed that he left everything with Caltrop for safe-keeping, and that she also did his sewing and washing. If the two of them were talking together and she appeared, they would immediately break off their conversation. This aroused her jealousy. She would have liked to vent her anger on Xue Ke, but could not bring herself to, and was obliged to bottle up her resentment and take it out on Caltrop. She was afraid, however, that if she picked on Caltrop she might offend Xue Ke, and so she felt compelled to hold herself in check.\n\nOne day Moon Toad came into her room and asked with a sly smile:\n\n‘Have you seen Master Ke, ma’am?’\n\n‘No.’\n\n‘I said all that show of respectability was a fraud! The other day we sent him some wine, and he claimed he didn’t drink. Just now I saw him coming back from Her Ladyship’s apartment, and his face was bright red and reeking of wine. If you don’t believe me, ma’am, wait for him at our gate. When he comes by, call him and ask him. See what he says!’\n\nJin-gui was thoroughly irritated by this piece of information.\n\n‘He won’t be coming out yet. If he’s so heartless, why should I bother to ask?’\n\n‘Don’t be so unbending, ma’am!’ said Moon Toad. ‘If he gives a straight answer, well and good. If not, we can think of something else.’\n\nThis sounded sensible to Jin-gui, and she told Moon Toad to keep watch and inform her when Xue Ke came out. Moon Toad went out to take up her post, while Jin-gui opened her dressing-case and studied her reflection in the mirror, touching up her lips. Then she picked up a flowered silk handkerchief and was about to go out, when she suddenly seemed at a loss, as if she had forgotten something. She heard Moon Toad’s voice outside:\n\n‘You seem very cheerful today, Master Ke! Been drinking somewhere?’\n\nJin-gui knew that this was her cue to make an entrance, and lifted the door-curtain to go out.\n\nShe heard Xue Ke say to Moon Toad:\n\n‘It’s Mr Zhang’s birthday today. They rather forced me into drinking a glass. I can still feel my face burning.’\n\nBefore he could finish, Jin-gui cut in:\n\n‘I see! So wine tastes better when it comes from an outsider!’\n\nStung by her remark, Xue Ke blushed an even deeper shade of red and came up to her at once with an ingratiating smile.\n\n‘Please, sister! What do you mean?’\n\nMoon Toad, seeing that the two of them were engaged in conversation, slipped back into the house. Jin-gui had originally intended to pretend to be angry with Xue Ke and give him a piece of her mind. But now, seeing the faint flush on his cheeks and the rather bashful look in his eyes, she found him utterly charming, and her own harsh manner was completely disarmed. She smiled and said:\n\n‘So you had to be forced to drink it?’\n\n‘I can’t really drink at all,’ protested Xue Ke.\n\n‘Maybe it’s just as well,’ said Jin-gui. ‘Look at the trouble your cousin gets into when he drinks. And then his wife is left at home to languish in solitude!’\n\nAs she said this, her eyes became distinctly flirtatious and her cheeks flushed. Xue Ke could tell that she was leading up to something improper and was about to make his escape when she, guessing his intention, stepped forward and held him back by his jacket.\n\n‘Please, sister!’ he exclaimed in desperation. ‘Show some respect!’\n\nHe was trembling all over. She brazenly clung on to him.\n\n‘Come inside. There’s something important I want to say to you.’\n\nAs they were struggling like this, a voice behind them cried out:\n\n‘Ma’am! Caltrop’s here!’\n\nJin-gui started and turned to look. It was Moon Toad, holding up the door-curtain and spying on them.\n\nJust then Xiangling was seen approaching from the other direction, and Jin-gui hastily let go of Xue Ke, who made his escape. Xiangling, not noticing them until Baochan’s cry alerted her, was horrified to see Jin-gui dragging Xue Ke inside. Her heart pounding with fright she turned back.\n\nJin-gui, quite aghast, had stared stupidly after Xue Ke. After standing in a daze for some time, with an angry snort she went back disappointed to her room, from that day forth hating Xiangling to the marrow of her bones. Xiangling, who had been on her way to see Baoqin, turned back in consternation after this shock at the side gate.\n\nThat day Bacchai in the Lady Dowager’s room heard Lady Wang tell the old lady that they wanted to arrange a match for Tanchun.\n\n“Since he’s from the same district as us, that’s all right,” said the Lady Dowager. “But I hear the young man has called here. Why didn’t your husband mention it?”\n\n“We didn’t know either.”\n\n“It sounds all right, but it’s too far away. Although the Elder Master is posted there, if he’s transferred later, wouldn’t the child be all on her own?”\n\n“Both families are official families, so it’s hard to say,” replied Lady Wang. “Maybe he’ll be transferred to the capital. If not, finally he’s bound to return to his roots. Besides, as the Elder Master is his superior there and has made this proposal, it would look bad to turn it down. I think our master has made up his mind, but not venturing to decide himself he sent to ask for your instructions, madam.”\n\n“If you’re willing, that’s all right. But once Third Daughter goes there, it may be two or three years before she can come home. If it’s later than that, I may not live to see her again.” The old lady shed tears.\n\n“When children grow up they have to marry,” said Lady Wang. “Even if she married someone here, unless he’s not an official, who can guarantee that her husband won’t be transferred elsewhere? We must just hope that the child has good fortune. For instance, Yingchun’s marriage was to someone nearby, yet we keep hearing that her husband bullies her. They even deny her food. And when we send her things, she never gets them. Recently, we heard that things are worse. He won’t let her come home, and when they quarrel he accuses us of sponging on them. Poor child! She never has any day of respite. The other day, missing her, I sent women to see her. She hid in the servants’ quarters and refused to come out, but they insisted on going in. They found her wearing old clothes in this cold weather. With tears in her eyes she told them, ‘Don’t report how I’m suffering. This is my fate! Don’t send me any clothes or things either. Not only would I not get them, I’d be beaten for telling on them.’ Just think, madam, though she’s near at hand and we see this happening, if she’s badly treated we can do nothing. And now Lady Xing ignores her, while the Elder Master won’t intervene. Yingchun is actually worse off now than one of our third-grade maids. Although Tanchun isn’t my own child, as the master has seen the young man and given his consent he must be suitable. We just need your approval, madam, to choose a good day and send her with some escorts to her father’s yamen. He’s bound to make suitable arrangements for her.”\n\n“Since her father has decided, you can go ahead and make the preparations. Choose a day for her to set out, and that will settle it.”\n\n“Yes,” said Lady Wang.\n\nBaochai, who had taken this in, dared not say anything but thought in consternation, “She’s actually the best of all us girls in our household. Now she’s to marry so far away! There are fewer and fewer of us here.” When Lady Wang rose to take her leave, she saw her out.\n\nShe went straight back to her own room without telling Baoyu what she had heard. Finding Xiren there alone doing some sewing, she told her. Xiren was most upset.\n\nWhen Concubine Zhao heard the news of Tanchun’s betrothal, she was overjoyed.\n\n“That daughter of mine always looked down on me at home,” she thought. “What sort of mother have I been to her? Worse than one of her maids! Besides, she toadied to the others and shielded them, standing in my way so that even Huan couldn’t get ahead. Now that the master has arranged for her to marry so far away, good riddance! I can’t expect any favours from her. I only hope she’ll turn out like Yingchun — that would be fine!”\n\nWith these thoughts she hurried over to congratulate Tanchun.\n\n“So you’re going up in the world, miss,” she said. “Life with your husband will be better than at home, I’ve no doubt, and that’s what you’ve always wanted. Although I brought you up, I never got any credit for it. Even if I’m seventy per cent to blame, still I did some things well; so don’t forget me altogether once you’ve left.”\n\nTanchun, finding this outburst utterly unreasonable, simply lowered her head to her sewing without a word. Her silence enraged Concubine Zhao, who flounced off indignantly.\n\nTanchun herself felt both angry and amused, but most of all distressed. She could only shed tears in secret. After sitting by herself for a while she listlessly went to see Baoyu.\n\n“Third sister, I heard you were present when Cousin Lin died,” he said. “They say there was the sound of music in the distance. Who knows, maybe she had some supernatural origin.”\n\n“That’s just your imagination. Still, that night the music did sound rather unearthly, not like ordinary drums and trumpets. So there may be something in what you say.”\n\nThis confirmed Baoyu’s belief. He recalled how, during his trance, he had seen a man who told him that Daiyu was different from other mortals in life and in death too, and must have been some fairy. He remembered also how ethereal and lovely she had looked that year when made up as the goddess of the moon.... After a while, Tanchun left.\n\nAs he was eager to have Zijuan with him, he asked the Lady Dowager to send her to him. But Zijuan was unwilling and, although at the old lady’s and Lady Wang’s orders she had no choice, in Baoyu’s presence she was forever sighing. When he took her aside to ask meekly for news of Daiyu, she never gave him a good answer. Baochai, however, admiring her loyalty, did not take her to task for this.\n\nAlthough Xueyan had helped on the night of Baoyu’s wedding, he knew that she was rather simple-minded and so had asked his grandmother and mother to marry her to one of the younger servants. Nanny Wang was being kept to escort Daiyu’s coffin to the south. And Yingge and the other young maids had returned to the old lady’s service.\n\nBaoyu’s thoughts of Daiyu led him to reflect that all her attendants had scattered, which depressed him still more. Finally it occurred to him that, as she had died so clearly without delusion, she must have shed her mortal flesh and become an immortal; and this thought cheered him. Then suddenly he overheard Baochai and Xiren discussing Tanchun’s marriage. With a cry of dismay he collapsed on the kang.\n\nBaochai and Xiren in alarm helped him up.\n\n“What’s wrong?” they asked.\n\nHe was too overcome to answer. When he had calmed down a little he sobbed, “Life isn’t worth living! All my sisters and cousins are going away, one by one. Cousin Lin has become an immortal. Eldest Sister is dead. Well, we weren’t together every day even before. Second Sister has that beast of a husband. Now Third Sister’s marrying far away and I shall never see her again. Who knows where Cousin Shi will go? Cousin Xue is engaged....\n\n“Are you determined to keep none of your cousins at home, cousin?” he asked. “Why single me out to stay?”\n\nXiren tried to console him, but Baochai signed to her to desist.\n\n“Let me ask him something,” she said. “Tell me honestly, would you like all your girl cousins to stay at home to keep you company till you’re old, without getting married? Others may have other ideas, but at least none of your own sisters has been married far away. Even if they had been, with your father deciding it what could you do? Do you imagine you’re the only one fond of sisters? If everyone were like you, not even I could stay here to keep you company.\n\n“The whole point of studying is to learn reason. Why do you get more muddle-headed the more you study? In that case, Xiren and I had better move out, so that you can ask all your sisters to come and keep you company.”\n\nBaoyu caught hold of her and Xiren. “I know it’s unreasonable,” he said. “But why must we part so soon? Wait till I turn to ashes, then you can all disperse!”\n\nXiren put her hand over his mouth. “There you go talking nonsense again,” she scolded. “It’s only the last couple of days that you’ve been better and the young mistress has started eating a little. If you work yourself into a frenzy again, I won’t bother about you.”\n\nBaoyu knew that both of them were right, but he did not know how to calm the tumult in his heart. “I realize I’m being stupid,” he said. “But I can’t help feeling so upset.”\n\nBaochai ignored this and told Xiren quietly to give him the calming pills and reason with him later. Xiren was for telling Tanchun not to take her leave of him, but Baochai said:\n\n“There’s no need for that. After a few days when he’s calmed down, he’ll want to have a good talk with her. Besides, Third Sister’s so intelligent, not like those hypocrites. She’s bound to give him good advice which will cure him of this folly.”\n\nJust then Yuanyang arrived from the Lady Dowager who, having heard that Baoyu was in one of his old frenzied states again, had sent her to urge Xiren to reason with him and not let him brood. Yuanyang stayed a little while, then left.\n\nThe old lady also remembered that, although no full dowry need be prepared for Tanchun’s long journey, she must have all the daily necessities she required. So she sent for Xifeng and told her to make the preparations as Jia Zheng had instructed. Xifeng promised to see to it.\n\nTo know what happened later, read the following chapter."
