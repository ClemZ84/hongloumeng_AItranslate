  "original": "话说王夫人因见贾母那日在大观园不过着了些风寒，不是什么大病，请医生吃了两剂药也就好了，命凤姐来，吩咐他预备给贾政带送东西。正商议着，只见贾母打发人来叫，王夫人忙引着凤姐儿过来。王夫人又请问：“这会子可又觉大安些？”贾母道：“今日可大好了。方才你们送来野鸡崽子汤，我尝了一尝，倒有味儿，又吃了两块肉，心里很受用。”王夫人笑道：“这是凤丫头孝敬老太太的，算他的孝心虔，不枉了素日老太太疼他。”贾母点头笑道：“难为他想着。若是还有生的，再炸上两块，咸浸浸的，喝粥有味儿。那汤虽好，就只不对稀饭。”凤姐听了，连忙答应，命人到大厨房传话。\n　　这里贾母又向王夫人笑道：“我打发人找你来，不为别的，初二日是凤丫头的生日。上两年我原想着替他做生日，偏到跟前又有事就混过去了。今年人又齐全，料着又没事，咱们大家好生乐一天。”王夫人笑道：“我也想着呢。既是老太太高兴，何不就商议定了？”贾母笑道：“我想往年不拘谁做生日，都是各自送各自的礼，这个也俗了，也觉太生分。今儿我出个新法子，又不生分，又可以取乐儿。”王夫人忙道：“老太太怎么想着好，就是怎么样行。”贾母笑道：“我想着咱们也学那小家子，大家凑个分子，多少尽着这钱去办，你说好不好？”王夫人道：“这个很好，但不知怎么个凑法儿？”贾母听说，一发高兴起来，忙遣人去请薛姨妈邢夫人等，又叫请姑娘们并宝玉，和那府里的尤氏和赖大家的，及有些头脸管事的媳妇也都叫了来。众丫头婆子见贾母十分高兴，也都高兴，忙忙的各自分头去请的请，传的传。没顿饭工夫，老的少的，上的下的，乌压压挤了一屋子。只薛姨妈和贾母对坐，邢夫人王夫人只坐在房门前两张椅子上，宝钗姐妹等五六个人坐在炕上，宝玉坐在贾母怀前，底下满满的站了一地。贾母忙命拿几张小杌子来，给赖大母亲等几个高年有体面的嬷嬷坐了。贾府风俗，年高伏侍过父母的家人，比年轻的主子还有体面呢，所以尤氏凤姐等只管地下站着，那赖大的母亲等三四个老嬷嬷告了罪，都坐在小杌子上。\n    贾母笑着把方才一夕话说与众人听了，众人谁不凑这趣儿呢。再也有和凤姐儿好，情愿这样的。也有怕凤姐儿，巴不得奉承他的。况且都是拿的出来的，所以一闻此言都欣然应诺。贾母先道：“我出二十两。”薛姨妈笑道：“我随着老太太，也是二十两。”邢夫人王夫人笑道：“我们不敢和老太太并肩，自然矮一等，每人十六两罢了。”尤氏李纨也笑道：“我们自然又矮一等，每人十二两罢。”贾母忙和李纨道：“你寡妇失业的，那里还拉你出这个钱，我替你出了罢。”凤姐忙笑道：“老太太别高兴，且算一算账再揽事。老太太身上已有两分呢。这会子又替大嫂子出十二两，说着高兴，一会子回想又心疼了，过后儿又说：‘都是为凤丫头花了钱。’使个巧法子，哄着我拿出三四倍子来暗里补上，我还做梦呢！”说的众人都笑了。贾母笑道：“依你怎么样呢？”凤姐笑道：“生日没到，我这会子已经折受的不受用了。我一个钱也不出，惊动这些人，实在不安，不如大嫂子这分我替他出了罢。我到那一日多吃些东西，就享了福了。”邢夫人等听了，都说很是，贾母方允了。凤姐儿又笑道：“我还有一句话呢。我想老祖宗自己二十两，又有林妹妹宝兄弟的两分子；姨妈自己二十两，又有宝妹妹的一分子，这倒也公道。只是二位太太每位十六两，自己又少，又不替人出，这有些不公道。老祖宗吃了亏！”贾母听了，呵呵大笑道：“到底是我的凤丫头向着我，这说的很是。要不是你，我叫他们又哄了去了。”凤姐笑道：“老祖宗只把他哥儿两个交给两位太太，一位占一个罢，派每位替出一分就是了。”贾母忙说：“这很公道，就是这样。”赖大的母亲忙站起来笑道：“这可反了，我替二位太太生气！在那边是儿子媳妇，在这边是内侄女儿，倒不向着婆婆姑姑，倒向着别人，这儿媳妇倒成了陌路人，‘内’侄女儿倒成了‘外’侄女儿了！”说的贾母和众人都大笑起来了。\n　　赖大的母亲因又问道：“少奶奶们十二两，我们自然也该矮一等了？”贾母听说，道：“这使不得。你们虽该矮一等，我知道你们这几个都是财主，位虽低些，钱却比他们多。你们和他们一例才使得。“众嬷嬷听了，连忙答应。贾母又道：“姑娘们不过应个景儿，每人照一个月的月例就是了。”又回头叫鸳鸯来：“你们也凑几个人，商议凑了来。”鸳鸯答应着，去不多时，带了平儿、袭人、彩霞等，还有几个丫头来，也有二两的，也有一两的。贾母因问平儿：“你难道不替你主子做生日？还入在这里头？”平儿笑道：“我那个私自另外的有了，这是公中的，也该出一分。”贾母笑道：“这才是好孩子。”\n　　凤姐又笑道：“上下都全了，还有二位姨奶奶，他出不出也问一声儿。尽到他们是理，不然他们只当小看了他们了。”贾母听说，忙说：“可是呢。怎么倒忘了他们？只怕他们不得闲儿，叫个丫头问问去。”说着，早有丫头去了。半日回来说道：“每位也出二两。”贾母喜欢道：“拿笔砚来算明，共计多少。”尤氏因悄悄的骂凤姐道：“我把你这没足够的小蹄子儿，这么些婆婆婶子凑银子给你做生日，你还不够，又拉上两个苦瓠子。”凤姐也悄悄的笑道：“你少胡说，一会子离了这里，我才和你算账！他们两个为什么苦呢？有了钱也是白填还别人，不如拘了来咱们乐。”\n　　说着早已早已合了，共凑了一百五十两有零。贾母道：“一天戏酒用不了。”尤氏道：“既不请客，酒席又不多，两三日的用度都够了。头等，戏不用钱，省在这上头。”贾母道：“凤丫头说那一班好，就传那一班。”凤姐道：“咱们家的班子都听熟了，倒是花几个钱叫一班来听听罢。”贾母道：“这件事我交给珍哥媳妇了，越发叫凤丫头别操一点心儿，受用一日才算。”尤氏答应着。又说了一回话，都知贾母乏了，才浙渐的散出来。\n　　尤氏等送出邢夫人王夫人二人散去，因往凤姐房里来，商议怎么办生日的话。凤姐儿道：“你不用问我，你只看老太太的眼色儿行事就完了。”尤氏笑道：“你这么个阿物儿，也忒行了大运了。我当有什么事叫我们去，原来单为这个。出了钱不算，还叫我操心，你怎么谢我？”凤姐笑道：“别扯臊，我又没叫你来，谢你什么？你怕操心，你这会子就回老太太去，再派一个就是了。”尤氏笑道：“你瞧瞧，把他兴的这个样儿，我劝你收着些儿好，太满了就要流出来了。”二人又说了一回方散。\n　　次日，将银子送到宁国府来，尤氏方才起来梳洗，因问：“是谁送过来的？”丫头们回说：“林妈。”尤氏便命：“叫了他来。”丫头们走至下房，叫了林之孝家的过来。尤氏命他脚踏上坐了，一面忙着梳洗，一面问他：“这一包银子共多少？”林之孝家的回说：“这是我们底下人的银子，凑了送过来。老太太和太太们的还没有呢。”正说着，丫头们回说：“那府里的姨太太打发人送了分子来了。”尤氏笑骂道：“小蹄子们，专会记得这些没要紧的话。昨儿不过是老太太一时高兴，故意儿的学那小家子凑分子，你们就记得了，到了你们嘴里当正经话说。还不快接进来呢。”丫头们笑着忙接银子进来，一共两封，连宝钗、黛玉的都有了。尤氏问：“还少谁的？”林之孝家的道：“还少老太太、太太、姑娘们的，我们底下姑娘们的。”尤氏道：“还有你们大奶奶的呢？”林之孝家的道：“奶奶过去，这银子都从二奶奶手里发，一共都有了。”\n　　说着，尤氏梳洗了，命人伺候车辆。一时来至荣府，先来见凤姐，只见凤姐已将银子封好，正要送去。尤氏问：“都齐了么？”凤姐笑道：“都有了，快拿去罢，丢了我不管。”尤氏笑道：“我有些信不及，倒要当面点一点。”说着，果然按数一点，只没有李纨的一分。尤氏笑道：“我说你闹鬼呢，怎么你大嫂子的没有？”凤姐笑道：“那么些还不够？就短一分儿也罢了。等不够了，我再找给你。”尤氏道：“昨儿你在人跟前做情，今儿又来和我赖，这我可不依你。我只和老太太要去。”凤姐笑道：“我看你利害，明儿有了事，我也丁是丁卯是卯的，你也别抱怨。\n”尤氏笑道：“只这一分儿不给也罢了，要不看你素日孝敬我，我本来依你么？”说着，把平儿的一分也拿出来，说道：“平儿来，把你的收了去，等不够了，我替你添上。”平儿会意，笑道：“奶奶先使着，若剩下了，再赏我一样。”尤氏笑道：“只许你主子作弊，就不许我作情吗？”平儿只得收了。尤氏又道：“我看着你主子这么细致，弄这些钱，那里使去？使不了，明儿带了棺材里使去？”一面说着，一面又往贾母处来。先请了安，大概说了两句话，便走到鸳鸯房中，和鸳鸯商议，只听鸳鸯的主意行事，何以讨贾母喜欢。二人计议妥当。尤氏临走时，也把鸳鸯的二两银子还他，说：“这还使不了呢。”说着，一径出来，又至王夫人跟前说了一回话，因王夫人进了佛堂，把彩云的一分也还了他。凤姐儿不在跟前，一时把周赵二人的也还了。他两个还不敢收，尤氏道：“你们可怜见的，那里有这些闲钱？凤丫头便知道了，有我应着呢。”二人听说，千恩万谢的收了。\n　　转眼已是九月初二日，园中人都打听得尤氏办得十分热闹，不但有戏，连耍百戏并说书的女先儿全有，都打点着取乐玩耍。李纨又向众姐妹道：“今儿是正经社日，可别忘了。宝玉也不来，想必他不知，又贪住什么玩意儿，把这事又忘了。”说着，便命丫头：“去瞧做什么呢，快请了来。”丫头去了半日，回说：“花大姐姐说，今儿一早就出门去了。”众人听了都诧异，说：“再没有出门之理。这丫头糊涂！”因又命翠墨去。一时翠墨回来，说：“可不真出门了。说有个朋友死了，出去探丧去了。”探春道：“断然没有的事。凭他什么，再没有今日出门之理。你叫袭人来，我问他。”刚说着，只见袭人走来，李纨等都说道：“今儿凭他有什么事，也不该出门。头一件，你二奶奶的生日，老太太都这么高兴，两府上下都凑热闹儿，他倒走了？第二件，又是头一社的正日子，也不告假，就私自去了！”袭人叹道：“昨儿晚上就说了，今儿一早有要紧的事，到北静王府里去，就赶着回来。劝他别去，他必不依。今儿一早起来，又要素衣裳穿，想必是北静王府里要紧的什么人没了也未可知。”李纨等道：“若果如此，也该去走走，只是也该回来了。”说着，大家又商议：“咱们只管作诗，等他来罚他。”正说着，只见贾母打发人来请，便都往前头去了。袭人回明宝玉的事，贾母不乐，便命人接去。\n　　原来宝玉心里有件心事，于头一日就吩咐焙茗：“明日一早出门，备两匹马在后门口等着，不用别人跟着。说给李贵，我往北府里去了，倘或要有人找我，叫他拦住不用找。只说北府里留下了，横竖就来的。”焙茗也摸不着头脑，只得依言说了，今儿一早果然备了两匹马，在园后门等着。天亮了，只见宝玉遍体纯素，从角门出来，一语不发跨上马，一弯腰顺着街就蹭下去了。焙茗也只得跨上马，加鞭赶上，在后面忙问：“往那里去？”宝玉道：“这条路是往那里去的？”焙茗道：“这是出北门的大道。出去了冷清清，没有什么玩的。”宝玉听说，点头道：“正要冷清清的地方。”说着，越发加了两鞭，那马早已转了两个弯子，出了城门。焙茗越发不得主意，只得紧紧的跟着。\n　　一气跑了七八里路出来，人烟渐渐稀少，宝玉方勒住马，回头问焙茗道：“这里可有卖香的？”焙茗道：“香倒有，不知是那一样？”宝玉想到别的香不好，须得檀、芸、降三样。焙茗笑道：“这三样可难得。”宝玉为难。焙茗见他为难，因问道：“要香做什么使？我见二爷时常带的小荷包儿有散香，何不找找？”一句提醒了宝玉，便回手衣襟上挂着个荷包摸了一摸，竟有两星沉速，心内喜欢：“只是不恭些。”再想：“自己亲身带的，倒比买的又好些。”于是又问炉炭，焙茗道：“这可罢了，荒郊野外，那里有？既用这些，何不早说，带了来岂不便宜？”宝玉道：“糊涂东西，要可以带了来，又不这样没命的跑了。”焙茗想了半日，笑道：“我得了个主意，不知二爷心下如何，我想来二爷不止用这个，只怕还要用别的，这也不是事。如今我们索性往前再走二里，就是水仙庵了。”宝玉听了，忙问：“水仙庵就在这里？更好了，我们就去。”说着就加鞭前行，一面回头向焙茗道：“这水仙庵的姑子长往咱们家去，这一去到那里和他借香炉使使，他自然是肯的。”焙茗道：“别说是咱们家的香火，就是平日不认识的庙里，和他借，他也不敢驳回。只是一件，我常见二爷是厌这水仙庵的，如何今儿又这样喜欢了？”宝玉道：“我素日最恨俗人不知原故混供神，混盖庙。这都是当日有钱的老公们和那些有钱的愚妇们，听见有个神，就盖起庙来供着，也不知那神是何人，因听些野史小说便信真了。比如这水仙庵里面，因供的是洛神，故名水仙庵。殊不知古来并没有个洛神，那原是曹子建的谎话，谁知这起愚人就塑了像供着。今儿却合我的心事，故借他一用。”\n　　说着，早已来至门前。那老姑子见宝玉来了，事出意外，竟象天上掉下个活龙来的一般，忙上来问好，命老道来接马。宝玉进去，也不拜洛神之像，却只管赏鉴。虽是泥塑的，却真有那“翩若惊鸿，婉若游龙”、“荷出渌波，日映朝霞”的姿态。宝玉不觉滴下泪来。老姑子献了茶，宝玉因和他借香炉烧香。那姑子去了半日，连香供纸马都预备了来。宝玉说道：“一概不用。”命焙茗捧着炉出至后园中，拣一块干净地方儿，竟拣不出。焙茗道：“那井台上如何？”宝玉点头。\n　　一齐来至井台上，将炉放下，焙茗站过一旁。宝玉掏出香来焚上，含泪施了半礼，回身命收了去。焙茗答应，且不收，忙爬下磕了几个头，口内祝道：“我焙茗跟二爷这几年，二爷的心事我没有不知道的，只有今儿这一祭祀，没有告诉我，我也不敢问。只是受祭的阴魂，虽不知名姓，想来自然是那人间有一、天上无双，极聪明清雅的一位姐姐妹妹了。二爷的心事难出口，我替二爷祝赞你，你若有灵有圣，我们二爷这样想着你，你也时常来望候望候二爷，未尝不可。你在阴间，保佑二爷来生也变个女孩儿，和你们一处玩耍，岂不两下里都有趣了？”说毕又磕了几个头，才爬起来。\n　　宝玉听他没说完，便掌不住笑了。因踢他道：“别胡说，看人听见笑话。”焙茗起来，收过香炉，和宝玉走着，因道：“我已经合姑子说了，二爷还没用饭，叫他收拾了些东西，二爷勉强吃些。我知道今儿里头大排筵宴，热闹非常，二爷为此才躲了来的。横竖在这里清净一天，也就尽乐了，要不吃东西，断使不得。”宝玉道：“戏酒不吃，这随便的吃些也不妨。”焙茗道：“这才是。还有一说，咱们来了，必有人不放心。若没有人不放心，便晚些进城何妨？若有人不放心，二爷须得进城回家去才是。第一老太太、太太也放了心，第二礼也尽了，不过这么着。就是家去听戏喝酒，也并不是爷有意，原是陪着父母尽个孝道儿。要单为这个，不顾老太太、太太悬心，就是才受祭的阴魂儿也不安哪。二爷想我这话怎么样？”宝玉笑道：“你的意思我猜着了。你想着只你一个跟了我出来，回来你怕担不是，所以拿这大题目来劝我。我才来了，不过为尽个礼，再去吃酒看戏，并没说一日不进城。这已经完了心愿，赶着进城，大家放心就是了。”焙茗道：“这更好。”\n　　说着二人来至禅堂，果然那姑子收拾了一桌好素菜。宝玉胡乱吃了些，焙茗也吃了。二人便上马，仍回旧路。焙茗在后面，只嘱咐：“二爷好生骑着。这马总没大骑，手提紧着些儿。”一面说着，早已进了城，仍从后门进去，忙忙来至怡红院中。袭人等都不在屋里，只有几个老婆子看屋子，见他来了，都喜的眉开眼笑道：“阿弥陀佛，可来了！没把姑娘急疯了呢。上头正坐席呢，二爷去罢。”宝玉听说，忙将素衣脱了，自己找了颜色吉服换上，便问道：“都在什么地方坐席呢？”老婆子们回道：“在新盖的大花厅上呢。”\n　　宝玉听了，一径往花厅上来，耳内早隐隐闻得萧管歌吹之声。刚到穿堂那边，只见玉钏儿独坐在廊檐下垂泪，一见宝玉来了，便长出了一口气，砸着嘴儿说道：“嗳！凤凰来了，快进去罢！再一会子不来，可就都反了。”宝玉陪笑道：“你猜我往那里去了？”玉钏儿把身一扭，也不理他，只管拭泪，宝玉只得怏怏的进去了。到了花厅上，见了贾母、王夫人等，众人真如得了“凤凰”一般。贾母先问道：“你往那里去了，这早晚才来？还不给你姐姐行礼去呢！”因笑着又向凤姐儿道：“你兄弟不知好歹，就有要紧的事，怎么也不说一声儿就私自跑了，这还了得。明儿再这样，等你老子回家，必告诉他打你。”凤姐儿笑道：“行礼倒是小事，宝兄弟明儿断不可不言语一声儿，也不传人跟着就出去。街上车马多，头一件叫人不放心。再也不象咱们这样人家出门的规矩。”这里贾母又骂跟的人：“为什么都听他的话，说往那里去就去了，也不回一声儿！”一面又问：“他到底往那里去了？可吃了什么没有？唬着了没有？”宝玉只回说：“北静王的一个爱妾没了，今日给他道恼去。我见他哭的那样，不好撇下他就回来，所以多等了会子。”贾母道：“以后再私自出门，不先告诉我，一定叫你老子打你！”宝玉连忙答应着。贾母又要打跟的人。众人又劝道：“老太太也不必生气了．他已经答应不敢了，况且回来又没事，大家该放心乐一会子了。”贾母先不放心，自然着急发狠；今见宝玉回来，喜且有余，那里还恨？也就不提了。还怕他不受用，或者别处没吃饭，路上着了惊恐，反又百般的哄他。袭人早已过来伏侍，大家仍旧听戏。\n　　当日演的是《荆钗记》，贾母薛姨妈等都看的心酸落泪，也有笑的，也有恨的，也有骂的。\n要知端底，下回分解。",
  "translation": "Lady Dowager Jia had caught a slight chill in the Garden the other day, but it was nothing serious and two doses of medicine from the doctor had set her right. Lady Wang sent for Xifeng and told her to prepare the things to be sent to her husband. As they were discussing this, a maid came to say that the Lady Dowager wanted them. Lady Wang promptly took Xifeng along to the old lady’s apartment.\n\n“Are you feeling better now, madam?” she asked.\n\n“Quite all right again today,” was the reply. “Just now they brought me some venison broth; I tasted it and found it quite good, so I ate two pieces of the meat too and it seemed to agree with me.”\n\n“That was Xifeng’s idea,” said Lady Wang. “She thought that might tempt you. It shows her good heart, and that you haven’t spoiled her for nothing.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager nodded.\n\n“I appreciate her thoughtfulness. If there’s any more of that venison, fry a couple of pieces — the salted kind is good with gruel. That broth is all right, but not for eating with rice.”\n\nXifeng promptly promised to have this done and sent word to the kitchen.\n\n“I didn’t ask you over for anything else,” the old lady told Lady Wang. “The second of next month is Xifeng’s birthday. I’ve been meaning to celebrate it for her the last couple of years, but each time something cropped up at the last moment to prevent it. Now this year everyone’s here and we’ve nothing special on, so why not have a good time together?”\n\n“I’ve been thinking the same,” replied Lady Wang. “If you’re in the mood for it, let’s decide on it now.”\n\n“I’ve been thinking, too, that each of us giving her a present in the usual way is rather commonplace and lacking in intimacy. I’ve a new idea — a way for us all to have some fun without standing on ceremony.”\n\n“Whatever you think best, madam, we’ll do.”\n\n“My idea is that we should follow the practice of poor families and all pool together. However much we raise, we’ll spend on her birthday. What do you think of that?”\n\n“Very good. But how are we to raise the money?”\n\nThis so delighted the Lady Dowager that she sent at once for Aunt Xue and Lady Hsing, as well as the young ladies and Baoyu, and also invited Madam You from the other mansion, Lai Da’s wife and some of the stewards’ wives who were of higher standing. The maids and serving-women, infected by the old lady’s enthusiasm, hurried off in different directions to issue these invitations. In less time than it takes for a meal the room was packed with people old and young, high and low. Aunt Xue alone sat with the Lady Dowager, while Lady Hsing and Lady Wang perched on two chairs by the door. Baochai and four or five other girls sat on the couch, and Baoyu nestled in his grandmother’s lap. The floor was crowded with standing women, until the old lady ordered small stools to be brought for a few of the older, most respected nurses such as Lai Da’s mother. For it was the custom in the Jia household for elderly servants who had waited on the parents of the house to be shown more respect than young masters or mistresses. So although Madam You and Xifeng were standing, these three or four old nurses were sitting on stools.\n\nThe Lady Dowager now gaily explained her idea to the rest, and who was not eager to show her good will by joining in? Some liked Xifeng, some were afraid of her and eager to curry favour; and all could afford it. So one and all expressed approval.\n\n“I’ll give twenty taels,” the Lady Dowager announced first.\n\n“Of course I’ll follow your lead and give the same, madam,” said Aunt Xue.\n\n“We daren’t rank ourselves with the old lady,” said Lady Hsing and Lady Wang. “We’ll each give sixteen taels.”\n\n“We of the younger generation naturally should give less,” said Madam You and Li Wan. “We’ll each give twelve taels.”\n\n“That’s fine,” said the Lady Dowager. “I was meaning to excuse you\n\nShe said, “You’re a widow with no means of support; how can we ask you to pay? I’ll pay for you.”\n\n“Don’t be in such a hurry to be so generous, madam,” interposed Xifeng hastily. “First work out how much you’ll have to pay. You’re down for two shares already, and if you pay for my sister-in-law too that will be twelve more taels. It sounds all right, but presently when you think it over you’ll feel sorry and complain that all this money has been spent because of me. Then you’ll think up some clever way to make me pay three or four times that amount on the sly to make it up to you, while I’m still in the dark.”\n\nThis set everyone laughing.\n\n“Well, what do you suggest?” asked the Lady Dowager.\n\n“Her birthday hasn’t come yet, and already I’m weighed down with favours. I can’t have all these people spending money on my account. I’d feel uncomfortable. So let me pay for my sister-in-law. When the day comes, I can eat more and have a good time — that will be my reward.”\n\nLady Xing and the others approved, and the Lady Dowager agreed to this.\n\n“I’ve another suggestion,” continued Xifeng. “Our Old Ancestress is down for twenty taels and for Cousin Lin and Cousin Bao too; and Aunt Xue is down for twenty taels and for Cousin Chai too. That’s fair enough. But our two mistresses are only down for sixteen taels each. They’re paying for no one, yet their share is smaller. That’s not fair. Our Old Ancestress is the loser.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager chuckled.\n\n“Now I see why my Xifeng is so dear to me. She’s quite right. If not for her, I’d have been fooled again.”\n\n“Just hand over the two young masters to our mistresses,” proposed Xifeng. “Let each pay for one. That’s all that’s needed.”\n\n“That’s fair. Let it be so,” the Lady Dowager agreed.\n\nLai Da’s mother rose to her feet then to say with a smile, “This is all topsy-turvy. I feel like taking our mistresses’ part. On the one side are their daughters-in-law, on the other their nieces; but instead of siding with their mothers-in-law and aunts, they take other people’s part. Their daughters-in-law have become ‘outsiders’ and their nieces ‘out-laws’!”\n\nThis set the Lady Dowager and all the others laughing.\n\nThen Lai Da’s mother asked, “Since the young mistresses are paying twelve taels, naturally we should pay less?”\n\n“Certainly not,” replied the Lady Dowager. “Though your rank is lower, I know you’re all wealthy. Your position may be low but your money is more than theirs. You must pay the same.”\n\nThe stewards’ wives had to agree to this.\n\n“As for the young ladies,” the old lady went on, “they’re only doing this for fun. Each can give one month’s allowance.”\n\nShe turned to tell Yuanyang, “You girls had better get together too and decide how much to give.”\n\nYuanyang assented and went off, to return after a little with Pinger, Xiren, Caixia and some other maids. Some gave two taels, some one.\n\n“Aren’t you going to give your mistress anything apart from this?” the Lady Dowager asked Pinger. “Why are you joining in here?”\n\n“This is the public collection,” said Pinger with a smile. “I shall give her something privately too.”\n\n“That’s a good girl.”\n\n“Now that’s settled from top to bottom,” remarked Xifeng. “But we should ask the two concubines whether they mean to contribute or not. We ought to ask them, otherwise they may think we’re looking down on them.”\n\n“Of course,” agreed the Lady Dowager. “How could I have forgotten them? They may be busy, though. Send a maid to ask.”\n\nOne had already left to do this, and now came back to announce, “They’re each giving two taels.”\n\nThe Lady Dowager was pleased. “Fetch brush and ink and work out how much that comes to altogether,” she said.\n\n“You’ve got more than enough, you crazy thing,” Xiren whispered to Xifeng.\n\nSome of the ladies here have clubbed together to give you a birthday present, yet you’re still not satisfied and have to drag in a couple of ‘bitter gourds’ as well.” Xifeng chuckled, “Don’t talk nonsense. Wait till we leave here; then I’ll settle accounts with you. Why call them poor? If they have money, they’ll only give it to others for nothing. Better ask them over to join in our fun.”\n\nBy now the money had been collected, more than a hundred and fifty taels in all.\n\n“You couldn’t spend so much in one day on opera and a feast,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\n“We’re not inviting any outside guests, and we shan’t need many tables,” said Madam You. “This should be enough for two or three days. Best of all, we shan’t have to pay for the opera — that’s a big saving.”\n\n“Just tell whichever troupe Xifeng fancies to come,” said the Lady Dowager.\n\n“We know all the operas of our own actresses by heart,” objected Xifeng. “Better spend a few strings of cash to hire another company.”\n\n“I’m leaving this to your sister-in-law,” said the Lady Dowager. “Don’t let Xifeng lift a finger. Let her just enjoy herself today as my guest.” Madam You assented.\n\nAfter a little more conversation, seeing that the old lady was tired, they gradually dispersed.\n\nWhen Madam You had seen Lady Xing and Lady Wang out, she went to Xifeng’s room to discuss the birthday celebrations.\n\n“Don’t ask me,” said Xifeng. “Just do whatever you think the old lady would like.”\n\n“You creature, what a stroke of luck you’ve had!” chuckled Madam You. “I wondered what we were wanted for. So it was just for this. I’ve had to fork out and am expected to do the work into the bargain. How are you going to thank me?”\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” retorted Xifeng. “I didn’t ask you to come. Why should I thank you? If you’re afraid of the trouble, go back now and tell the old lady to appoint someone else.”\n\n“Look at her, quite puffed up!” cried Madam You, laughing. “I advise you not to get too cocky. If you’re too full, you’ll slop over.” They chatted for a while longer before she left.\n\nThe next day the contributions were sent to the Ning Mansion. Madam You, who had just got up and was washing, asked who had brought them.\n\n“Mother Lin,” her maids told her.\n\nShe sent to have her called in, and when Lin Zhixiao’s wife came asked her to sit on the footstool while she went on with her toilet.\n\n“How much is there in this package?” she asked.\n\n“It’s the contributions from the servants,” was the answer. “The ladies haven’t sent theirs yet.”\n\nAs she was speaking in came some maids to announce, “The other house has sent the concubines’ contributions.”\n\n“Saucy minxes!” scolded Madam You. “You only remember what doesn’t matter. The old lady was just in high spirits yesterday, playing at being poor to raise a subscription, and you take it so seriously that you have to report it. Why didn’t you hurry up and take the money?”\n\nThe maids had come in smiling to hand over two packets of silver, which included contributions from Baochai and Daiyu too.\n\n“Whose is still missing?” asked Madam You.\n\n“The old lady’s, the mistresses’ and the young ladies’,” said Lin Zhixiao’s wife. “And that of the young mistresses in our household.”\n\n“What about your elder mistress?”\n\n“As she’s in mourning, Madam Lian is handling everything, so it’s all here.”\n\nBy now Madam You had finished her toilet and ordered her carriage. Upon arrival at the Rong Mansion, she went first to see Xifeng, who had wrapped up the silver and was about to send it over.\n\n“Is this everything?” asked Madam You.\n\n“Yes, that’s the lot,” said Xifeng gaily. “Take it away quickly. If you lose it, it’s not my responsibility.”\n\n“I don’t altogether trust you. I must check it in your presence.”\n\nShe proceeded to count it, and found that only the senior\n\n“And there’s one for Li Wan too.”\n\n“So you are up to your tricks!” cried Madam You with a smile. “How is it there’s nothing for your elder sister-in-law?”\n\n“Isn’t that plenty?” Xifeng retorted. “What does it matter if one is short? If you need more, I’ll make it up to you later.”\n\n“Yesterday you made a show of generosity in front of everyone, but today you go back on your word. I won’t stand for that. I shall ask the old lady for it.”\n\nXifeng smiled. “How hard you are on me! In future if I’m strict with you, don’t complain.”\n\n“If you don’t give me this one share, all right,” countered Madam You. “If not for the respect you usually show me, do you think I’d let you off?”\n\nWith that she produced Pinger’s share too.\n\n“Come here, Pinger,” she said. “Take yours. If it’s not enough, I’ll make it up to you later.”\n\nPinger caught on and replied with a smile, “Keep it for now, madam. If there’s any left over, you can give it to me then.”\n\n“Is your mistress the only one allowed to play tricks?” demanded Madam You. “Why shouldn’t I do a good turn?”\n\nThen Pinger had to accept the silver.\n\n“Your mistress is so shrewd and careful, always scraping money together,” Madam You went on. “What does she want with all this? If she can’t spend it in this life, will she take it to her grave?”\n\nAs she was speaking she went on to the Lady Dowager’s apartments. Having paid her respects and chatted for a little, she went to Yuanyang’s room to consult her, ready to act on her advice as to how to please the old lady. The two of them put their heads together and decided on a plan. And when Madam You left, she returned Yuanyang’s two taels to her.\n\n“I don’t need this,” she said.\n\nThen she went to Lady Wang and chatted with her for a while. And as her mistress had entered the Buddha hall, she returned Caiyun’s share to her. Xifeng being absent, she returned the shares of the two other concubines Chou and Zhao too. Not daring to accept, they demurred until Madam You said, “Don’t be so silly. You can’t afford to throw away money like this. If Xifeng finds out, I’ll take the responsibility.”\n\nOnly then did they accept with profuse thanks.\n\nThe second of the ninth month soon arrived, and everyone in the Garden had heard that Madam You was making lively preparations, not only with operas but variety shows and story-tellers as well, so they were all looking forward to a day of fun.\n\n“This is the day of our first club meeting, so don’t forget,” Li Wan told the girls. “Baoyu hasn’t come either. I suppose he doesn’t know, or has forgotten again because he’s so carried away by some game or other.”\n\nShe ordered a maid to go and see what he was doing and ask him over. After some time the maid came back to report, “Sister Xiren says he went out first thing this morning.”\n\nThey were all amazed.\n\n“That’s impossible,” they cried. “The silly creature must have made a mistake.”\n\nLi Wan sent Cuimo to find out, and she returned to announce, “He really has gone out. They say a friend has died and he’s gone to offer condolences.”\n\n“Impossible,” said Tanchun. “Whatever the reason, he couldn’t have gone out today. Send for Xiren. I want to ask her.”\n\nAs she spoke Xiren arrived.\n\nLi Wan and the others told her, “No matter how urgent the business, he shouldn’t have gone out today. In the first place, this is your Second Mistress’ birthday and even the old lady is in such high spirits that everyone, high and low, in both mansions has joined in the fun — why should he be the only one to stay away? In the second place, this is the first day of our club, and he’s gone off without asking for leave.”\n\nXiren sighed. “Last night he told me he had something very important to do today in the Prince of Beijing’s palace, but he’d come back as quickly as possible. I advised him not to go, but he wouldn’t listen. When he got up this morning he wanted to put on plain clothes, so maybe someone important in the prince’s household has died.”\n\n“In that case he should have gone,” conceded Li Wan. “But he ought to be back by now.”\n\nThey were just saying, “Let’s go on with our verse-making and leave him to be punished when he comes,” when the Lady Dowager sent to fetch them and they all went to her apartments.\n\nXiren reported Baoyu’s absence and, as this vexed his grandmother, she sent to fetch him.\n\nNow Baoyu had been preoccupied with a certain matter. The previous day he had ordered Beiming, “First thing tomorrow, have two horses ready saddled and waiting at the back gate. Don’t let anyone else follow us. Just tell Li Gui I’m going to the Northern Mansion; and if anyone asks for me, he must stop them and say I’ve been kept there but will be back soon.” Beiming could not make out what was in the wind, but he had to do as he was told. So early that morning he had two horses ready at the back gate of the Garden.\n\nAt daybreak Baoyu, dressed entirely in white, slipped out by the side gate. Without a word he mounted his horse and, bending low in the saddle, galloped off down the street. Beiming had to mount too and whip his horse to catch up.\n\n“Where are we going?” he called.\n\n“Where does this road lead?” asked Baoyu.\n\n“This is the highway out by the north gate. Once outside it’s very quiet — there’s nothing to see.”\n\n“That’s the sort of place I want.”\n\nAs Baoyu said this he whipped his horse again and it galloped off so fast that after a couple of turns they were through the city gate. Beiming had no choice but to follow closely.\n\nThey rode seven or eight miles before the countryside grew more deserted, and then Baoyu reined in his horse to ask Beiming, “Is there anywhere here that sells incense?”\n\n“Yes, but what kind do you want?”\n\nBaoyu reflected that no other kind would do: he must have sandalwood, aloeswood and eaglewood.\n\n“Those three kinds are hard to get,” said Beiming with a smile.\n\nBaoyu was nonplussed.\n\n“What do you want incense for?” asked Beiming. “I’ve often noticed that you have some in that little pouch you carry. Why not look and see?”\n\nThis reminded Baoyu. He felt the pouch hanging from his gown and, sure enough, there were two pinches of incense in it.\n\n“That’s good,” he thought, “though it’s rather informal.” Then it struck him that this personal incense of his was better than any he could buy. So he asked about an incense-burner.\n\n“We’re out of luck there,” said Beiming. “We can’t find one in these wilds. If you’d told me earlier, master, I could have brought one and saved us all this frantic riding.”\n\n“Stupid fool! If I could have brought it, I wouldn’t have raced here like this.”\n\nAfter some thought Beiming proposed, “I’ve an idea, but I don’t know if it will suit you. I fancy you need other things too, and this won’t do. If we go another couple of miles, we’ll come to the Shuixian Nunnery.”\n\n“Is the Shuixian Nunnery near here?” cried Baoyu eagerly. “So much the better. Let’s go there.”\n\nHe whipped his horse and set off again, turning back to tell Beiming, “The nun there often comes to our house. When we get there I’ll borrow an incense-burner from her — she’s sure to agree.”\n\n“Of course. Even if she didn’t know us, she wouldn’t dare refuse. But there’s one thing: I’ve often noticed that you hate this Shuixian Nunnery; how is it you’re so eager to go there today?”\n\n“I loathe it because people worship idols so blindly, building shrines to any spirit. When rich eunuchs and silly rich women hear that there’s some god they make a temple to him at once, not even knowing his origin — they believe all the nonsense written in romantic tales. For instance, this Shuixian Nunnery is dedicated to the Goddess of the River Luo, hence its name. But there never was any such goddess. It was simply invented by Cao Zijian. Yet these stupid people have built a temple and set up an idol.\n\nHe was being treated like an idol. But today he suits my mood, so I’ll borrow him.”\n\nBy now they had reached the gate. The sight of Baoyu took the old nun completely by surprise. It was as if a live dragon had dropped from Heaven. She hurried over to greet him and told the old serving-man to take his horse. Once inside, instead of paying homage to the image of the goddess, Baoyu simply stood gazing at it. Although only a clay statue, it had the charm of “a startled swan or drifting dragon” and the brilliance of “a lotus rising from green water or sun shining through morning mist.” Despite himself, Baoyu shed tears.\n\nThe old nun brought tea, and he asked to borrow an incense-burner in which to burn incense. She was away for some time, returning not only with an incense-burner but with paper offerings as well.\n\n“I don’t need those,” said Baoyu.\n\nHe told Beiming to carry the incense-burner to the back garden and find a clean spot for it, but no clean spot could be found.\n\n“What about the well?” suggested Beiming.\n\nBaoyu nodded.\n\nThey went to the well and set the burner down there. Beiming stepped aside while Baoyu took out the incense and lit it, then bowed with tears in his eyes. When he turned and ordered the incense-burner to be taken away, Beiming assented but instead of removing it promptly prostrated himself and kowtowed several times.\n\n“In all the years I’ve served Second Master,” he prayed, “there’s never been anything he wanted to do that I didn’t know about. Only this sacrifice today he didn’t tell me and I didn’t venture to ask. The spirit receiving this offering, though I don’t know your name, must be one of those incomparably sweet, clever, refined young ladies, the only one of your kind on earth. Since it’s hard for my master to put his feeling into words, let me wish this for him. If you have any power, as he’s thinking of you like this why not come often to see him? And since you’re in the other world, why not ask the gods to turn him into a girl in his next life, so that he can play with you? Wouldn’t that be fun for both sides?” After this prayer he kowtowed several times again before getting up.\n\nBaoyu could not help laughing, though he had not finished.\n\n“Don’t talk such nonsense,” he said, kicking him. “If anyone hears you, they’ll laugh.”\n\nBeiming picked up the incense-burner.\n\n“I’ve told the nun that you haven’t eaten,” he said as they walked away. “I asked her to prepare a meal, and hope you’ll take something. I know that’s why you slipped away — because there’s a big feasts and operas today and it’s so rowdy. Still, you may as well enjoy the quiet here for a day, but you must eat something.”\n\n“It’s all right to have a simple meal instead of the feast and opera.”\n\n“Good. But there’s another thing. Our coming out like this is bound to worry some people. If no one is worried, what does it matter if we go back to town late? But if they are, you ought to go home. In the first place, that would set the old lady and Her Ladyship’s minds at rest. In the second, you’d have done your duty by them. Even if you go home to watch operas and drink, that’s not what you want but you’d be doing it to please your parents. If you don’t go back, and the old lady and Her Ladyship are worried, even the spirit you sacrificed to just now would be upset. What do you say to that, Second Master?”\n\n“I know what’s on your mind.” Baoyu smiled. “You came out with me and you’re afraid you may be blamed for it, so you’re using these high-sounding reasons to persuade me. Actually, I only came to offer a sacrifice. I never said I wouldn’t go back to the feast and opera, or that I’d stay out for the whole day. Now that I’ve done what I meant to do, we’ll hurry back to set their minds at rest.”\n\n“Splendid,” said Beiming.\n\nThey went to the meditation hall, where the nun had indeed prepared a table of tasty vegetarian fare. Baoyu ate a little and Beiming finished the rest. Then they mounted their horses and started back the way they had come.\n\n“Mind how you ride, Second Master,” Beiming called from behind. “This horse hasn’t been ridden much. Hold the reins tightly.”\n\n\"Quick, now!\" As he spoke they entered the city by the back gate and he hurried to Happy Red Court. Since Xiren and the other girls were not there, only a few old nannies left in charge, at sight of him they beamed with delight.\n\n\"Amida Buddha!\" they cried. \"Here you are! Our young lady was nearly out of her mind. They've started the feast already. Go along, young master.\"\n\nBaoyu hastily changed out of his mourning clothes and into some colourful festive wear, then asked where the feast was being held.\n\n\"In the new large hall,\" the nurses told him.\n\nHe hurried there. He could hear flutes and singing in the distance. As he passed through an entrance hall, he saw Yuanyang sitting alone under the eaves of the verandah, wiping away tears. At sight of him she sighed.\n\n\"So the phoenix is back!\" she exclaimed. \"Go quickly inside. If you'd been any later, all hell would have broken loose.\"\n\nSmiling, Baoyu said, \"Do you know where I've been?\"\n\nShe turned away and, ignoring him, went on wiping her eyes. He had to hurry on then, rather sheepishly, to the large hall. When the Lady Dowager and Lady Wang saw him they acted as if they had recovered a lost treasure.\n\n\"Where have you been all this time?\" the old lady scolded. \"Why don't you go and pay your respects to your cousin?\"\n\nShe told Xifeng with a smile, \"Your brother doesn't know what's good for him. Even if he had some urgent business, he should have told us instead of sneaking off like that. This is outrageous. If he does it again, when your father comes home I shall certainly have him given a good thrashing.\"\n\nXifeng smiled. \"That's a small matter. The important thing is that you shouldn't go out without a word to anyone or taking attendants, Baoyu. There are so many carriages and horses in the streets, we can't help worrying. That's no way for a young gentleman from a family like ours to go out.\"\n\nThe old lady then scolded his servants. \"Why do you always do whatever he says? If he tells you to go somewhere, you just go without a word to anyone. Where did he go? Has he had anything to eat? Was he frightened?\"\n\nHe explained, \"I went to offer condolences to the Prince of Beijing whose favourite concubine had died. She was crying so bitterly, I didn't like to leave her and come away; that's why I stayed so long.\"\n\n\"In future, if you go out without telling me first, I'll certainly have your father thrash you,\" she threatened.\n\nBaoyu promised to obey, and the old lady wanted to have his servants beaten. The others intervened.\n\n\"Don't be angry, madam,\" they begged. \"He's promised not to do it again, and as he's back safe and sound we should all stop worrying and enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nActually, the old lady had been so frantic with anxiety that now, overjoyed as she was to see him back, she had no heart to be angry. Besides, she was afraid he might be feeling upset, might not have eaten or have been frightened on the road, so she did her best to comfort him. And as Xiren had come now to wait on him, they all settled down again to watch the opera.\n\nThe opera that day was The Thorn Hairpin. It reduced the Lady Dowager and Aunt Xue to tears, and some of the audience were exclaiming indignantly or with anger. But to know what followed, you must read the next chapter."
